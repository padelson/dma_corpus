2.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NAL at the Effective

2.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
in the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) or on such
other date, time or place as FNFG and NAL otherwise agree (the " _Closing
Date_ "). 

  

2.03 _Effective Time_. Promptly following the Closing, Merger Sub and NAL will
duly execute, acknowledge and file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate
of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
"). 

   

2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. 

   

(a) The Merger will have the effects as are prescribed by this Agreement and
applicable law, including the DGCL. 

 

    #####

2.06 _Bank Merger_. The parties will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined following the Merger. At

of First Niagara Bank, as then in effect, will be the by-laws of Surviving
Bank. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

   

3.01 _Conversion or Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of NAL Stock or Merger Sub Stock: 

   

(a) _NAL Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this Article III,
each share of NAL Common Stock (whether or not subject to restriction) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares) will be converted into and constitute, as provided in and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive
at the election of the holder thereof as provided in, and as adjusted
pursuant to, Section 3.02, the following consideration (in the aggregate for
all such shares of NAL Common Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ "): 

   

(1) for each such share of NAL Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to Section 3.02 (a " _Cash Election_ "), cash, without interest, in
an amount equal to $14.28 (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") (collectively, the "
_Cash Election Shares_ "); 

   

(2) for each such share of NAL Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive FNFG Common Stock has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 3.02 (a " _Stock Election_ "), that
number of shares of FNFG Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (the
" _Stock Consideration_ ") (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ ");
or 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) for each such share of NAL Common Stock other than shares as to which
a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 3.02 (collectively, the "
_Non-Election Shares_ "), the Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration as is
determined in accordance with Section 3.02. 

   

(b) _Appraisal Rights_. Each issued and outstanding share of NAL Common
Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the per share Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. NAL
shall give FNFG prompt notice upon receipt by NAL of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of NAL Common Stock, any withdrawals
of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable
law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ "), and FNFG shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. NAL shall
not, except with the prior written consent of FNFG, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting
Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the
Surviving Entity. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at
or prior to the Effective Time, such holders shares of NAL Common
Stock shall be converted into a right to receive cash or FNFG Common Stock in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his right to such payment after the Effective Time (or the Election
Deadline), each share of NAL Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as
a Non-Election Share. 

   

(c) _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. From and after the
Effective Time, shares of NAL Common Stock shall be no longer outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and holders of
certificates (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ") formerly representing shares of
NAL Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of NAL, other
than rights to receive (without interest) (1) any then-unpaid dividend or
other distribution with respect to such NAL Common Stock having a record
date before the Effective Time and (2) the consideration to which such
holders are entitled in accordance with this Article III (or as to Dissenting
Shares, such rights as provided by the DGCL). After the Effective Time, there
will be no transfers of shares of NAL Common Stock on the stock transfer
books of NAL or the Surviving Entity, and shares of NAL Common
Stock presented to FNFG or the Surviving Entity for any reason will be
canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Article III. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 3.01 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger, each share of NAL Common Stock beneficially owned by
FNFG (other than shares held in a trust, fiduciary, or nominee capacity or as
a result of debts previously contracted) or held in NALs treasury will
be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no shares of FNFG Stock
or any other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If FNFG changes (or the FNFG Board sets
a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change
in) the number or kind of shares of FNFG Common Stock outstanding by way of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any
other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such
change. If NAL changes (or the NAL Board sets a related record date that
will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of
shares of NAL Common Stock (or Rights thereto) outstanding by way of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or
similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent
items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. 

   

(e) _Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Entity. 

   

3.02 _Election Procedures._  

   

(a) _Choice of Election_. Holders of NAL Common Stock may elect to receive 
shares of FNFG Common Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in
exchange for their  shares of NAL Common Stock in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 3.02. Shares of NAL Common Stock as to
which a Cash Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made
are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of NAL Common Stock
as to which a Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) are referred to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of NAL
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an
Election Form is not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as
"Non-Election Shares." Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash
Election Shares, and the holders thereof shall in no event
receive consideration comprised of FNFG Common Stock with respect to such
shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of making the proration
calculations provided for in this Section 3.02, only Dissenting Shares
existing at the Effective Time shall be deemed Cash Election Shares. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _Election Form_. An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such
form as NAL and FNFG shall mutually agree (" _Election Form_ "), shall be
mailed no more than 40 business days and no less than 20 business days prior
to the anticipated Effective Time or on such other date as FNFG and NAL shall
mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of NAL
Common Stock as of five business days prior to the Mailing Date (the "
_Election Form Record Date_"). Each Election Form shall permit such holder,
subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in this Section
3.02, (i) to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the shares of
NAL Common Stock held by such holder, in accordance with Section
3.01(a)(1), (ii) to elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such
shares, in accordance with Section 3.01(a)(2), (iii) to elect to receive the
Stock Consideration for a certain number of such holders shares and the Cash
Consideration for all other shares of such holders  shares (a " _Mixed
Election_ ") (all such shares together, the " _Mixed Election Shares_ "), or
(iv) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt
of cash or FNFG Common Stock for such shares. A holder of record of shares of
NAL Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another
representative capacity (a " _Stockholder Representative_ ") may submit
multiple Election Forms,  _provided_ that each such Election Form covers all
the shares of NAL Common Stock held by such Stockholder Representative for a
particular beneficial owner. Any shares of NAL Common Stock with respect to
which the holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an
election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly
completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. All Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed shares subject to a Cash Election, and with respect to
such shares the holders thereof shall in no event receive consideration
comprised of FNFG Common Stock, subject to Section 3.01(c) hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that for purposes of making the proration calculations provided
for in this Section 3.02, only Dissenting Shares as existing at the Effective
Time shall be deemed Cash Election Shares. 

   

(c) _Effectiveness; Election Deadline_. To be effective, a properly
completed Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 25th day following the Mailing Date (or
such other time and date as FNFG and NAL may mutually agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Election Deadline may not
occur on or after the Closing Date. NAL shall use its reasonable best efforts
to make available up to two separate Election Forms, or such additional
Election Forms as FNFG may permit, to all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of NAL Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline. NAL shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein. An election shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election
Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more
Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
Certificates) representing all shares of NAL Common Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included
with the Election Form. If an NAL stockholder either (i) does not submit a
properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later submitting a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline), the shares
of NAL Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be designated as Non-
Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to
the Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or change is actually
received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. FNFG
shall cause the Certificate or Certificates relating to any revoked Election
Form to be promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the
Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have discretion to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received and
whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made.
All Elections (whether Cash, Stock or Mixed) shall be revoked automatically if
the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by FNFG or NAL, upon exercise by
FNFG or NAL of its respective or their mutual rights to terminate this
Agreement to the extent provided under Article VIII, that this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with Article VIII. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Stock Elections Equal to Stock Conversion Number_. Notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares
of NAL Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(2) (the " _Stock Conversion Number_
") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate FNFG
Share Amount by (y) the Exchange Ratio. All of the other  shares of NAL
Common Stock shall be converted into Cash Consideration. 

   

(e) _Stock Consideration Proration_. If the aggregate number of shares of
NAL Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been
validly made (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Stock Conversion
Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number
of such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration. 

   

(f) _Cash Consideration Proration_. If the Stock Election Number is less
than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion
Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares and
Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: 

   

(1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or 

   

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration, and the Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof
shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect
of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (x) the Shortfall
Number exceeds (y) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the
denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(g) _Adjustment to Preserve Tax Treatment_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Aggregate FNFG Share Amount
shall be increased by the Share Adjustment Amount (as defined in this Section
3.02(g)) and the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be decreased by the product of
the Share Adjustment Amount and the Closing Price, where the " _Share
Adjustment Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the increase in
the Aggregate FNFG Share Amount required to secure the tax opinions required
by Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c). In the event that the Aggregate FNFG Share
Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount are adjusted as provided for in this
Section 3.02(g), all references in this Agreement to the "Aggregate FNFG
Share Amount" and the "Aggregate Cash Amount" shall refer to the Aggregate
FNFG Share Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount as adjusted in this
Section 3.02(g). 

   

(h) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of FNFG Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. Instead, FNFG will pay to each holder of NAL Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of FNFG Common Stock (after
taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount
in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of a share
of FNFG Common Stock by the Closing Price. 

   

3.03 _Exchange Procedures._  

   

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. After the Election Deadline and no
later than the Closing Date and until the date that is 180 days after the
Effective Time, FNFG shall make available on a timely basis or cause to be
made available to an exchange agent agreed upon by FNFG and NAL (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") (1) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Exchange
Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant to this Article III
and (2) certificates, or at FNFGs option, evidence of shares in book
entry form, representing the shares of FNFG Common Stock (" _New
Certificates_ "), each to be given to the holders of NAL Common Stock in
exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article III. On the date that
is 180 days after the Effective Time, any such cash or New Certificates
remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any
earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to (or as directed by) FNFG.
Any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his, her or
its Old Certificates pursuant to this Article III shall thereafter be
entitled to look exclusively to FNFG, and only as a general creditor thereof,
for the consideration to which he, she or it may be entitled upon exchange of
such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be
liable to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than ten days thereafter, the Surviving Entity shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of NAL Common Stock a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the
consideration to which such person may be entitled pursuant to this Article
III. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for
cancellation together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Old
Certificate shall promptly be provided in exchange therefor, but in no event
later than ten business days after due surrender, a New Certificate and a
check in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
III, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any cash or other property to
be delivered upon surrender of any Old Certificates. Each of FNFG and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of NAL Common Stock such
amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by FNFG, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holders of NAL Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by FNFG, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and such amounts shall be delivered by
FNFG, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the
applicable taxing authority. 

   

(c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash payment is
to be made in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the making of such payment in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required
for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable. If any New Certificate representing shares
of FNFG Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it
shall be a condition of such issuance that the Old Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of NAL Common Stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time with respect to FNFG Common Stock shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof
shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article III.
After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article
III, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the shares of FNFG Common
Stock represented by the New Certificate. 

   

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by FNFG or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as FNFG or the Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, FNFG or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, pay or cause to be paid
the consideration deliverable in respect of the shares formerly represented
by such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article III. 

   

3.04 _Equity Compensation_. 

   

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase shares of NAL Common Stock (each, a " _NAL
Stock Option_ ") will cease to represent an option to purchase NAL Common
Stock and will be converted automatically into an option to purchase a number
of shares of FNFG Common Stock (each, a " _FNFG Stock Option_ ") equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of shares
of NAL Common Stock subject to such NAL Stock Option and (B) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (1) the exercise price of such NAL Stock Option _divided by_ (2) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each FNFG Stock Option will become fully vested, and shall
otherwise continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the NAL Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. 

   

(b) _NAL Awards_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested right
of any kind to receive shares of NAL Common Stock and any accrued dividends
thereon which has been granted under the NAL 2005 Long-Term Compensation Plan
(other than any NAL Stock Option or Performance Award) (the " _NAL Awards_
"), will become fully vested, and will cease to represent a right to receive
shares in NAL Common Stock and will be converted automatically into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of each outstanding NAL Award,
and any accrued dividends on such NAL Awards shall be paid in cash to the
holder of such NAL Award on the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Performance Awards_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Performance Award held by a participant which has been granted under the NAL
2005 Long-Term Compensation Plan (the " _Performance Awards_ ") will become
fully vested, and the participant will receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of each outstanding Performance Award, _multiplied by_ the Pro Rata
Portion (as defined in the next sentence). For purposes of the
previous sentence, a " _Pro Rata Portion_ " with respect to each participant
shall mean the following: (i) the number of shares of NAL Common Stock
subject to the Performance Award awarded to such participant, _multiplied by_
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from
the grant date through the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is
equal to the total performance period pursuant to the NAL 2005 Long-
Term Compensation Plan to which such Performance Award is subject, and
_further multiplied by_  (iii) a percentage equal to the TSR Percentage (as
defined in, and calculated in accordance with, the applicable NAL 2005 Long-
Term Compensation Plan Award Agreement) achieved by NAL as of the Effective
Time. 

   

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each NAL Stock Option, whether or not
intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code), will be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code. 

   

(e) Before the Effective Time, FNFG will take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of FNFG Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of any FNFG Stock Options in accordance with this
Section 3.04.

in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Section 5.03 or Section 5.04, as applicable, or to
one or more of its covenants contained in Articles IV or VI; _provided_ that
the inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not by itself be deemed an admission by a

a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Sections 5.03

Act. 

   

(3) It has Previously Disclosed a list of all equity securities that it and
its Subsidiaries own, control or hold for its own account, and neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries owns more than 4.9% of a class of voting securities

this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized
by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement is its valid and legally
binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(2) The NAL Board has (A) unanimously determined that the Merger is fair
to, and in the best interests of, NAL and its stockholders, approved and
declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to recommend (the " _NAL
Recommendation_ ") adoption of this Agreement to the holders of NAL Common
Stock, and (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of
NAL Common Stock for their adoption. The NAL Board has taken all action so
that FNFG and Merger Sub will not be an "interested stockholder" or
prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
NAL (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a
result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby. 

   

(f) _Regulatory Approvals; No Defaults_.

required filings under federal and state securities laws, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (A) constitute a breach
or violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien or any
acceleration of remedies, penalty, increase in benefit payable or right of
termination under, any law, rule or regulation or any judgment, decree,
order, governmental permit or license, or agreement, indenture or instrument
of it or of any of its Subsidiaries or to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties is subject or bound, (B) constitute a
breach or violation of, or a default under, its or any of its Subsidiaries

license, agreement, indenture or instrument. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) As of the date hereof, it is not aware of any reason why the
necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to
permit consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger on a timely basis. 

   

(g) _Financial Reports and Regulatory Documents; Material Adverse Effect_. 

   

(1) Its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and all other reports, registration statements,
definitive proxy statements or information statements filed by it or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequent to December 31, 2007 under the Securities Act or
under the Exchange Act (collectively, " _NAL SEC Filings_ "), in the form
filed with the SEC as of the date filed, (A) complied in all material
respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
statements of financial position contained in or incorporated by reference
into any such NAL SEC Filing (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) fairly presented in all material respects its financial position and
that of its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the date of
such statement, and each of the statements of income and changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows or equivalent statements in such NAL SEC
Filings (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presented
in all material respects the results of operations, changes in stockholders
equity and changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of it and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the periods to which those
statements relate, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except in each case as may be noted therein, and
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and as permitted by Form 10-Q
in the case of unaudited statements. Its reserves for possible loan
repurchases have been established in conformity with GAAP, sound banking
practices and applicable law and are reasonable in view of the amount and
character of the loans or other extensions of credit which have been sold,
the loans or other extensions of credit which have been repurchased or are in
process of being repurchased, the loans or other extensions of credit which
have been identified as being at risk of repurchase, potential losses related
to current and future repurchased loans or other extensions of credit,
current economic conditions and other relevant factors. 

   

(2) It and its Subsidiaries have no liabilities, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, other than those reflected or reserved
against in its balance sheets (and the notes thereto) included in the NAL SEC
Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement and those incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30,
2010. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) Since June 30, 2010, (A) it and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with
past practice (excluding the incurrence of expenses related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby), and (B) no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with all other
facts, circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of this Section
5.03 or otherwise), has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it. 

   

(4) It has made available to FNFG true, correct and complete copies of
all written correspondence between the SEC and it and any of its Subsidiaries
occurring since December 31, 2008 and prior to the date hereof. There are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the NAL SEC Filings. 

   

(h) _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against or affecting it or any of
its Subsidiaries (and it is not aware of any basis for any such suit, action
or proceeding) (1) that involves a Governmental Authority, or (2) that,
individually or in the aggregate, is (A) material to it and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or reasonably likely to result in a restriction on its or
any of its Subsidiaries businesses or, after the Effective Time, FNFGs or
any of its Subsidiaries businesses, or (B) reasonably likely to prevent or
delay it from performing its obligations under, or consummating the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no injunction, order,
award, judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or
entered into by it, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its
Subsidiaries. 

   

(i) _Regulatory Matters_. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to, or has been advised that it is reasonably likely to become subject to,
any special procedures or restrictions imposed by any written order, decree,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a
commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory
letter from, or adopted any board resolutions at the request of, any
Governmental Authority charged with the supervision or regulation of it or any
of its Subsidiaries. There are no formal or informal investigations relating
to any regulatory matters pending before any Governmental Authority with
respect to it or its Subsidiaries. 

   

(j) _Compliance with Laws_. It and each of its Subsidiaries: 

   

(1) has, since January 1, 2008, conducted its business in compliance with
all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws,
regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable
thereto (including the rules and regulations of applicable self-regulatory
organizations) or to the employees conducting such businesses; 

   

(2) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and

Authorities that are required in order to permit them to own or lease their
properties and to conduct their businesses as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to its knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of
any of them is threatened; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) has received, since January 1, 2008, no written or, to its knowledge,

(B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or authorization of
a Governmental Authority (including with respect to FDIC deposit insurance);

understanding or similar arrangement, commitment letter or similar

(5) has no reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist that
would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (A) to be operating or
to have operated in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act,
any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation or any
rule or regulation issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of
Foreign Assets Control; (B) not to be in compliance with the applicable
privacy and customer information requirements contained in any applicable
law; or (C) to be operating or to have operated in violation of any fair

(k) _Material Contracts; Defaults_. 

   

(1) Except for those agreements and other documents filed as exhibits
or incorporated by reference to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2009 or filed or incorporated in any other NAL SEC
Filing filed since December 31, 2009 and prior to the date hereof or as
Previously Disclosed, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (each, whether or not filed with the
SEC, a " _Material Contract_ "): (A) that is a "material contract" within the
meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the SECs Regulation S-K; (B) that (i)
obligates it or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct business with another
person on an exclusive basis or restricts the ability of it or any of its
Subsidiaries to conduct business with any person, (ii) limits,
contains language that limits or would limit in any respect the manner in
which, or the localities in which, any business of it or its affiliates is or
could be conducted or the types of business that it or its affiliates conduct
or may conduct, (iii) limits, contains language that limits or would limit in
any way the ability of it or any of its Subsidiaries to solicit prospective
employees or customers or would so limit or purport to limit the ability of
FNFG or any of its affiliates to do so; (C) to which any affiliate, officer,
director, employee or consultant of it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or beneficiary (except with respect to Loans to directors, officers and
employees entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with all applicable regulatory requirements and Benefit Arrangements); (D)
for the purchase of services, materials, supplies, goods, equipment or other
assets or property that provides for, or that creates future payment
obligations in excess of, either (i) annual payments of $500,000 or more,
or (ii) aggregate payments of $1,000,000 or more; or (e) that was not entered
into in the ordinary course of business or that is material to it or its
financial condition or results of operations. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(2) Each Material Contract is a valid and legally binding agreement of it
or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to its knowledge, the
counterparty or counterparties thereto, is enforceable in accordance with its
terms and is in full force and effect. Neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, and, to its knowledge, any counterparty or counterparties, is
in breach of any provision of any Material Contract, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default. 

   

(l) _Benefit Arrangements_. 

   

(1) All Benefit Arrangements are Previously Disclosed. True and
complete copies of all Benefit Arrangements, including any trust instruments
and insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership
plan, loan agreements forming a part of any Benefit Arrangements, and all
amendments thereto have been made available to FNFG. 

   

(2) All Benefit Arrangements, other than "multiemployer plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), are
in substantial compliance, in form and operation, with their terms and ERISA,
the Code and other applicable laws (including with respect to non-
discrimination requirements, fiduciary duties and required regulatory
filings). Each Benefit Arrangement which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA
Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") covering all tax law
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within
the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code,
and NAL is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in the
loss of the qualification of any such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code. Neither NAL nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject NAL or any
Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither NAL nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or
penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
liability under Section 4071 of ERISA. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by it or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with NAL under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
" _ERISA Affiliate_ "). It and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not
expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan
under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on
contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event,"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the reporting
requirement has not been waived or extended has been required to be filed for
any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending
on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been required to
be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

   

(4) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Arrangement, as
of the date hereof, have been timely made or have been reflected in the
consolidated financial statements filed with the NAL SEC Filings. Neither any
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has
an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information
pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed
plan year. No Pension Plan is in "at risk" status within the meaning of
Section 303 of ERISA. 

   

(5) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then-current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of
such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(6) As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to its knowledge
threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit Arrangements. Neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any Benefit Arrangement or collective bargaining agreement. It
or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such Benefit Arrangement at
any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of
claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. 

   

(7) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Arrangement which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with
any other event) (A) entitle any employees of it or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit
Arrangements, (C) limit or restrict the right of it or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, NAL to merge, amend or
terminate any of the Benefit Arrangements or (D) result in payments under any
of the Benefit Arrangements which would not be deductible under Section
162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. 

   

(8) Each Benefit Arrangement which is a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (A) has been operated and
maintained in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January
1, 2009, and (B) has been operated and maintained in good faith compliance
with Section 409A of the Code for all applicable periods at all times prior
to January 1, 2009. 

   

(m) _Taxes_. 

   

(1) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed or delivered (taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file or deliver) by or
with respect to it and its Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed or
delivered, and all such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all
respects. 

   

(2) All Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (1)
or that are otherwise due and payable by it or its Subsidiaries have been
paid in full. 

   

(3) All Taxes that it or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to withhold
from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party have been paid
over to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner, to the extent
due and payable. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(4) No extensions or waivers of statutes of limitation for the assessment
of Taxes have been given by or requested in writing with respect to any of
its U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income Taxes or those of its
Subsidiaries. 

   

(5) None of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (1) is currently under
any audit, suit, proceeding, examination or assessment by the IRS or the
relevant state, local or foreign taxing authority and neither it nor its
Subsidiaries has received written notice from any taxing authority that an
audit, suit, proceeding, examination or assessment in respect of such Tax
Returns is pending or threatened. 

   

(6) No deficiencies have been asserted or assessments made against it or
its Subsidiaries by the relevant taxing authorities as a result of any audit
or examination of any of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (1). 

   

(7) No claim has been made against it or its Subsidiaries by any
taxing authorities in a jurisdiction where it or its Subsidiaries does not
file Tax Returns that it or its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction. 

   

(8) It has made provision in accordance with GAAP, in the financial
statements included in the NAL SEC Filings filed before the date hereof, for
all Taxes that accrued on or before the end of the most recent period covered
by its NAL SEC Filings filed before the date hereof. 

   

(9) As of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any reason to believe that any conditions exist that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

(10) No Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any of its assets or
properties or those of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable. 

   

(11) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to
any distribution occurring prior to the date of this Agreement in which the
parties to such distribution treated the distribution as one to which Section
355 of the Code applied, except for distributions occurring among members of
the same group of affiliated corporations filing a consolidated federal
income tax return. 

   

(12) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
closing agreements, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda or
similar agreement or rulings have been entered into or issued by any taxing
authorities. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(13) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has ever been a member of
an affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary Tax group for purposes of
filing any Tax Return, other than, for purposes of filing
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Returns, a group of which
NAL was the common parent, (B) has any liability for Taxes of any person
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), or (C) is a party to or bound by any Tax

obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to Taxes. 

   

(14) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in any
"reportable transactions" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(1), and neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
"material advisor" to any such transaction within the meaning of Section
6111(b)(1) of the Code. 

   

(n) _Books and Records_. Its books and records and those of its
Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained, and there
are no inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained or reflected
therein. 

   

(o) _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. It has taken all action required to be
taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby from, and this Agreement and the transactions

nor is any affiliate of any of them, subject to a "statutory
disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act or

on the activities, functions or operations of, or suspension or revocation of
the registration of any broker-dealer Subsidiary as a broker-dealer,
municipal securities dealer, government securities broker or government
securities dealer under Section 15, Section 15B or Section 15C of the
Exchange Act, or performing similar functions under the Laws of other

notice of investigation by any Governmental Authority, whether preliminary

limitation, suspension or revocation. It has made available to FNFG true and
correct copies of the current Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer
Registration on Form BD for Advisory Entity, which is in compliance with

(x) _Accounting and Internal Controls_. 

   

(1) The records, systems, controls, data and information of it and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. It and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. It has
designed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the
meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. 

   

(2) NALs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. It has Previously Disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of the NAL
Board: (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) Since December 31, 2007, (A) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to its knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of it or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that it or any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (B) no attorney representing it or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by it or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its
board of directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors
or officers. 

   

(y) _Derivatives_. All swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures
and forward contracts and other similar derivative transactions (each, a "
_Derivative Contract_ "), whether entered into for its own account, or for
the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their respective customers,
were entered into (1) in accordance with prudent business practices and all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies and (2) with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and each
Derivative Contract constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of it
or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights or by general equity principles), and are in full force and effect.
Neither it nor its Subsidiaries, nor to its knowledge any other party thereto,
is in breach of any of its obligations under any Derivative Contract. The
financial position of NAL and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis under
or with respect to each such Derivative Contracts has been reflected in the
books and records of NAL and such Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied. 

   

(z) _Fiduciary Commitments and Duties_. It and each of its Subsidiaries
is empowered and authorized under applicable law to exercise all trust powers
necessary to conduct its business. It and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance
with the terms of the governing documents and applicable laws and regulations
(including ERISA and all orders, agreements, trusts, wills,
contracts, appointments, indentures, plans, arrangements, instruments and
common law standards). Neither it nor its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees, has committed
any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account.

Loans in excess of $1 million with any director, executive officer or five
percent or greater stockholder of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or to its
knowledge, any affiliate of any of the foregoing. It has Previously Disclosed

Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful,"
"Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans,"
"Watch List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount
of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the
borrower thereunder, (Y) by category of Loan ( _i_. _e_., commercial,
consumer, etc.), all of the other Loans of it and its Subsidiaries that, as
of June 30, 2010, were classified as such, together with the aggregate
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans by
category, and (Z) each asset of it or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of
June 30, 2010, was classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" and the book value
thereof, it being understood and agreed that the Loans referenced in clauses
(X) and (Y) of this sentence include any Loans so classified by
any Governmental Authority. NAL shall provide, on a monthly basis, a schedule
of Loans that become classified in the manner described in the previous
sentence, or any Loan the classification of which is changed to a lower
classification or to "Other Real Estate Owned," after the date of this
Agreement. 

   

(2) Each Loan in current principal amount in excess of $1 million (A)
is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (B) to the extent carried on the
books and records as secured Loans, has been secured by valid Liens which
have been perfected and (C) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles. 

   

(3) There are no outstanding Loans made by NAL or any of its Subsidiaries
to any "executive officer" or other "insider" (as each such term is defined
in Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal System)
of NAL or its Subsidiaries, other than loans that are subject to and that
were made and continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are
exempt therefrom.

(bb) _Financial Advisors, Etc._ None of it, its Subsidiaries or any of
their officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except that, in
connection with this Agreement, NAL has retained JPMorgan Securities, Inc. as
its financial advisor, and a true and complete copy of its arrangements with
JPMorgan Securities, Inc. has been disclosed to FNFG prior to the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, NAL has received the written opinion of
JPMorgan Securities, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion,

NAL Common Stock, and a true and complete copy of such opinion has been
delivered to FNFG.

other affiliate of NAL, on the other hand, except those of a type available
to employees of NAL generally. 

   

(dd) _Reorganization Treatment_. As of the date hereof, neither it nor any

Merger Subs valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and

rights or by general equity principles). 

   

(2) The FNFG Board has (A) unanimously approved this Agreement, the Merger,
the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved

    ##### 

  

   

(h) _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against or affecting it or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries (but including Merger Sub) (and it is not aware
of any basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that involves a
Governmental Authority, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, is (A)

Subs obligations under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement. There is no injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement,
decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by it, any of

any of them is threatened; 

   

(3) has received, since January 1, 2008, no written or, to its knowledge,

any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations, rules or ordinances which such Governmental Authority enforces;

Governmental Authority against either of it or any of its Subsidiaries or any
director, officer or employee thereof; and 

   

(5) has no reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist that
would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (A) to be operating or
to have operated in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act,
any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation or any
rule or regulation issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of
Foreign Assets Control; (B) not to be in compliance with the applicable
privacy and customer information requirements contained in any applicable
law; or (C) to be operating or to have operated in violation of any fair

(k) _Material Contracts_. Except for those agreements and other documents
filed as exhibits or incorporated by reference to its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 or filed or incorporated in
any other FNFG SEC Filing filed since December 31, 2009 and prior to the date
hereof or as Previously Disclosed, neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary is a
party to or subject to: (i) any collective bargaining agreement with any
labor union relating to employees of FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary, (ii) any
agreement which by its terms limits the payment of dividends by FNFG or any
FNFG Subsidiary or (iii) any "material contract" within the meaning of Item
601(b)(10) of the SECs Regulation S-K. 

   

(l) _FNFG Benefit Arrangements_. 

   

(1) All FNFG Benefit Arrangements are Previously Disclosed. True and
complete copies of all FNFG Benefit Arrangements, including any trust
instruments and insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock
ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any FNFG Benefit
Arrangements, and all amendments thereto have been made available to NAL. 

   

(2) All FNFG Benefit Arrangements, other than Multiemployer Plans, are
in substantial compliance, in form and operation, with their terms and ERISA,
the Code and other applicable laws (including with respect to non-
discrimination requirements, fiduciary duties and required regulatory
filings). Each FNFG Benefit Arrangement that is a Pension Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes
prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within
the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code,
and FNFG is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in the
loss of the qualification of any such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code. Neither FNFG nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject FNFG or any
Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither FNFG
nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax
or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
liability under Section 4071 of ERISA. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by it or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them or the single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates. It and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal
liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV
of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA
Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not been waived or
extended has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA
Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will
be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent to participants
and beneficiaries or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Section
302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

   

(4) All contributions required to be made under each FNFG Benefit
Arrangement, as of the date hereof, have been timely made or have been
reflected in the consolidated financial statements filed with the FNFG SEC
Filings. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file
information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most
recently completed plan year. No Pension Plan is in "at risk" status within
the meaning of Section 303 of ERISA. 

   

(5) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then-current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding
method, of such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan

(n) _Books and Records_. Its books and records and those of its
Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained, and there
are no inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained or reflected
therein. 

   

(o) _Reports_. Since January 1, 2008, FNFG and each of its Subsidiaries

to the date hereof by it and its Subsidiaries. 

   

(2) Except as Previously Disclosed, no current or former officer or director

    ##### 

  

   

(q) _Insurance_. It and each of its Subsidiaries maintain adequate
insurance coverage for all normal risks incident to the respective businesses

(r) _Accounting and Internal Controls_. 

   

(1) The records, systems, controls, data and information of it and

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. It and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. It has
designed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the
meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. 

   

(2) FNFGs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. It has Previously Disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of the FNFG
Board: (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in its internal controls over financial reporting. 

   

(3) Since December 31, 2007, (A) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to its knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of it or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that it or any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (B) no attorney representing it or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by it or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to its
board of directors or any committee thereof or to any of its directors or
officers. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(s) _Derivatives_. All Derivative Contracts, whether entered into for its
own account, or for the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their
respective customers, were entered into (1) in accordance with prudent
business practices and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies and (2) with counterparties believed to be financially responsible
at the time; and each Derivative Contract constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of it or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles), and are in full
force and effect. Neither it nor its Subsidiaries, nor to its knowledge any
other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any
Derivative Contract. The financial position of FNFG and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis under or with respect to each such Derivative
Contracts has been reflected in the books and records of FNFG and such
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. 

   

(t) _Financial Advisors, Etc._ None of it, its Subsidiaries or any of
their officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except that, in
connection with this Agreement, FNFG has retained Sandler ONeill and Partners,
L.P. as its financial advisor. As of the date hereof, FNFG has received the
written opinion of Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. to the effect that, as
of the date of the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid by FNFG to
the stockholders of NAL is fair from a financial point of view to FNFG, and a
true and complete copy of such opinion has been delivered to NAL. 

   

(u) _Reorganization Treatment_. As of the date hereof, neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that any conditions exist that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger or the Bank
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. 

   

(v) _Aggregate Cash Consideration_. FNFG will have available to it, as of
the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate cash payments

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE VI 

   

COVENANTS 

   

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of FNFG, Merger Sub and NAL will use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable
under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly
as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with the other parties to
that end. 

   

6.02 _Stockholder Approvals_. 

   

(a) The NAL Board will submit to its stockholders this Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved or adopted by such stockholders in order to
carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that
obligation, NAL will take, in accordance with applicable law and its
Governing Documents, all action necessary or appropriate to convene a meeting
of its holders of NAL Common Stock (including any adjournment or postponement,
the " _NAL Meeting_ "), as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective, to consider and vote upon adoption of this
Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken. NAL and the NAL Board will use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the votes in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by the DGCL, including by
recommending that its stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement, and NAL
and the NAL Board will not withdraw, qualify or adversely modify (or publicly
propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or adversely modify) the NAL
Recommendation to the NAL stockholders (an " _Adverse Recommendation_ ").
However, if, prior to the time the NAL Requisite Vote is obtained, the NAL
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith
that, because of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the NAL Board
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would result in
a violation of its fiduciary duties under the DGCL to continue to recommend
this Agreement to its stockholders in light of such Acquisition Proposal,
then, in submitting this Agreement at the NAL Meeting, the NAL Board may do
one or more of the following: (1) submit this Agreement without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting the NAL
Recommendation prior to the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the NAL Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the stockholders in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; or
(2) make an Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make an
Adverse Recommendation; _provided_ that the NAL Board may not take any
particular action described in clauses (1) or (2) of this sentence without
(X) giving FNFG prior written notice of the proposed action (which notice
shall also include notice of the Acquisition Proposal and the latest terms
and conditions of and the identity of the person(s) making the Acquisition
Proposal) and (Y) giving FNFG five (5) business days to respond to
such Acquisition Proposal. In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation in response to any Acquisition Proposal, the NAL Board will
take into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
FNFG in response thereto as well as any other information provided by FNFG.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a
new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.02(a). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) The FNFG Board will submit to its stockholders the matters required to be
approved or adopted by such stockholders in order to carry out the intentions
of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, FNFG will take, in
accordance with applicable law and its Governing Documents, all action
necessary or appropriate to convene a meeting of its holders of FNFG Common
Stock (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _FNFG Meeting_ "), as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective, to consider and vote upon the approval of the FNFG Stock
Issuance and to cause such vote to be taken. FNFG and the FNFG Board will use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the votes in
favor of the FNFG Stock Issuance required by the rules of the NASDAQ,
including by recommending that its stockholders vote in favor of
such issuance, and FNFG and the FNFG Board will not withdraw, qualify or
adversely modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or
adversely modify) the FNFG Recommendation to the FNFG stockholders. However,
if, prior to the time the FNFG Requisite Vote is obtained, the FNFG Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith that it
would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under the DGCL
to continue to recommend the FNFG Stock Issuance, then, in submitting the
FNFG Stock Issuance at the FNFG Meeting, the FNFG Board may do one or more of
the following: (1) submit the FNFG Stock Issuance without recommendation
(although the resolutions adopting the FNFG Recommendation prior to the date
hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the FNFG Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the stockholders
in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by law; or (2) withdraw, qualify or adversely
modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or adversely
modify) the FNFG Recommendation to the FNFG stockholders. 

   

(c) The parties shall cooperate to schedule and convene the NAL Meeting and
the FNFG Meeting on the same date. 

   

6.03 _SEC Filings_. 

   

(a) FNFG and NAL will cooperate in ensuring that all required SEC filings are
timely and properly made. FNFG will prepare a registration statement on Form
S-4 or other applicable form (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be filed
by FNFG with the SEC in connection with the FNFG Stock Issuance, and the
parties will jointly prepare the proxy statement and prospectus and other
proxy solicitation materials of NAL to be filed with the SEC and included in
the Registration Statement (the " _Joint Proxy/Prospectus_ "), as well as any
other related documents. Each party will cooperate, and will cause
its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other party, its counsel and its
accountants, in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus, and FNFG and NAL will file the Registration Statement,
including the Joint Proxy/Prospectus in preliminary form, with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable. After filing the Registration Statement,
the parties will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable, and, upon the Registration Statement being declared effective,
the parties will mail the Joint Proxy/Prospectus to their respective
stockholders as promptly as practicable thereafter. The parties will use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement until the Effective Time. Each party shall cooperate and
provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and each party will
provide the other party with a copy of all such filings with the SEC. FNFG
also agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry
out the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to furnish for
inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus all
information concerning it, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and
stockholders as may be required by applicable law in connection with the
foregoing. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) FNFG and NAL each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if
any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the
Joint Proxy/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the NAL Meeting and the
FNFG Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. FNFG and NAL each further agrees that if
it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to
take appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement. 

   

(c) FNFG will advise NAL, promptly after FNFG receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
suspension of the qualification of FNFG Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or for
additional information. 

  

6.04 _Press Releases and Other Communications_. FNFG and NAL will consult with
each other before issuing any press release, written and broadly disseminated
employee communication, written stockholder communication or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is required to be filed
under applicable securities laws and will not issue any such release,
communication or other announcement or make any such public statement without
the prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release, communication or
other announcement or make such public statement as may be required by
applicable law or securities exchange rules. The parties shall provide to
each other any press release, written and broadly disseminated employee
communication, other written stockholder communication or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is not required to be filed
under applicable securities laws at or about the time such communication is
made. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

6.05 _Access; Information_. 

   

(a) Each of FNFG and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and NAL, on the other hand,
agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford the other party, and the other partys officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized Representatives, such access during normal
business hours throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books,
records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors),
properties, personnel and to such other information as the other party
may reasonably request and, during such period, it will furnish promptly to
such other party (1) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed
by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities or banking
laws, and (2) all other information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. None of FNFG, Merger Sub
or NAL or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be required to afford
access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client
privilege or contravene any provisions of applicable law or any binding
agreement with any third party. The parties will make appropriate substitute
arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence applies. 

   

(b) Each party will hold any information that is nonpublic and confidential
in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. 

   

(c) No investigation by any party of the business and affairs of the other
party, pursuant to this Section 6.05 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed
to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, or the conditions to any partys obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

6.06 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

(a) NAL will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries officers and directors not to and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents, advisors and
other Representatives and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that in the event, prior to the time the
NAL Requisite Vote is obtained but not after, (1) NAL receives, after the
execution of this Agreement, an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
from a person other than FNFG, and (2) the NAL Board concludes in good faith
(A) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) that, after
considering the advice of outside counsel, failure to take such actions would
result in a violation of the directors fiduciary duties under the DGCL, NAL
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information
or data and participate in negotiations or discussions with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it
shall have entered into an agreement with such third party on terms
substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(except that NAL may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a
standstill provision or with a standstill provision less favorable to NAL if
and only if it first waives or similarly modifies the standstill provision in
the Confidentiality Agreement). NAL will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than FNFG with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal. NAL
will promptly (within one business day) advise FNFG following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep FNFG apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis. 

   

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent NAL or the NAL Board
from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or
other disclosure requirements under applicable law or the NYSE or the NASDAQ
rules, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such rules
will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to
such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

   

6.07 [RESERVED]. 

  

6.08 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party will take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect. No party will take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and
each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to make
those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover
Provisions. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

6.09 _Exchange Listing and De-Listing_. FNFG will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of FNFG Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and
shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof to be approved
for quotation on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time. Prior to
the Closing Date, NAL will cooperate with FNFG and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by
the Surviving Entity of the NAL Common Stock from the NYSE and the
deregistration of the NAL Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. 

   

6.10 _Regulatory Applications_. 

   

(a) FNFG and NAL and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use
all reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ ") and will make all necessary filings in respect of those
Requisite Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable. Each of FNFG, Merger
Sub and NAL will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
substantive written information submitted to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other party with
respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party
will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

(b) FNFG and NAL will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

   

6.11 _Indemnification_. 

   

(a) Following the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, FNFG
will: (1) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of NAL and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts as incurred, in connection with any claim, action (whether
threatened, pending or contemplated), suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether arising before or after the Effective Time and whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or actions or omissions occurring at or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall advance expenses as incurred, _provided_  the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification; (2) honor any existing, Previously
Disclosed agreements relating to indemnity; and (3) for six years after the
Effective Time, maintain in effect provisions in the Surviving Entitys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such document of any successor
to the business of the Surviving Entity) regarding elimination of liability
of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
their intended beneficiaries than the provisions set forth in _Annex 1_. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, NAL shall, or, if NAL is unable to, FNFG
shall, as of the Effective Time obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for the present
and former officers and directors of NAL or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Such "tail" insurance policy will contain
coverage, amounts, terms and conditions, no less advantageous to such
officers and directors than the coverage currently provided by NAL. If NAL
(or FNFG) for any reason cannot obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, FNFG shall obtain comparable insurance for such six-
year period with coverage, amounts, terms and conditions no less advantageous
to such officers and directors than the coverage currently provided by NAL.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.11, in no case will FNFG be
obligated to make annual premium payments for any such "tail" insurance or
comparable insurance policies to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the
premiums paid as of the date hereof by NAL for such insurance (" _NAL s
Current Premium_"); if any such premiums at any time exceed 250% of NALs
Current Premium, then FNFG will cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in FNFGs good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 250% of NALs Current Premium. 

   

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify FNFG; _provided_ that
failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of FNFG under Section
6.11(a) except to the extent that FNFG is actually prejudiced as a
consequence. 

   

(d) If FNFG or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets
to any other entity, then and in each case, FNFG will cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of FNFG will assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. 

   

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

6.12 _Benefit Plans_. 

   

(a) From the Effective Time, FNFG shall provide the employees of NAL and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements that are substantially similar to those provided to
similarly situated employees of FNFG and its Subsidiaries. 

   

(b) FNFG shall (1) provide all Covered Employees with service credit for
purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), under any employee benefit
or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or
contributed to by FNFG or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees
are eligible to participate, for all actual periods of employment with NAL or
any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) prior to the
Effective Time, (2) cause any pre-existing conditions, limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any
welfare benefit plans of FNFG or any of its Subsidiaries to be waived with
respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent
waived under the corresponding plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in
which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (3) give credit for deductibles and eligible out-of-
pocket expenses incurred (upon receipt of necessary documentation) towards
deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs, and (4) give credit for accrued vacation and
sick days during the period commencing on the beginning of the year in which
the Effective Time occurs until the Effective Time, as provided under the
NAL Benefit Arrangements under the FNFG Benefit Arrangements for the year in
which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 6.12, this Section 6.12(b) shall not apply with respect to the FNFG
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

   

(c) NAL shall terminate the NAL Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_
") immediately prior to the Effective Time. In conjunction with such
termination, all unallocated shares held as collateral pursuant to the ESOP
necessary to retire the ESOPs debt will be converted into treasury shares of
NAL, and NAL will take all necessary actions to extinguish the balance (if
any) of any ESOP loans outstanding as of the Closing Date. The accounts of
all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP shall become fully vested upon
termination of the ESOP. In the event of such termination of the ESOP, then as
soon as practicable following the receipt of an IRS favorable determination
letter in relation to the termination of the ESOP, the account balances in
the ESOP shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or
transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. 

   

(d) If requested by FNFG in writing, NAL shall cause the NAL 401(k) Savings
Plan (the " _NAL Plan_ ") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the
Closing Date. In the event of such termination of the NAL Plan, then as soon
as administratively practicable following the receipt of an IRS favorable
determination letter in relation to the termination of the NAL Plan from NAL,
the account balances of all participants and beneficiaries in the NAL Plan
shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred
to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement
account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. FNFG agrees to permit
Covered Employees to roll over their account balances in the NAL Plan to the
FNFG 401(k) Plan. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, NAL shall take all necessary
actions to cease any additional benefit accruals pursuant to the Employees
Retirement Plan of NAL. 

   

(f) FNFG and NAL may wish to provide retention bonuses to employees of NAL who
remain employed at NAL through the Effective Time, or at FNFG for an interim
period following the Effective Time through conversion. FNFG and NAL will
mutually agree as to each NAL employee eligible to receive a retention bonus
and the amount of each such retention bonus. The aggregate amount of such
retention bonuses may be up to $2 million. 

   

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, NAL shall amend Section 6.01 of the NAL
Severance Plan (the " _Severance Plan_ ") to provide that in the event of a
change in control (as defined in the Severance Plan), the Severance Plan may
not be terminated or amended to reduce the benefits provided under the
Severance Plan for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date, except as set
forth in Section 8.08 of the Severance Plan, and except that any NAL employee
whose employment terminates within 12 months after the Closing Date and who
is entitled to receive benefits under the Severance Plan shall receive
benefits under the Severance Plan as in effect as of the date of any such
employees termination of employment. 

   

(h) FNFG agrees to provide outplacement services to eligible Covered Employees
who are terminated by FNFG or its affiliates following the Merger due to
relocation or consolidation of operations in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the FNFG Benefit Arrangements. 

   

(i) Except as Previously Disclosed, FNFG agrees to honor the terms of all NAL
Benefit Arrangements Previously Disclosed, with certain of the payments under
such Benefit Arrangements to be accelerated as Previously Disclosed. FNFG
agrees that completion of the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control"
for purposes of the NAL Benefit Arrangements. 

  

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. FNFG and NAL will give prompt notice
to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (1) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII. 

  

6.14 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof,
NAL will furnish to FNFG (a) consolidated and consolidating
financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders equity) of NAL and each of its Subsidiaries as of and for such
month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports showing
actual financial performance against plan and previous period, (c)
any reports provided to the NAL Board or any committee thereof relating to
the financial performance and risk management of NAL or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (d) information regarding Loans in accordance with
a template to be mutually agreed to by the parties. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

6.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of NAL Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of NAL Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

6.16 _FNFG Board; Regional Matters_. 

   

(a) _FNFG Board_. FNFG will increase the size of the FNFG Board and fill
the vacancies created by such increase by appointing three current directors
of NAL, selected in consultation with the NAL Board, to the FNFG Board as of
the Effective Time. One of the NAL directors so appointed will also be
appointed to the FNFG Boards Executive Committee. 

   

(b) _Regional Advisory Board_. As promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time, FNFG will invite all members of the NAL Board as of the
date of this Agreement (other than those members who are elected to the FNFG
Board) to serve as paid members of a regional advisory board, the function of
which will be to advise First Niagara Bank with respect to deposit and
lending activities in NewAlliance Banks former market area and to maintain
and develop customer relationships. 

   

(c) _Regional Market Center_. FNFG agrees to name the location at 195
Church Street to be the location of FNFGs regional market center as of the
Effective Time. 

  

6.17 _Charitable Donation_. Following the Closing, FNFG will make a donation
of $7,500,000 to the FNFG Foundation in order to support the market areas
served by NewAlliance Bank prior to the date of this Agreement.

breaching party not to consummate the Merger under Article VII and such
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of
written notice to the breaching party of such breach. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Adverse Action_. 

   

(1) By FNFG, if (A) the NAL Board submits this Agreement to its
stockholders without a recommendation for approval or the NAL
Board otherwise makes an Adverse Recommendation (or publicly proposes or
resolves to make an Adverse Recommendation); (B) the NAL Board recommends (or
discloses its intention to recommend) to its stockholders an Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger; or (C) the NAL Board commences to negotiate
or authorizes the conduct of negotiations with a third party (it being
understood and agreed that "negotiate" shall not be deemed to include the
provision of information to, or the request and receipt of information from,
any person that submits an Acquisition Proposal or discussions regarding such
information for the sole purpose of ascertaining or clarifying the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal and determining whether the NAL Board will in fact
engage in, or authorize, negotiations) regarding an Acquisition Proposal
other than the Merger. 

   

(2) By NAL, if (A) (i) the FNFG Board submits the FNFG Stock Issuance to
its stockholders without a recommendation for approval or (ii) the FNFG Board

Issuance. 

   

(d) _Delay_. If the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of business
on June 30, 2011; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
cause of, or materially contributed to, the failure of the Effective Time to
occur on or before such date. 

   

(e) _Denial of Regulatory Approval_. If the approval of any

(ii) the product obtained by multiplying the Index Ratio by the Initial FNFG
Market Value. If within such five business day period, FNFG delivers written
notice to NAL that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such
additional consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.01(f), and this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms

9.09 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
represents the entire understanding of FNFG, NAL and Merger Sub regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all other oral or
written agreements previously made or purported to be made, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement; _provided_ that it will not impair the rights of FNFG to make
a response or propose amendments or modifications as contemplated by the
final proviso to Section 6.02(a). No representation, warranty, inducement,
promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or relied on by any party in entering into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding Section 9.01 or any other provision hereof (other than
Section 6.11, which is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties to the
extent stated), nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any person other
than FNFG, NAL and Merger Sub. 

  

9.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of FNFG or NAL)
or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the application
of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it
has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect
and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith in an effort
to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the parties hereto. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the absence of a vote, approval or
adoption by the stockholders of NAL will not render invalid or inoperative
any provision hereof not specifically required to be contained in a plan of
merger to be adopted by such stockholders pursuant to the DGCL. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

9.11 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties may
mutually agree to revise the structure of the Merger and related
transactions, _provided_ that each of the transactions comprising the revised
structure (1) does not change the amount or form of consideration to be
received by the stockholders of NAL and the holders of NAL Stock Options, (2)
does not adversely affect the tax consequences to the stockholders of NAL,
(3) is reasonably capable of consummation in as timely a manner as the
structure contemplated herein, (4) does not, and is not reasonably likely to,
otherwise cause the conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c) to
not be capable of being fulfilled and (5) is not otherwise prejudicial to the
interests of the stockholders of either NAL or FNFG. This Agreement and
any related documents will be appropriately amended in order to reflect any
such revised structure.

NINTH. 

  

    A.  |   | Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to
be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding
is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee
or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, except as provided in Section C of this Article NINTH with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation.  
---|---|--- 
    

 

    ##### 

  

  

    

  

    B.  |   | The right to indemnification conferred in Section A of
this Article NINTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, services to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of
such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under Section B of this Article
NINTH or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses conferred in Sections A and B of this Article NINTH shall be
contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    C.  |   | If a claim under Section A or B of this Article NINTH is
not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written
claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for
an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be
twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in
whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting
or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce
a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation
Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article
NINTH or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.  
---|---|--- 
   

 

    ##### 

  

  

    

  

    D.  |   | The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses conferred in this Article NINTH shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the
Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, by-laws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or otherwise.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    E.  |   | The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or subsidiary or affiliate or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware
General Corporation Law.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    F.  |   | The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article NINTH with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    G.  |   | Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Article NINTH, in no event shall any payments made by the Corporation
pursuant to this Article NINTH exceed the amount permissible under applicable
state or federal law, including but not limited to the limitations
on indemnification imposed by Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act and the regulation issued thereunder by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.
