Exchange Agent is notified in writing by FNFG or NAL, upon exercise by FNFG or NAL of its
respective or their mutual rights to terminate this Agreement to the extent provided under

required to be approved or adopted by such stockholders in order to carry out the intentions
of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, NAL will take, in accordance with
applicable law and its Governing Documents, all action necessary or appropriate to convene a
meeting of its holders of NAL Common Stock (including any adjournment or postponement, the
&#147;<U>NAL Meeting</U>&#148;), as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective, to consider and vote upon adoption of this Agreement and to cause such
vote to be taken. NAL and the NAL Board will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its stockholders the votes in favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by the
DGCL, including by recommending that its stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement, and
NAL and the NAL Board will not withdraw, qualify or adversely modify (or publicly propose or

stockholders (an &#147;<U>Adverse Recommendation</U>&#148;). However, if, prior to the time the NAL
Requisite Vote is obtained, the NAL Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
determines in good faith that, because of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the
NAL Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under the DGCL to continue to recommend this Agreement to
its stockholders in light of such Acquisition Proposal, then, in submitting this Agreement
at the NAL Meeting, the NAL Board may do one or more of the following: (1)&nbsp;submit this
Agreement without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting the NAL Recommendation
prior to the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the NAL Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the stockholders in the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
law; or (2)&nbsp;make an Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make an Adverse
Recommendation; <U>provided</U> that the NAL Board may not take any particular action
described in clauses (1)&nbsp;or (2)&nbsp;of this sentence without (X)&nbsp;giving FNFG prior written
notice of the proposed action (which notice shall also include notice of the Acquisition
Proposal and the latest terms and conditions of and the identity of the person(s) making the
Acquisition Proposal) and (Y)&nbsp;giving FNFG five (5)&nbsp;business days to respond to such
Acquisition Proposal. In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation in response
to any Acquisition Proposal, the NAL Board will take into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by FNFG in response thereto as well as any other
information provided by
FNFG. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section&nbsp;6.02(a).

director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a

alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all expense, liability

therewith; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, except as provided in Section&nbsp;C of this
Article&nbsp;NINTH with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the

    <TD>The right to indemnification conferred in Section&nbsp;A of this Article&nbsp;NINTH shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in

<U>however</U>, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of
expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in
any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without
limitation, services to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an &#147;undertaking&#148;), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a &#147;final
adjudication&#148;) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
Section&nbsp;B of this Article&nbsp;NINTH or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in Sections&nbsp;A and B of this Article&nbsp;NINTH shall be contract
rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee&#146;s heirs, executors

    <TD>If a claim under Section&nbsp;A or B of this Article&nbsp;NINTH is not paid in full by the Corporation
within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in
the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall
be twenty (20)&nbsp;days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in
any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expenses of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i)&nbsp;any suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii)&nbsp;in any
suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the
indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit
brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article&nbsp;NINTH or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.</TD>
