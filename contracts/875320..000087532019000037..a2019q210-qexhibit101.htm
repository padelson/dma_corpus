Stock for which a valid Section 83(b) election under the Code has not been

Holders at the time of such distribution solely to the extent necessary to
ensure that each Company Holder is bearing, as of immediately after giving

of such reallocation is set forth on Section 2.7.4 of the Disclosure Schedule.

(a)

|

an amount in cash at Closing equal to the excess, if any, of the Closing
Payment allocated to such Vested Company Stock Option on Schedule I over the
aggregate exercise of such Vested Company Stock Option, less any applicable
withholding Taxes thereon and any applicable withholding Taxes in respect of
the portion of the Shareholders' Representative Reserve allocable to such
Vested Company Stock Option; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

subject to the terms of Section 2.7.4, the amounts, if any, that may become

such Company Restricted Stock in connection with the Merger set forth in

adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any
required consents, but not including the payment of any cash or non-cash
consideration without Buyer's prior written consent) as may be required to
effect the transactions described in this Section 2.8 as of the Effective
Time. No later than four Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide copies of any such resolutions or other written
communications or documents relating to the foregoing for Buyer's review and
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Company
shall terminate the Company Stock Plan and all rights thereunder as of the
Effective Time without Liability to Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates),
other than, with respect to Vested Company Stock Options, the obligation to
make the payments required by Section 2.8.1 and with respect to Company
Restricted Stock, the obligation to make the payments required by the terms of

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in
any event, no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement),
Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to provide to each holder of a Certificate

and the Paying Agent (a "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use
of the Letter of Transmittal in effecting the surrender of such Certificate in
exchange for the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section
2.7.3 with respect to each of the shares of Company Capital Stock represented
thereby. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with
such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and a properly executed Form W-9 or appropriate Form W-8
(including any required attachments or schedules thereto), as applicable, from
such holder in form and substance acceptable to the Paying Agent, the Paying
Agent shall pay promptly, by electronic check (ACH), to the holder of such
Certificate the cash payment described in Section 2.7.3(a) (rounded up to the
nearest $0.01) into which the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by
such Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.7.3, without any
interest thereon, provided, however, that (A) any such Certificates and
Letters of Transmittal delivered to the Paying Agent prior to the Closing
shall be held in escrow by the Paying Agent, pending the consummation of the
Closing, and shall be deemed to be surrendered upon the Closing, subject to
the satisfaction of the instructions provided to such holder for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates, (B) with respect to any Deferred Holder, the
Paying Agent shall not pay to such holder any portion of Merger Consideration
that is Deferred Consideration until the satisfaction of the applicable terms
and conditions set forth in (1) with respect to the [ * ], the [ * ] Deferred
Consideration Agreement, (2) with respect to any Designated Individual, such
Designated Individual's Designated Individual Agreement or (3) with respect to
any Deferred Holder that is not the [ * ] or a Designated Individual, in
accordance with Schedule I and (C) payments in respect of shares of Company
Restricted Stock for which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code
has not been shall be made through the Surviving Corporation's payroll and not
by the Paying Agent. The Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, such Certificates shall upon and following the
Effective Time represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock, without interest. Except
as set forth in Section 2.10.2, no holder of a Certificate will be entitled to
be paid any Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have
complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.10.1, including due
execution and delivery to the Paying Agent of the Letter of Transmittal by
such holder of such Certificate, which constitutes an integral component of
and limitation on the Merger Consideration. 

| 
---|--- 

2.10.2.

|

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, Buyer shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares
of Company Capital Stock represented thereby to be paid (by the Paying Agent)
in accordance with Section 2.7.3 and as contemplated under this ARTICLE 2;
provided, however, that Buyer may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver an indemnification agreement as it
may reasonably require with respect to any claim that may be made against
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person
submitting such affidavit to the Paying Agent shall be liable under ARTICLE 8
to Buyer for any Losses resulting from any inaccuracies in the affidavit. 

| 
---|--- 

2.10.3.

|

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in
any event, no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement),
the Company shall provide to each holder of a Company Stock Option an option
cancellation agreement in a form mutually agreed upon between the Parties (an
"Option Cancellation Agreement"). Promptly following the receipt by the Paying
Agent of an Option Cancellation Agreement duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the applicable portion of the Option
Merger Consideration as set forth on Schedule I shall (i) first be paid by the
Buyer to the Company and then shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to
such holder of such Vested Company Stock Option or (ii) for holders of Vested
Company Stock Options who are not current or former employees of the Company,
paid by the Paying Agent directly to such holder, in each case of clauses (i)
and (ii), in accordance with Section 2.8, provided, however, that any such
Option Cancellation Agreement delivered to the Paying Agent prior to the
Closing shall be held in escrow by the Paying Agent, pending the consummation
of the Closing, and shall be deemed to be delivered upon the Closing, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in such Option Cancellation Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no holder of
Company Stock Options will be entitled to be paid any Option Merger
Consideration unless and until such holder shall have complied with the
requirements set forth in Section 2.10.3, including due execution and delivery
to the Paying Agent by such holder of the Option Cancellation Agreement, which
constitutes an integral component of and limitation on the Option Merger
Consideration.

Representative") with respect to any and all matters relating to, arising out
of, or in connection with, this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto,
including for purposes of taking any action or omitting to take any action on

|

receive service of process in connection with any claims under this Agreement; 

| 
---|---

(h)

|

agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises and/or comply with
awards and court orders with respect to claims for indemnification; and 

All actions, notices, communications and determinations by or on behalf of
Company Holders shall be given or made by the Shareholders' Representative and
all such actions, notices, communications and determinations by the
Shareholders' Representative shall conclusively be deemed to have been
authorized by, and shall be binding upon, any of and all Company Holders, and
no Company Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. All decisions and actions of the Shareholders'
Representative on behalf of the Company Holders shall be deemed to be facts
ascertainable outside of this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

2.11.2.

|

The Shareholders' Representative may resign at any time. If the Shareholders'
Representative becomes unable to perform its responsibilities hereunder or
resigns, then holders of a majority of the Company Capital Stock, based on
their Pro Rata Percentage, promptly shall designate in writing to Buyer a
single individual to fill the Shareholders' Representative vacancy as the
successor Shareholders' Representative hereunder. If at any time there shall
not be a Shareholders' Representative or Company Holders fail to designate a
successor Shareholders' Representative, then Buyer may have a court of
competent jurisdiction appoint a Shareholders' Representative hereunder.
Holders of a majority of the Company Capital Stock, based on their Pro Rata
Percentage, may also replace the Person serving as the Shareholders'
Representative from time to time and for any reason upon at least ten days'
prior written notice to Buyer. The Shareholders' Representative may be removed
only upon delivery of written notice to the Buyer signed by Persons who, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, held a majority (by voting power) of
the then outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock. 

| 
---|--- 

2.11.3.

|

The Shareholders' Representative shall act for Company Holders on all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Shareholders'
Representative believes to be in the best interest of Company Holders. The
Shareholders' Representative is authorized to act on behalf of Company Holders
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among Company Holders. In taking
any actions as Shareholders' Representative, the Shareholders' Representative
may rely conclusively, without any further inquiry or investigation, upon any
certification or confirmation, oral or written, given by any Person the
Shareholders' Representative reasonably believes to be authorized thereunto.
The Shareholders' Representative will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Shareholders' Representative in
connection with the Shareholders' Representative's services pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Shareholders' Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders' Representative shall not
be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Company Holders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with the
Shareholders' Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Shareholders' Representative, the
Shareholders' Representative will reimburse the Company Holders the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct; provided, further, that in no event shall a
Company Holder be liable under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection therewith for any
Representative Losses in excess of the Merger Consideration and Option Merger
Consideration actually paid, or that becomes due and payable in accordance
with Section 2.14, to him, her or it. If not paid directly to the
Shareholders' Representative by the Company Holders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Shareholders' Representative from (i) the funds
in the Shareholders' Representative Reserve, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow Fund
and the Indemnification Escrow Fund, in each case at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Holders and (iii) any
future Contingent Payments that become due and payable in accordance with
Section 2.14; provided, that while this section allows the Shareholders'
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Company Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Shareholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Shareholders' Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Holders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Company Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders' Representative
under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Shareholders' Representative or the termination
of this Agreement. 

|

2.11.4.

|

The Shareholders' Representative shall treat confidentially any Confidential
Information of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation disclosed to it pursuant
to this Agreement and shall not use such Confidential Information other than
in the performance of its duties as the Shareholders' Representative. In
addition, the Shareholders' Representative shall not disclose any Confidential
Information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement to anyone except as
required by Applicable Law; provided that (i) the Shareholders' Representative
may disclose such Confidential Information to legal counsel, employees,
advisors, agents or consultants, in each case who have a need to know such
information, provided that such persons are subject to confidentiality
obligations with respect thereto no less restrictive than the obligations set
forth in Section 6.10 of this Agreement, (ii) the Shareholders' Representative
(or legal counsel, employees, advisors, agents or consultants to whom
Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to clause (i) above) may
disclose such Confidential Information in any Action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in either case,
discussion in preparation therefor) and (iii) the Shareholders' Representative
may disclose to any Company Holder any such Confidential Information disclosed
to the Shareholders' Representative subject to such Company Holder agreeing
with Buyer in writing to restrictions on the disclosure and use of such
Confidential Information consistent with or no less stringent than the
restrictions to which the Shareholders' Representative is subject pursuant to
this Section 2.11.4. 

| 
---|--- 

2.11.5.

|

Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the authority of the Shareholders'
Representative as the agent, representative and attorney-in-fact of Company
Holders for all purposes under this Agreement and shall have no Liability for
any such reliance. No Company Holder may revoke the authority of the
Shareholders' Representative. Each Company Holder, by signing a Written
Consent or otherwise voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger or by
surrendering or delivering a Certificate or an affidavit in lieu thereof to
the Paying Agent along with an executed Letter of Transmittal (with respect to
holders of Company Capital Stock) or by delivering an executed Option
Cancellation Agreement (with respect to holders of Company Stock Options), in
each case, in exchange for the consideration to be paid in accordance with
this Agreement, hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to ratify and
confirm, any action taken by the Shareholders' Representative in the exercise
of the power-of-attorney granted to the Shareholders' Representative pursuant
to this Section 2.11, which power-of-attorney, being coupled with an interest,
is irrevocable and shall survive the death, incapacity or incompetence of such
Company Holder. The provisions of this Section 2.11 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable (subject only to Section 2.11.2) and coupled with
an interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies
that any Company Holder may have in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

|

2.11.6.

|

At the Closing, the Paying Agent shall distribute the Shareholders'
Representative Reserve to the Shareholders' Representative, which shall be
maintained by the Shareholders' Representative in a segregated account for
paying directly or reimbursing the Shareholders' Representative for any third
party expenses in performing the obligations and exercising the rights of the
Shareholders' Representative hereunder or under any agreements ancillary
hereto. The Shareholders' Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Company Holders shall
not receive interest or other earnings on the Shareholders' Representative
Reserve and Company Holders irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Shareholders' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the Shareholders'
Representative Reserve. Company Holders acknowledge that the Shareholders'
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice. The Shareholders' Representative shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Shareholders' Representative
Reserve other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
For Tax purposes, the Shareholders' Representative Reserve shall be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by Company Holders at the time
of Closing. The Shareholders' Representative shall be reimbursed for out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) under this Agreement from the
Shareholders' Representative Reserve; provided that if the Shareholders'
Representative Reserve is insufficient to pay such expenses, then the
Shareholders' Representative shall be reimbursed directly from Company Holders
on a several basis (and not a joint and several basis) according to their Pro
Rata Percentage. Upon the determination of the Shareholders' Representative
that the Shareholders' Representative Reserve is no longer necessary in
connection with claims for indemnification of the Shareholders' Representative
pursuant to this Section 2.11, the Shareholders' Representative shall
distribute to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Holders
(solely out of the Shareholders' Representative Reserve) the amount remaining
in the Shareholders' Representative Reserve after payment of all of the
Shareholders' Representative's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with its services as Shareholders' Representative. The Shareholders'
Representative Reserve shall not be available to Buyer to satisfy any claims
hereunder. Any payments as may be required by the Shareholders' Representative
to be made directly to it by any Company Holders pursuant to this Agreement or
any other agreement shall be paid in accordance with such Company Holder's Pro
Rata Percentage.

2.11.7.

The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Holder, and any references in this Agreement to a
Company Holder shall mean and include the successors to the rights of each
applicable Company Holder hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

2.12.

Close of Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be outstanding, and the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by Applicable
Law.

2.13.

|

Working Capital Adjustment. 

| 
---|--- 

2.13.1.

|

The Closing Payment shall be adjusted by an amount (the "Closing Working
Capital Adjustment") equal to any Positive Working Capital Adjustment or any
Negative Working Capital Adjustment, as applicable, as set forth in this
Section 2.13.1. At least four Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide a statement that sets forth its good faith calculation
of the Working Capital of the Company as of the close of business on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (except that Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities
shall be determined as of the end of the day on the Closing Date) (the
"Estimated Closing Date Working Capital"), which shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP (except to the extent otherwise provided in the
definition of Working Capital), applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation, assumptions and estimates made or used in the preparation of the
Working Capital Exhibit. In the event the Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital is a negative amount, the Closing Payment shall be reduced by the
absolute value of such amount (the "Negative Working Capital Adjustment"). In
the event the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is a positive amount, the
Closing Payment shall be increased by an amount equal to the absolute value of
such amount (the "Positive Working Capital Adjustment"). Following Buyer's
receipt of the statement setting forth the Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital, the Company shall provide to Buyer and Merger Sub, and their
authorized representatives, reasonable access to all records used in preparing
such Estimated Closing Date Working Capital (and employees of the Company who
can adequately answer questions on the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital,
including such access to facilities as is reasonably necessary to have such
access to such employees) and, if applicable, the Company's outside
accountants and their work papers and other documents used in preparing such
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital. No later than [ * ] after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Shareholders' Representative a statement setting forth Buyer's good faith
calculation of the Working Capital of the Company as of the close of business
on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Buyer's Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation"), which shall be determined in accordance with
GAAP (except to the extent otherwise provided in the definition of Working
Capital), applied in a manner consistent with the preparation, assumptions and
estimates made or used in the preparation of the Working Capital Exhibit. 

| 
---|--- 

2.13.2.

|

If Buyer does not deliver the Buyer's Closing Date Working Capital Calculation
as set forth above, then the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be the Buyer's Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation. The Shareholders' Representative may provide a
written notice to Buyer of any disagreement with respect to the Buyer's
Closing Date Working Capital Calculation within [ * ] after delivery of
Buyer's Closing Date Working Capital Calculation to the Shareholders'
Representative. If the Shareholders' Representative provides such a notice,
the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer will attempt in good faith to
resolve such disagreement. If, within [ * ] after delivery to Buyer of such
notification by the Shareholders' Representative, they are unable to resolve
such disagreement, either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Shareholders'
Representative, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit the
determination of such matter to an accounting firm of nationally recognized
independent public accountants reasonably acceptable to each of Buyer and the
Shareholders' Representative, or, in the absence of mutual agreement, Deloitte
LLP (the "Auditor"). Each Party agrees to execute a reasonable engagement
letter, and all fees and expenses relating to the work performed by the
Auditor shall be shared equally between Buyer and the Shareholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders); provided, that if the
Auditor determines that either the Shareholders' Representative or the Buyer
has adopted a position or positions with respect to the Working Capital that
is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Auditor (a) may, in its discretion,
assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to the Shareholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) or the Buyer, as applicable,
and (b) shall provide to the Shareholders' Representative and the Buyer a
written explanation of its reasons for making such a determination. The
Auditor shall not be authorized or permitted to: (x) determine any questions
or matters whatsoever under or in connection with this Agreement except for
the resolution of differences between the Shareholders' Representative and the
Buyer regarding the determination of the Working Capital in accordance with
this Section 2.13; or (y) apply any accounting principles, policies, methods,
treatments or procedures other than those used in the preparation of the
Working Capital Exhibit and required by Applicable Law. In all cases, the
Auditor shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator. Within [ * ] after the
selection of the Auditor, the Auditor shall make a determination of all issues
in dispute in connection with the Buyer's Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation pursuant to such procedures as the Auditor deems fair and
reasonable and shall set forth in a written statement delivered to Buyer and
the Shareholders' Representative the final Closing Working Capital Adjustment;
provided however, such final Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be an
amount equal to either the Closing Working Capital Adjustment that was based
on the Buyer's Closing Date Working Capital Calculation or the Company's
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital or an amount in between. Such
determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties absent
fraud or manifest error. The amount equal to the difference of the final
Closing Working Capital Adjustment determined in accordance with this Section
2.13.2 less the Closing Working Capital Adjustment, if any, made pursuant to
Section 2.13.1 is referred to herein as the "Final Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount". If the Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount is
a negative amount, then Buyer shall be entitled to prompt payment from the
Adjustment Escrow Fund of the absolute value of such amount; provided that if
the Adjustment Escrow Amount is less than the amount to be paid to Buyer, then
Buyer shall be entitled to receive such excess amount from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund. If the Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a
positive amount, then Buyer shall promptly pay the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the Company Holders or to the Surviving Corporation for
amounts to be paid through payroll, according to the applicable percentages
set forth on Schedule I, such amount due to them, if any. 

| 
---|--- 

2.13.3.

|

Following the Shareholders' Representative's receipt of the statement setting
forth Buyer's Closing Date Working Capital Calculation, the Buyer and its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, shall provide to the
Shareholders' Representative, and its authorized representatives, reasonable
access to all records used in preparing such Buyer's Closing Date Working
Capital Calculation (and employees of the Buyer or its Affiliates, including
the Surviving Corporation, who can adequately answer questions on Buyer's
Closing Date Working Capital Calculation). 

| 
---|--- 

2.13.4.

|

Other than in the case of Fraud, the Parties agree that the procedures set
forth in this Section 2.13 shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving any disputes with respect to the determination of the Working
Capital and the Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount; provided,
that this provision shall not prohibit the Buyer or the Shareholders'
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce a ruling of the Auditor.

Contingent Payments. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.1.

|

In addition to the Closing Payment payable pursuant to Section 2.7.3(a),
Company Holders shall be entitled to certain additional contingent payments
from Buyer after the Closing as and to the extent set forth in this Section
2.14 (each such additional payment, a "Contingent Payment"), subject to all
the terms and conditions of this Section 2.14. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.2.

|

Buyer shall make the Contingent Payments described below in cash to the Paying
Agent subject to and upon the occurrence of the following events set forth in
the table below (each of such twelve (12) events, a "Milestone"), whether
achieved by or on behalf of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Affiliates, or any Buyer Rights Successor, less any applicable
Contingent Payment Deal Fees. The Paying Agent shall distribute such amounts
to the Company Holders, as set forth in Schedule I, less (without duplication)
any applicable Contingent Payment Deal Fees, with such disbursements paid
through the payroll process of the Surviving Corporation or through the Paying
Agent, as applicable, provided, however, that (a) with respect to any Deferred
Holder (other than the [ * ] and the Designated Individuals), the Deferred
Consideration of such Deferred Holder shall be payable only to the extent and
in accordance with Schedule I or (b) with respect to any Deferred Holder that
is a Designated Individual, such Deferred Holder's Designated Individual
Agreement, and, in each case, any such amounts to which a Deferred Holder does
not become entitled shall be retained by Buyer:

Each Contingent Payment is payable only once. In no event shall any of the
Contingent Payments be paid more than once, regardless of the number of times
the corresponding Milestone is achieved by or on behalf of Buyer, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, or any Buyer Rights
Successor. In the event that (a) the first Clinical Trial that is Initiated
for a Product is also a Pivotal Trial for such Product, then both Milestone
No. 1 and Milestone No. 2 shall be payable on the Initiation of such Clinical
Trial, (b) at the time a Clinical Trial for a Product is Initiated, such
Clinical Trial is not a Pivotal Trial, the Pivotal Trial for such Product
shall be deemed to have occurred on the date on which an Approval Application
is filed in respect of a Product with the appropriate Regulatory Authority in
any country or jurisdiction and (c) Milestone No. 3 is achieved then Milestone
No. 1 and Milestone No. 2 shall be payable upon such achievement of Milestone
No. 3 to the extent not previously paid. [ * ]. 

|

2.14.5.

|

In the event of an Insolvency Event prior to the expiration of Buyer's
obligations set forth in Section 2.14.2, all Contingent Payments will be
deemed to have been paid and a promissory note therefor issued by Buyer to the
Shareholders' Representative (to be held solely on behalf of the Company
Holders and in its capacity as the Shareholders' Representative) in the amount
of such Contingent Payments 91 days prior to such Insolvency Event. 

|

2.14.6.

|

Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing until the earlier to occur of
(i) expiration of Buyer's obligations set forth in Section 2.14.9 and (ii)
achievement of the last Milestone, Buyer shall provide the Shareholders'
Representative, within [ * ] following January 1st of each calendar year, with
a written report summarizing in reasonable detail the status of the
development of each Product with respect to which a Contingent Payment remains
unpaid. Upon the Shareholders' Representative's reasonable request and in a
frequency of no more than once per calendar year, representatives of Buyer
that are familiar with the development status of each such Product shall meet
with the Shareholders' Representative in person, by phone or as otherwise may
be mutually agreed, to discuss the development status of each such Product in
reasonable detail. Notwithstanding Section 6.10, Buyer, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates each agree that the Shareholders' Representative may
disclose the information disclosed hereunder to each Company Holder, and any
Company Holder may disclose such information to any limited partners of such
Company Holder subject to customary confidentiality obligations no less
restrictive than the obligations set forth in Section 6.10 of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.1.

|

Within [ * ] of the occurrence of any Milestone set forth in Section 2.14.2,
Buyer shall provide written notice to the Shareholders' Representative that
such Milestone has occurred. Within [ * ] after the occurrence of a Milestone,
Buyer shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Company Holders or to the Surviving Corporation for
amounts to be paid through payroll an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
amount of the applicable Contingent Payment in accordance with this Section
2.14.

2.14.2.

|

Subject to the terms and conditions of (a) with respect to Deferred Holders
(other than the [ * ] and the Designated Individuals), Schedule I or (b) with
respect to Deferred Holders that are Designated Individuals, such Deferred
Holder's Designated Individual Agreement, each Company Holder shall be
entitled to receive only the portion of any Contingent Payment as set forth in
Schedule I (less such Company Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of any applicable
Contingent Payment Deal Fees) once such Contingent Payment becomes due and
payable in accordance with this Section 2.14. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.3.

|

No interest shall accrue or be paid on any portion of any Contingent Payment,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein. For Tax purposes, however, the
Parties agree that all payments made under this Section 2.14 (other than to
Designated Individuals) shall to the extent permitted by Applicable Law be
reported as additional Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration, as
applicable, except to the extent such amounts are characterized as interest
for Tax purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.4.

|

Following the Closing and continuing until the [ * ] of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) and any Buyer Rights Successor to, use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to achieve each of the Milestones. Subject to the foregoing obligation
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, neither Buyer, Merger Sub nor any of
their respective Affiliates has furnished or provided any assurances regarding
the achievability of the condition to the payment of the Contingent Payments
set forth in this Section 2.14 or the likelihood thereof.

With respect to Contingent Payments made in respect of Designated Company
Restricted Stock, Contingent Payments shall only be made to the extent such
Designated Company Restricted Stock would be vested pursuant to the terms of
the Designated Company Restricted Stock agreement entered into between the
Company and such Deferred Holder in respect of such Designated Company
Restricted Stock as set forth in Schedule I and any such amounts to which a
Deferred Holder does not become entitled shall be retained by Buyer. If any
Contingent Payments become payable hereunder before the Designated Company
Restricted Stock would have vested, such payments shall not be made unless and
until the corresponding Designated Company Restricted Stock would have vested.
If a holder of Designated Company Restricted Stock is terminated following
Closing and, as a result of such termination, would have forfeited his or her
Designated Company Restricted Stock, Buyer will repay to such Deferred Holder
the lesser of (x) the original purchase price set forth in Schedule I, or (y)
the then fair market value of such forfeited Designated Company Restricted
Stock, in each case, as provided pursuant to the terms of the Designated
Company Restricted Stock agreement. In such case, any Contingent Payments
related to Designated Company Restricted Stock that would have been vested by
its terms as of such termination will continue to be paid subject to the terms
of this Section 2.14. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14.6.

|

With respect to Contingent Payments made in respect of Vested Company Stock
Options or Company Restricted Stock with respect to which a valid election
under Section 83(b) of the Code has not been made, no payments shall be made
following the 5th anniversary of the Closing unless the applicable Milestone
to which such Contingent Payment relates constitutes a short-term deferral
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, with any such payments that
are made following the 5th anniversary of the Closing to be paid within the
time period required so that such payments remain short-term deferrals. 

|

2.14.7.

|

After the Closing, no Company Holder may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise
dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of any Contingent

Payments or any portion thereof is to be passed to beneficiaries upon the
death of the trustee; (iii) made pursuant to a court order; (iv) made by
operation of law (including a consolidation or merger) or without
consideration in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination
of any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity;
(v) in the case of Contingent Payments payable to a nominee, from a nominee to
a beneficial owner (and, if applicable, through an intermediary) or from such
nominee to another nominee for the same beneficial owner, in each case as
allowable by a nationally recognized trust company; or (vi) to any Person,
with Buyer's consent. Any transfer in violation of this Section 2.14.13 shall
be null and void and shall not be recognized by Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation.

Escrow. 

| 
---|--- 

2.15.1.

|

In connection with the Closing, Buyer, the Shareholders' Representative and
the Escrow Agent shall have executed and delivered an escrow agreement, in a
form mutually agreed upon between such parties (the "Escrow Agreement"), under
which SunTrust Bank shall act as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") with
respect to (a) an escrow fund into which the Adjustment Escrow Amount is
deposited (the "Adjustment Escrow Fund") for the purpose of securing payment
of any adjustments to the Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.13.2
and an escrow fund into which the Indemnification Escrow Amount is deposited
(the "Indemnification Escrow Fund") for the purpose of securing the payment of
the Company Holders' indemnification obligations pursuant to ARTICLE 8. The
Parties will, to the extent consistent with Applicable Law, treat the
Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Fund and any earnings
thereon as owned by Buyer for Tax purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

2.15.2.

|

Following the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment
Amount and payment of any amounts due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.13.2 in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall make available to
(i) the Surviving Corporation with respect to amounts (A) to be paid through
payroll and (B) which represent Escrow Release Tax Costs or (ii) the Paying
Agent for distribution to the Company Holders of the then-remaining Adjustment
Escrow Amount, and each of the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall pay each Company Holder its Upfront Payment Pro Rata
Percentage of the then-remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount (after appropriate
reduction for any applicable Escrow Release Tax Costs). 

| 
---|--- 

2.15.3.

|

Upon the termination of the Indemnification Escrow Fund on the Escrow
Termination Date in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall make available to (i) the Surviving Corporation with respect to amounts
(A) to be paid through payroll and (B) which represent Escrow Release Tax
Costs or (ii) the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Holders of the
then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount, and each of the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall disburse to the Company
Holders the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount released in
accordance with Section 8.11 (after appropriate reduction, if any, pursuant to
Section 8.4.4 or for any applicable Escrow Release Tax Costs). 

| 
---|--- 

2.15.4.

|

The execution of a Written Consent or the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by the
Company Shareholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and all
arrangements related thereto, including the depositing of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount into the Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount into the Indemnification Escrow Fund. Any interest accruing with
respect to the Adjustment Escrow Fund or the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall
be deemed part of the Adjustment Escrow Amount or the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, respectively, for all indemnification and escrow disbursement purposes
hereunder. The right of any Company Holder to receive its portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Fund, if any, (i) is an
integral part of the Merger Consideration and Option Merger Consideration, as
applicable, provided for in this Agreement, (ii) does not give the Company
Holders dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights
or other rights of holders of capital stock of the Company, (iii) shall not be
evidenced by a certificate or other instrument, (iv) shall not be assignable
or otherwise transferable by such Company Holder, except in the manner as
provided for Contingent Payments set forth in Section 2.14.11, and (v) does
not represent any right other than the right to receive the consideration set
forth in this Section 2.15. Any attempted transfer of the right to any portion
of the Adjustment Escrow Amount or the Indemnification Escrow Amount by any
holder thereof (other than as specifically permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

Dissenting Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

2.16.1.

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a Company Shareholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger,
consented thereto in writing or otherwise contractually waived its rights to
appraisal and who has exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters rights
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 2.7 and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the
DGCL. 

| 
---|--- 

2.16.2.

|

At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the appraised value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 2.16.1, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's
appraisal rights and dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to relief provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's
shares of Company Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 2.7, without interest, following surrender of the
Certificate representing such shares in the manner provided in Section 2.10
or, in the case of a lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed
Certificate, upon delivery of the documents, if required, described in Section
2.10. The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and Buyer
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to any
demand for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand.

Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, (i) Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any portion of
any payment payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement, the [ *
] Deferred Consideration Agreement, the Deferred Consideration
Acknowledgments, the Designated Individual Agreements, the Paying Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such Taxes or other amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Laws, and (ii) any
compensatory amounts payable pursuant to or contemplated by this Agreement,
the [ * ] Deferred Consideration Agreement, the Deferred Consideration
Acknowledgments, the Designated Individual Agreements, the Paying Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be remitted to the Company or
Surviving Corporation for payment to the applicable recipient through regular
payroll procedures, as applicable. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, and will be timely
remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer confirms that it will not, absent a change in Applicable Law, [ * ] (y)
the Company has provided a valid certificate and notice pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h) in accordance with Section 3.2.4 of this
Agreement.

Benefit Plans. 

|

4.18.1.

|

Section 4.18.1 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list
of all: (i) "employee benefit plans," within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ("ERISA"),
whether or not subject to ERISA; (ii) bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, equity or equity-based compensation, stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock, incentive, fringe benefit, voluntary employees'
beneficiary associations under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, profit-sharing,

independent contractor, services agreement, termination, change in control,
retention, and severance Contracts, plans, programs, arrangements, commitments
or practices, in each case, that the Company has established, maintained or
contributed to (or with respect to which an obligation to contribute has been
undertaken) or that the Company is a party to, in each case, with or for the
benefit of, as applicable, any Company Personnel, or with respect to which the
Company has any Liability (collectively, the "Plans"). 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.2.

|

No Plan is, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever at any
time sponsored, contributed to, been required to contribute to, maintained or
had any Liability in respect of, (A) a Plan that is or was subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or (B) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). For this
purpose, "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any person that for purposes of Title I
and Title IV of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code would be deemed at any
relevant time to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.3.

|

All Plans have been administered and operated in all material respects in
compliance with their terms and with all requirements of Applicable Law,
including ERISA and the Code. No event or omission has occurred which would
reasonably be expected to cause any Plan to fail to satisfy the relevant
requirements to provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable Code Section
(including Code Sections 105 and 125). Each Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code (including each related trust intended to be
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code) has received a
favorable IRS determination letter or is comprised of a master or prototype
plan that has received a favorable opinion letter from the IRS upon which it
can rely. Since the date of each such determination letter or opinion letter,
no event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation of any such determination letter or
opinion letter or that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Plan (or the tax-exempt status of any such trust)
or that would reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to the
Company. None of the Plans provide for post-employment or retiree health, life
insurance and/or other welfare benefits (except as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or any similar state law), and the Company has no obligation to
provide any such benefits to any Company Personnel following such person's
retirement or termination of service. Each Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
maintained and operated in both operational and documentary compliance with
Section 409A of the Code in all material respects. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.4.

|

Each Plan may be amended, terminated or otherwise modified by the Company to
the greatest extent permitted by Applicable Law. The Company does not have any
commitment to create, modify or terminate any Plan. No event has occurred, and
no condition or circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material increase in the benefits under or the expense of
maintaining any Plan as compared to the level of benefits or expense incurred
for the most recently ended fiscal year of the Company. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.5.

|

Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, other Persons who participate in the operation of
any Plan or related trust or funding vehicle, has engaged in any transaction
with respect to any Plan or breached any applicable fiduciary responsibilities
or obligations under ERISA or the Code that could reasonably be expected to
result in any claim being made under, by or on behalf of any such Plan by any
Person with standing to make such claim for which the Company could have
material Liability. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.6.

|

Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of
Business, there are no pending Actions or other claims, actions or
investigations, and to the knowledge of the Company no Actions or other
claims, actions or investigations are threatened, against any Plan or
fiduciary of any such Plan by any participant, beneficiary or Governmental
Authority for which the Company could have material Liability, and to the
knowledge of the Company there is no basis to anticipate that any such Actions
will be made or asserted. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
inspections or audits pending to be resolved or implemented by any
Governmental Authority to verify compliance relating to any Plan or term and
condition of employment. To the knowledge of the Company, no Plan or any
fiduciary thereof with respect to any Plan has been the direct or indirect
subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any Governmental
Authority. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.7.

|

The Company has properly classified all individuals who have performed
services for them in accordance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the
Code and other Applicable Law as common law employees, independent contractors
or leased employees, as applicable, other than for such failures to classify
correctly as are not likely to result in any material Liability for the
Company. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.8.

|

The Company does not maintain or have any obligation to contribute to any
"voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code or other funding arrangement for the provision of
welfare benefits. No Plan which is a group health plan is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement," within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.9.

|

Full payment has been timely made of all amounts which the Company is
required, under Applicable Law or under any Plan, applicable collective
bargaining agreement or any Contract relating to any Plan to which the Company
is a party, to have paid as contributions or premiums thereto as of the last
day of the most recent fiscal year of such Plan ended prior to the date hereof
and such contributions or premiums have been timely deposited into the
appropriate trusts or accounts. 

| 
---|--- 

4.18.10.

|

Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor the conduct of the business of the
Company by the Company Personnel (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event) will (i) terminate or modify, or give any
Person a right to terminate or modify, the provisions or terms of any Plan,
policy, Contract, arrangement or commitment (including employment agreements),
whether or not legally enforceable or (ii) result in any payment or benefits
(whether of severance pay or otherwise) or any acceleration of, vesting of or
increase in or funding of payments or benefits to any employee or director or
former employee or director of, or other present or former provider of
services to, the Company. Except as set forth on Section 4.18.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule, no Plan provides for the payment of severance,
termination, change-in-control or any similar type of payments or benefits.

liable pursuant to Section 8.2. The Shareholders' Representative shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by any Company Holder or any of
their Affiliates of notice of any pending, proposed, threatened or actual Tax
audit, assessment or other claim by a Taxing Authority for any period of or
relating to the Company. To the extent that the Company Holders are liable
pursuant to Section 8.2 for Taxes that could be payable as a result of such
audit or other proceeding and such audit or other proceeding relates solely to
a period ending on or before the Closing Date, the Shareholders'
Representative shall have the right to control the defense in such audit or
other proceeding and to employ counsel and other advisors of its choice at the
Company Holders' expense; provided, however, that Buyer (along with counsel
and other advisors of its choice) shall be entitled to participate in such
audit or proceeding; and provided, further, that the Shareholders'
Representative shall not settle or compromise any such audit or proceeding
without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,

Straddle Tax Period, Buyer shall be entitled to control the defense employing
counsel and other advisors of its choice at its expense, provided that the

For purposes of this Agreement, all Taxes of the Company that relate to a

measured by income, activities, events, payments, the level of any item, gain,
receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for Tax periods (or the
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date will be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Tax Period, and (ii) the determination of any other Taxes for the
portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period
beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the
Company had a taxable year or period which ended at the close of business on
the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions or any other
items that are calculated on an annual or periodic basis, shall be prorated on
the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed through the
Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual period elapsing
after the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

6.4.9.

|

With respect to any income tax period ending on the Closing Date (including
without limitation any U.S. federal income tax period that ends on the Closing

apportioning income to the period ending on the Closing Date to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Tax Law. 

|

6.4.10.

|

The Company Holders shall be entitled to any refunds (including any interest
paid thereon) of Taxes of the Company that were (i) paid by the Company prior
to the Closing Date or (ii) indemnified by the Company Holders pursuant to an
obligation under Article VIII, in each case to the extent attributable to
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date,
but only to the extent such refunds were not taken into account in Working
Capital (as finally determined) and are not attributable to the carryback of a
net operating loss, deduction or other Tax attribute of the Company from a
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, and in each case
shall be net of any Tax or other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees, and
expenses payable or incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with
the receipt or payment over of such refund. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with the Shareholders' Representative in obtaining any
refund to which the Company Holders are entitled under this Section 6.4.10.
The Buyer shall promptly forward to or reimburse the Company Holders for any
amounts due to the Company Holders pursuant to this Section 6.4.10 after
receipt thereof (or credit of such refund against other Taxes).

resolution of a Tax audit, the Buyer shall not (and shall not cause or permit
the Company to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return filed
pursuant to Section 6.4.1 or 6.4.2, initiate any voluntary disclosure, or
agree to the waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations, in each
case, for the Company with respect to any Taxable period (or portion thereof)

The Company shall not, and shall cause its employees, officers, directors,

any other action designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to,
facilitate, any Transaction Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise

of the Company pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the
Constitutive Documents of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and pursuant to any indemnity agreements between the Company and
such Person as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the Persons entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions, and all other current and
former directors and officers of the Company, being referred to collectively
as the "DandO Indemnified Parties"). Buyer shall cause the Constitutive
Documents of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability that are
substantially similar to those set forth in the Company's Constitutive
Documents on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time in any manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any DandO Indemnified Party. 

| 
---|--- 

6.7.2.

|

Solely to the extent the Company has bound a directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage for the DandO Indemnified Parties prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, prior to the Effective Time, a
prepaid extended non-cancelable reporting period endorsement or a run-off
policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage for the DandO Indemnified Parties that shall provide such DandO
Indemnified Parties with coverage for six years following the Effective Time
of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially
less favorable to the insured Persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company (the "DandO
Tail Policy"). Buyer shall and shall cause the Company to, (i) upon the
request of Shareholders' Representative, make any claim for coverage under any
such policy and take any action reasonably requested by Shareholders'
Representative to obtain reimbursement for covered losses under any such
policy or to otherwise enforce any such policy or any provision thereof, and
(ii) notify Shareholders' Representative of any material development which
affects or limits the coverage available under the DandO Tail Policy. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for the cost of the DandO Tail Policy, including the
amount of the premium required to be paid for the DandO Tail Policy; provided,
that Buyer shall not be required to pay an aggregate amount for the DandO Tail
Policy in excess of [ * ] of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the Closing. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

6.7.3.

|

This Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Company,
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the DandO Indemnified Parties, and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. 

|

statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

Release of Claims. Effective upon the Closing, except with respect to a claim
arising out of this Agreement or any ancillary agreement, document or
instrument to be delivered in connection herewith and therewith (other than in
respect of claims of each Company Holder described in subclause (B) below),
each Company Holder hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, fully
releases and forever discharges the Company, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and their past and present directors, officers, employees, agents,
predecessors, successors, assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers and
Affiliates (the "Released Parties") from, and covenants not to (a) sue or (b)
participate in any civil action against any of the Released Parties for, any
and all Liabilities and Actions of any kind or nature whatsoever, in each case
whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated and known or
unknown (the "Claims") with respect to (A) facts and circumstances existing at
or prior to the Effective Time that have been or could be asserted against a
Released Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (B) the allocation of the Closing Payment and the Contingent
Payments pursuant to this Agreement (including with respect to the timing and
the amount of such payments), and, in each case ((A) and (B)), such Company
Holder shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or
thereunder from such Released Parties. Such released Liabilities shall include
any right to recover against the Released Parties for any indemnification
claims made against or paid by a Company Holder pursuant to ARTICLE 8. Each
Company Holder understands that this is a full and final release of all
claims, demands, causes of action and Liabilities of any nature whatsoever,
whether or not known, suspected or claimed, that could have been asserted in
any legal or equitable proceeding against the Released Parties, except as
expressly set forth in this Section 6.8. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing release shall not apply and none of the following shall be released
by each Company Holder: (i) if the Company Holder is an employee of any of the
Released Parties, Claims for any benefit, wages or salary earned by the
Company Holder arising out of or related to the Company Holder's employment by
any of the Released Parties to the extent earned and unpaid, (ii) Claims and
rights of the Company Holder for indemnification and reimbursement by any of
the Released Parties under the Constitutive Documents or under any Contract
entered into by any of the Released Parties and the Company Holder (to the
extent such Contract is set forth on Section 4.13.1(q) of the Disclosure
Schedule), (iii) Claims of the Company Holder as a service provider or
licensor of any of the Released Parties and (iv) Claims of the Company Holder
to its right to receive the Closing Payment or Contingent Payments, as
appropriate, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that, in
each case, the Company Holder shall be subject to the no-circular recovery
provisions set forth in Section 8.10. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, each Company Holder expressly waives the benefit of any Applicable Law,
which, if applied to the release set forth in this Section 6.8, would
otherwise exclude from its binding effect any Claim not known by such Company
Holder at the Effective Time to exist. Each Company Holder represents that it
is not aware of any Claim by it other than the Claims that are waived,
released and forever discharged by this Section 6.8. For the avoidance of
doubt, the release set forth in this Section 6.8 is an integral part of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such
release, none of the Company, Buyer nor Merger Sub would have entered into
this Agreement. Further, nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall be
construed to prohibit a Company Holder from filing a charge with or
participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a comparable state or local agency,
provided, however, that each Company Holder hereby agrees to waive its, his or
her right to recover monetary damages or other individual relief in any such
charge, investigation or proceeding or any related complaint or lawsuit filed
by the Company Holder or by anyone else on its, his or her behalf.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8, [ * ].

Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective businesses, assets and properties.

Party's Confidential Information to any third party (including any of the
Company's investors, collaborators or licensees) engaged in the research,
development, manufacture or commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Each
Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.10 by any of its
disclosees that would breach this Agreement if made by such Party.

---|--- 

8.3.1.

|

the breach or violation of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty

Limits on Indemnification. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.1.

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
the Company Holder Indemnified Parties nor Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.2.1, or 8.3.1,
as applicable, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from such Indemnifying Party under Sections 8.2.1 or
8.3.1, as the case may be, equals or exceeds [ * ] (such amount, the
"Basket"), after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for Losses in
excess of the Basket; provided, however, that the Basket shall not apply to
breaches of, or inaccuracies in, (A) the Fundamental Representations or (B)
any representations or warranties due to Fraud. Claims for indemnification
pursuant to any other provision of Sections 8.2 or 8.3 are not subject to the
monetary limitations set forth in this Section 8.4.1; provided, however, that
in no event shall the aggregate amount of any Losses for which indemnification
is provided under Section 8.3 exceed the Purchase Price plus any Contingent
Payment that becomes due and payable to the Company Holders. The amount of any
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE 8 shall be net
of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or contractual indemnification or contribution provisions of other
agreements covering such Losses (net of the out-of-pocket costs reasonably
incurred for pursuing or obtaining such insurance proceeds, deductibles and
any increased premium amounts attributable to such claim). An Indemnified
Party shall take commercially reasonable steps required by Applicable Law to
mitigate any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE 8
upon becoming aware of any event that gives rise thereto. If an Indemnified
Party (or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in connection with any
claim for Losses for which it has already received an indemnification payment
from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within 30
days of receiving such insurance payment, any amount that the Indemnifying
Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this ARTICLE 8 had such insurance
payment been made at the time of such indemnification payment solely to avoid
duplicative recovery for the same Loss, but not in excess of any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter. The amount of Losses recoverable
by an Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 8 with respect to an indemnity
claim shall be reduced by the net reduction in cash Taxes payable or paid that
is actually received (including by way of a refund) by an Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates with respect to the taxable year of the occurrence of the Loss
giving rise to the indemnification obligation as a result of the incurrence of
the applicable Loss, determined on a "with and without" basis. In no event
shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any Losses or other
amounts under this ARTICLE 8 that are punitive damages (except to the extent
such punitive damages are awarded to a third party). 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.2.

|

[ * ]. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any
Party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek
rescission of the transactions consummated by this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.3.

|

In the case of Buyer's rights to indemnification for Material Claims, for as
long as there are funds available in the Indemnification Escrow Fund to cover
the Buyer Indemnified Parties' indemnifiable Losses, any and all Losses
payable by the Company Holders as Indemnifying Parties to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to a Material Claim will be paid in cash
first out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and in the event such Losses in
respect of Material Claims exceed, or are not paid and satisfied in full from,
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to satisfy in full such Losses by pursuing indemnification rights and
recourse directly against the Company Holders in accordance with each Company
Holder's Aggregate Payment Pro Rata Percentage of the Merger Consideration and
Option Merger Consideration up to the aggregate Merger Consideration and
Option Merger Consideration actually paid, or that becomes due and payable in
accordance with Section 2.14, to each Company Holder. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.4.

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, in no
event shall a Company Holder be liable under this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection
therewith for any Losses in excess of the Merger Consideration and Option
Merger Consideration actually paid, or that becomes due and payable in
accordance with Section 2.14, to him, her or it. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.5.

|

In the case of Losses arising out of or resulting from Company Holder
Indemnity Events, the liability of each Company Holder for Company Holder
Indemnity Events shall be solely with respect to Company Holder Indemnity
Events committed by such Company Holder (the "Indemnifying Company Holder")
and not with respect to Company Holder Indemnity Events committed by any other
Company Holder, and any Losses arising out of or based upon a Company Holder
Indemnity Event that is satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or
Buyer's right of set-off against Contingent Payments under Section 8.8, as
appropriate, shall reduce the Indemnifying Company Holder's entitlement to the
Indemnification Escrow Fund or Contingent Payments, as appropriate, and not
any other Company Holder's entitlement to the Indemnification Escrow Fund or
Contingent Payments, as appropriate; provided, however, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall have the right, but not the obligation, to satisfy all or a
portion of the Losses arising out of or relating to a Company Holder Indemnity
Event by pursuing indemnification rights and recourse directly against the
Company Holder that committed the Company Holder Indemnity Event without
having to first resort to obtaining payment from such Indemnifying Company
Holder's portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund or exercising Buyer's
rights of set-off under Section 8.8 against such Indemnifying Company Holder's
portion of Contingent Payments. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.6.

|

The right of Buyer to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 will not be
affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to any accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance with any covenant
or agreement herein. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.7.

|

For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Claims" means [ * ]. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4.8.

|

No Company Holder shall be liable to any other Person for any Losses pursuant
to this ARTICLE 8 that arise out of or relate to a breach of or inaccuracy of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement (and the amount of any Losses incurred in respect of such breach or
inaccuracy shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) to the extent the Loss is actually deducted
from the Closing Payment or actually included in the determination of the
Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

8.4.9.

[ * ].

8.5.

|

Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims. 

| 
---|--- 

8.5.1.

|

A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim
may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought. Such notice shall include the facts constituting the basis for such
claim for indemnification and the sections of this Agreement upon which such
claim for indemnification is then based. 

| 
---|--- 

8.5.2.

|

Each Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party in writing if it
becomes aware of a claim for which the Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification hereunder. If any Action is instituted against a Party with
respect to which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 8.3, as
applicable, the Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice of the
indemnity claim to the Indemnifying Party and provide the Indemnifying Party
with a copy of any complaint, summons or other written notice that the
Indemnified Party receives in connection with any such Action. An Indemnified
Party's failure to deliver such written notice will relieve the Indemnifying
Party of liability to the Indemnified Party under Sections 8.2 or 8.3, as
applicable, only to the extent such delay materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such claim. The Indemnified Party will
permit the Indemnifying Party to participate in such Action and assume the
defense and disposition thereof by negotiated settlement or otherwise (subject
to this Section 8.5) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not have the right
to assume the defense of any Action if (a) the Indemnified Party will have one
or more legal or equitable defenses available to it which are different from
or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, counsel for the Indemnifying
Party would not adequately represent the interests of the Indemnified Party
because such interests would be in conflict with those of the Indemnifying
Party or (b) the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of the Action
in a timely fashion (but in any event within 30 days after receiving notice of
such Action). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Action, the
Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any Action at its
expense. The assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party will not be
construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party is liable to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Action, nor will it
constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert
against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. The Indemnifying
Party will act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters
relating to such claim and will not settle or otherwise resolve such claim
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party will
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the Indemnifying Party's defense of
any claim for which indemnity is sought under this Agreement, at the
Indemnifying Party's cost and expense. If it is ultimately determined that the
Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party from
and against such claim, the Indemnified Party will reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any Liability incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of
such claim. 

| 
---|--- 

8.5.3.

|

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Third Party Claims with respect to Taxes that
involve a Taxing Authority shall be governed by Section 6.4.7, and not the
preceding Sections 8.5.1 or 8.5.2. 

| 
---|--- 

8.6.

|

Tax Treatment. To the extent permitted by Tax Law, the Parties agree to treat
all payments made under this ARTICLE 8 as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration and Option Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes (other than
payments to Designated Individuals). 

| 
---|--- 

8.7.

|

Remedies. From and after the Closing, except as specifically provided herein
under Section 2.13, the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for
any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
document, certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto or the
transactions contemplated herein or therein shall be indemnification in
accordance with this ARTICLE 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
8.7 shall not operate to limit the rights of the Parties to seek equitable
remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief) or any remedies
available to it under Applicable Law in the event of (i) Fraud by the Company
or the Buyer, in each case solely against the persons who committed such
Fraud, (ii) a Party's failure to comply with its indemnification obligations
hereunder and (iii) a Party's breach or violation of any covenant in this
Agreement that is to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

8.8.

|

Set-Off. In addition to all other remedies contemplated herein, Buyer may set
off, deduct or retain any amount due to Buyer in respect of any claim for
indemnification against any of the Company Holders pursuant to this Agreement
against any payments which Buyer may be obliged to make (or procure to be
made) to the Company Holders pursuant to this Agreement, including any
obligation of Buyer to pay any Contingent Payment; [ * ]. 

| 
---|--- 

8.9.

|

No Right of Contribution. No Company Holder shall have any right of
contribution against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements. 

| 
---|--- 

8.10.

|

No Circular Recovery. Each Company Holder hereby agrees that it will not make
any claim for indemnification against Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company by reason of the fact that such Company Holder was a controlling
Person, director, employee or Representative of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or was serving as such for another Person at the request of Buyer
or the Company (whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, organizational document,
contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by an
Indemnified Party against any Company Holder relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to any claim brought by
an Indemnified Party against any Company Holder relating to this Agreement and
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each Company Holder expressly
waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or
other claim against the Company with respect to any amounts owed by such
Company Holder pursuant to this ARTICLE 8. 

| 
---|--- 

8.11.

|

Release of Indemnification Escrow Fund. Subject to Section 2.15.2, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, on the
Escrow Termination Date, any amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Fund, minus any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund subject to pending
claims for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE 8 (including any accrued
or estimated fees and expenses associated with such claim), shall be released
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund for disbursement to the Company Holders
or to the Surviving Corporation for amounts to be paid through payroll
(subject to applicable withholding), or for retention by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to an amount equal to any applicable Escrow Release
Tax Costs. On the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Termination
Date, the Paying Agent and Surviving Corporation shall (and shall be
instructed by the Shareholders' Representative and the Buyer to) pay such
released amount (subject to applicable withholding and less any applicable
Escrow Release Tax Costs) to the Company Holders in accordance with this
Agreement and Schedule I. Subject to Section 2.15.2, any remaining portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, after payment and satisfaction of any and all
pending claims for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE 8, shall be
released from the Indemnification Escrow Fund for disbursement to the Company
Holders or to the Surviving Corporation for amounts to be paid through payroll
(subject to applicable withholding), or for retention by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to an amount equal to any applicable Escrow Release
Tax Costs, promptly following resolution of such pending claims.

This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger contemplated hereby may be

(a)

|

by Buyer by written notice to the Company if the Shareholder Approval has not
been delivered to Buyer by [ * ]; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

by mutual consent of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

by Buyer, if there has been a breach by the Company of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer
pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 at the Closing and such breach has not been
waived by Buyer, or cured by the Company within [ * ] after written notice
thereof from Buyer; provided that Buyer will not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1.1(c) if Buyer is then in material
violation or breach of any of its covenants, obligations, representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

by the Company, if there has been a breach by Buyer of any covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Company
pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.3 at the Closing and such breach has not been
waived by the Company, or cured by Buyer within [ * ] after written notice
thereof by the Company; provided that the Company will not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1.1(d) if the Company is
then in material violation or breach of any of its covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement; or 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

by either Buyer or the Company if the Closing Date does not occur by [ * ]
(the "Outside Date") (provided, however, that (i) Buyer will not have the

is then in material violation or breach of any of its covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the Company
will not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1.1(e) if the Company is then in material violation or breach of any of its
covenants, obligations, representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement); and (iii) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1.1(e) shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the Merger to
have been consummated on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the
failure of such Party to perform any of its material obligations under this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2.

|

Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this
ARTICLE 9, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect,
except for the provisions of Sections 2.11.3 (Shareholders' Representative
Indemnification), 6.10 (Confidentiality), 7.2 (Publicity), 7.4 (Expenses),
this 9.2 (Effect of Termination), and ARTICLE 10 (Miscellaneous) (in each case
including the respective meanings ascribed to the related capitalized terms in
Article I (Definitions)); provided that nothing in this Section 9.2 shall be
deemed to (a) release any Party from any liability for any breach by such
Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of
any Party to compel specific performance by the other Party of its respective
obligations under this Agreement, and (b) nothing in this ARTICLE 9 shall
limit the liability of any Party hereto for Fraud or Willful Breach, in each
case, including, in the case of damages sought by the Company, damages based
on the consideration payable to the Company Holders pursuant to this
Agreement. For purposes of clause (b) in the foregoing sentence, Willful
Breach shall mean "the breach of a covenant or obligation under this Agreement
where: (w) such covenant or obligation is material to the ability of the
breaching Party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement; (x) the
breach Party shall have materially and willfully breached such covenant or
obligation; (y) the breach of such covenant or obligation shall not have been
cured in all material respects; and (z) and executive officer of the breaching
Party had actual knowledge, at the time of such breach of such covenant or
obligation, (i) that the breaching Party was breaching such covenant or
obligation and (ii) of the consequences of such breach under this Agreement."

of this Agreement.

Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a)
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware (or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware)
for the purpose of any disputes, suits, actions or proceedings of any nature
arising under, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement ("Disputes")

not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (c) agrees that service of process may
be made in the manner provided for in Section 10.1 or such other manner as may

other than the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Dispute with respect to this Agreement, (x)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this Section 10.5, (y) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise); and (z) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
claim that (A) the Dispute in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum;
(B) the venue of such Dispute is improper; or (C) this Agreement, or the
subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND FOREGO ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This
Section 10.5 shall not apply to any dispute under Section 2.13 that is
required to be decided by the Auditor. Each Party hereby waives any defenses
in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
During the pendency of any dispute resolution proceeding between the Parties
under this Section 10.5, the obligation to make any payment under this
Agreement from one Party to the other Party, which payment is the subject, in
whole or in part, of a proceeding under this Section 10.5, shall be tolled
until the final outcome of such dispute has been established. 

|

10.6.

|

Waiver. No provision of this Agreement will be waived by any act, omission or
knowledge of a Party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in
writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly authorized
officer of the waiving Party. The waiver by any of the Parties of any breach
of any provision hereof by any other Party will not be construed to be a
waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision
itself. Except as expressly set forth in ARTICLE 8, the remedies provided for
herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be
available to any Party at Applicable Law, in equity or otherwise. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7.

|

Amendment. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time, whether before or after
the Shareholder Approval has been obtained; provided, however, that, after the
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by Applicable Law requires further approval by shareholders of either Party,
without the further approval of such shareholders. No amendment, modification
or supplement of any provision of this Agreement will be valid or effective
unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of each Party.
To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer and the Shareholders'
Representative may cause this Agreement to be amended at any time after the
Closing by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer and
the Shareholders' Representative. 

| 
---|--- 

10.8.

|

Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure Schedule and
exhibits and all ancillary agreements, documents or instruments to be
delivered in connection herewith and therewith, constitute and contain the
complete, final and exclusive understanding and agreement of the Parties and
cancels and supersedes any and all prior negotiations, correspondence,
understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, among the Parties
respecting the subject matter hereof and thereof, including that certain
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2018, by and between
Company and Buyer, as amended, which is hereby superseded and replaced in its
entirety as of the date hereof, and any Confidential Information disclosed by
a Party under such agreement will be treated in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

10.9.

|

No Third-Party Rights or Obligations. No provision of this Agreement will be
deemed or construed in any way to result in the creation of any rights or
obligations in any Person not a Party to this Agreement (except that ARTICLE 8
is intended to benefit the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Company Holder
Indemnified Parties). No covenant or other undertaking in this Agreement shall
constitute the establishment or termination of, or an amendment to any Plan,
or any other plan, program, policy or arrangement, and any covenant or
undertaking that suggests that a Plan will be amended, shall be effective only
upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with the amendment
procedures of such Plan. Nothing in this Section 10.9 shall be construed to
impair the rights and powers of the Shareholders' Representative to take or
refrain from taking any action for and on behalf of the Company Holders to
enforce the rights of the Company Holders under this Agreement as provided in
Section 2.11. 

| 
---|--- 

10.10.

|

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which will be an original and all of which, taken together, will
constitute the same document. Counterparts may be signed and delivered by
facsimile or digital transmission (e.g., .pdf), each of which will be binding
when received by the applicable Party. 

| 
---|--- 

10.11.

|

Severability. If any clause or portion thereof in this Agreement is for any
reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same will not affect
any other portion of this Agreement, as it is the intent of the Parties that
this Agreement will be construed in such fashion as to maintain its existence,
validity and enforceability to the greatest extent possible. In any such
event, this Agreement will be construed as if such clause of portion thereof
had never been contained in this Agreement, and there will be deemed
substituted therefor such provision as will most nearly carry out the intent
of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law. 

| 
---|--- 

10.12.

|

English Language. This Agreement shall be written and executed in, and all
other communications under or in connection with this Agreement shall be in,
the English language. Any translation into any other language shall not be an
official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation
between the English version and such translation, the English version shall
control. 

| 
---|--- 

10.13.

|

Representation by Legal Counsel. Each Party hereto represents that it has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and
acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting hereof. In interpreting
and applying the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree
that no presumption will exist or be implied against the Party that drafted
such terms and provisions. 

| 
---|--- 

10.14.

|

Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and Buyer agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of future subsidiaries to waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to any
representation after the Closing (any "Post-Closing Representation") of the
Shareholders' Representative, any Company Holders, any of their respective
Affiliates or any officer, employee or director of the Shareholders'
Representative, any Company Holders or the Company (any such Person, a
"Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including
any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding and including any
matter regarding the negotiation, execution, performance or enforceability
hereof or thereof) by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in respect of
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP's representation of the Company
prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement (the "Current
Representation").

10.15.

|

Non-Assertion of Attorney Client Privilege. As of the Effective Time, Buyer
hereby agrees not to control or assert, and Buyer agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its future subsidiaries not to control or
assert, any attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other
similar privilege or protection applicable to any communication between Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP and any Designated Person during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and each of its future subsidiaries), it being the intention of the
parties hereto that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or Section 259 of the DGCL, all rights of any Person under or with
respect to such attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other
similar privilege or protection, including the right to waive, assert and
otherwise control such attorney-client privilege, work product protection or
other similar privilege or protection, shall be (and are hereby) transferred
to or retained by (as applicable), and vested solely in, such Designated
Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates, and a Person not a party to this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party.
