receive the Shares to PHSI upon the Closing);

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, concurrently

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, CECity and the Shareholders shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth a good faith estimate of (i) the
Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), as of the
Effective Time and as estimated in accordance with the Closing Net Working
Capital Principles, (ii) the amount of Cash Equivalents to be held by CECity
and CECity Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing Cash
Amount_ ") and (iii) the amount of Indebtedness of CECity and CECity
Subsidiary, if any, as of the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing
Indebtedness Amount_ ").

 

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders
the following (collectively, the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ "):

 

(A) a statement setting forth (x) a reasonably detailed calculation by Buyer
of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, prepared by Buyer in
accordance with the Closing Net Working Capital Principles, (y) the amount of
any Cash Equivalents held by CECity and CECity Subsidiary as of the Effective
Time and (z) the amount of any Indebtedness of CECity and CECity Subsidiary
as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Closing Adjustment Amounts_ ");
and

 

(B) a certificate of an executive officer of Buyer certifying that the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement has been prepared in accordance with the
Closing Net Working Capital Principles.

(ii) If the Shareholders disagree with BuyerÂ’s calculation of any Closing
Adjustment Amount, ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall promptly, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days after receiving the Preliminary
Adjustment

 



4  Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver to Buyer written notice
describing its dispute by specifying those items or amounts as to which the
Shareholders disagree, together with the ShareholdersÂ’ determination of such
disputed items or amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If ShareholdersÂ’
Representative either gives notice that it agrees with BuyerÂ’s calculation of
the Closing Adjustment Amounts or fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within
the Review Period, Buyer and the Shareholders agree that the Closing
Adjustment Amounts as set forth on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall
be deemed to constitute the Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash
Amount and Final Closing Indebtedness Amount as of the date of such notice of
agreement or the date of the day immediately following the last day of the
Review Period, as applicable. If ShareholdersÂ’ Representative delivers
a Dispute Notice to Buyer within the Review Period, ShareholdersÂ’
Representative and Buyer will use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute
during the 30-day period commencing on the date ShareholdersÂ’ Representative
delivers the Dispute Notice to Buyer (and all such discussions related
thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the United States Federal Rules of
Evidence, and any applicable similar state rule and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible in any future proceedings between the
parties) and, in the event ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and Buyer resolve such
dispute, the Closing Adjustment Amounts, as agreed in connection with
resolving such dispute, shall be deemed to constitute the Final Net Working
Capital, Final Closing Cash Amount and Final Closing Indebtedness Amount as of
the date that such dispute is so resolved. If Buyer and ShareholdersÂ’
Representative are not able to resolve all disputed items within such 30-day
period, then either party shall have the right to submit the items in dispute
following the expiration of such 30-day period to Source One Business Services
LLC, or if Source One Business Services LLC is unwilling to serve, to another
mutually acceptable internationally recognized independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable
access to all relevant records of CECity to calculate the Closing Adjustment
Amounts and each of Buyer and ShareholdersÂ’ Representative will be afforded
an opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with the
Accounting Firm (with any such materials to be submitted to the Accounting
Firm within ten days following the expiration of the 30-day period referenced
above). The Accounting Firm shall calculate, based solely on the written
submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, on
the other hand, and not by independent investigation, the Closing Adjustment
Amounts and shall be instructed that its calculation (A) must be made in
accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement
(including the Closing Net Working Capital Principles) and Exhibit B, and (B)
with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values
established for such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned
to such amount by ShareholdersÂ’ Representative in the Dispute Notice and by
Buyer in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Accounting Firm shall
submit such calculation (including sufficient explanation for the basis of
each calculation) to ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and Buyer as soon as

 



5  practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the remaining
issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination by
the Accounting Firm of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, as set forth in a
written notice delivered to Buyer and ShareholdersÂ’ Representative by the
Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement, will, in the absence of
fraud or manifest error, be binding and conclusive on Buyer and the
Shareholders as of the date of such notice. In making its determination, the
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The scope of
the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to
the determination of whether the Closing Adjustment Amounts were properly
calculated in accordance with the Closing Net Working Capital Principles, and
the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination or interpretations
with respect to this Agreement. The Closing Adjustment Amounts as determined
after all disputes have been resolved in accordance with this Section
2.3(b)(ii) are referred to herein as the " _Final Net Working Capital_ " with
respect to the final determination of the Net Working Capital, as the "
_Final Closing Cash Amount_ " with respect to the final determination of the
amount of any Cash Equivalents held by CECity and CECity Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time and as the " _Final Closing Indebtedness Amount_ " with
respect to the final determination of the amount of any Indebtedness of CECity
and CECity Subsidiary of the Effective Time.

any material employment, deferred compensation, severance, consulting, non-

any Tax claim or assessment relating to CECity or CECity Subsidiary, surrender
any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to
CECity or CECity Subsidiary, if such election, change, amendment, agreement,
settlement, surrender, or consent would have the effect of increasing the Tax
liability of CECity or CECity Subsidiary for any period ending after the
Closing Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of CECity or CECity Subsidiary
existing on the Closing Date; or

(l) agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,

the Closing, CECity will give Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access
to the Books and Records and to such personnel, offices and other facilities
and properties of CECity and to furnish such other information in respect of
the operation of the Business as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
that all requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be made in
writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with Ananth Bhogaraju or such
person

 



27  or persons as he/she shall designate; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at a reasonable time, upon reasonable advance notice
to CECity, and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of any business conducted by CECity; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any such access or information request shall not involve any Phase 2
environmental assessment or other invasive sampling, investigation or work of
any kind. All such information and access shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the confidentiality agreement dated May 4, 2015 between Buyer
and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. on behalf of CECity (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither CECity nor its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to Buyer or
its Representatives any information (i) related to the Sale Process or CECity
or its RepresentativesÂ’ evaluation thereof including projections, financial or
other information related thereto other than projections, financial or other
information prepared in the ordinary course of business without
being primarily prepared for the Sale Process, (ii) if doing so presents a
reasonable risk of violating any Contract or Law to which CECity is a party or
to which it is subject or which it believes in good faith could result in a
loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege, (iii) if
CECity, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably
pertinent thereto or (iv) if CECity determines in good faith that such

and suppliers of CECity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby only with the prior written consent of CECity.

report form pursuant to the HSR Act as required for the transactions
contemplated hereby, and request early termination of such filing;

 



28 (ii) CECity and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made

any other applicable Regulatory Law in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) timely making all such filings and

(iii) CECity and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent permitted by Law, promptly furnish the other with
copies of notices or other communications (or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally of such communications) between
CECity or Buyer and their respective Representatives and counsel, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any Governmental
Authority with respect to such transactions. CECity and Buyer shall keep each
other timely apprised of any inquiries or requests for additional information
from any Governmental Authority pursuant to any Regulatory Law, and shall
comply promptly with any such reasonable inquiry or request. CECity and Buyer
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of CECity and Buyer agrees
not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person
or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.
Neither party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or withdraw its notification

any Regulatory Law unless the other party has given its prior written consent

conditioned or delayed;

 

(iv) Buyer shall take or cause to be taken any and all action reasonably
necessary, including but not limited to (A) selling or otherwise disposing

Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing) (each a "
_Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Authority enters any
order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to ensure
that no Governmental Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or
otherwise approve the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, fails to do so by the Outside Date. In the event that any action is
threatened or instituted challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any antitrust Law, Buyer shall take all action
reasonably necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture Action to
avoid or resolve such action. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep CECity fully informed of all matters,
discussions and activities relating to any of the matters described in or
contemplated by clauses (A) through (E) of this Section 6.3(b)(iv); and

(v) without limiting Section 6.3(b)(iv), each of CECity and Buyer (and Buyer
shall cause its Affiliates to), in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the acquisition of the Shares or the other transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent
or delay consummation of the acquisition of the Shares or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall use its reasonable best
efforts necessary to avoid, vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order
so as to permit such consummation by no later than the Outside Date.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
except as required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and CECity, the Shareholders, the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and their
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall not, without the prior written consent of
CECity or Buyer, respectively, engage in any action or enter into any
transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into, which would reasonably be likely to prevent or materially delay the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Buyer or its
Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or
division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not reasonably be
likely to (x) materially increase the risk of not obtaining any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
any Regulatory Law; (y) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or

 



30  materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (z) delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 6.4 _Further Assurances_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and subject to Section 6.3, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing Date to take or
cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto; (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
Governmental Authorities required to be obtained by CECity, the Shareholders
or Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to Regulatory Laws
which are the subject of Section 6.3); (iii) to the extent consistent with the
obligations of the parties set forth in Section 6.3, the defending of any
Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution
and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions, as
the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent
of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the employment of the CECity
employees by CECity shall not be terminated by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the CECity employees shall, by operation of
law, remain employed by CECity immediately after the Closing. Except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law, prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to each employee of
CECity a written notice of his or her continuing employment, setting forth
generally the terms and conditions of the employeeÂ’s employment (which
may include, for example, title, position, duties, base salary or wages,
incentive compensation opportunity and benefits) effective as of the Closing
Date, which terms and conditions shall be substantially identical to or better
than those in effect with respect to such individual immediately before the
Closing Date. For two (2) years following the Closing Date, as long as such
employee is employed by CECity or any of its Affiliates, Buyer shall provide
compensation (e.g., base salary or wage rate, variable compensation and long-
term non-equity compensation) not less favorable and benefits (e.g.,
severance, pension and active and retiree welfare benefits) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in effect with respect to such
individual immediately before the Closing Date (other than those employees
entering into the Employment Agreements, in which cases the employment and
compensation terms and conditions regarding such control the compensation and
employment terms of such employees). Each employee who continues employment
with CECity, Buyer or BuyerÂ’s Affiliates after the Closing shall be referred
to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_."

 

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and as applicable shall cause
its Affiliates to, give Transferred Employees service credit for all
purposes, including for

 



31  purposes of eligibility to participate and receive benefits, vesting,
determination of the level of benefits and benefit accrual under any employee
benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, except to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits for service with
CECity prior to the Closing Date, but in any event only to the extent such
service was recognized under a Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

(c) Buyer shall, and as applicable shall cause its Affiliates to (in each case
to the extent allowed by applicable Law), (i) cause any preexisting condition
restrictions, other restrictions or waiting periods under employee benefit
plans of Buyer or its Affiliates to be waived to the extent necessary to
provide immediate coverage to each Transferred Employee who was covered as of
the Closing Date under Benefit Plans that provide medical or dental benefits
and (ii) cause any employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates which is a
welfare benefit plan to apply any amounts paid under a welfare benefit plan
of CECity by a Transferred Employee as deductibles and coinsurance during the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs toward deductible, coinsurance and
out-of-pocket limits under such plan of Buyer or its Affiliates for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs (with appropriate adjustments for
differences in plan years).

 

(d) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, honor all accrued but
untaken vacation credited to Transferred Employees and recorded in the
records of CECity under the paid time off plans of CECity that has not been
cashed out on or before the Closing Date and provide that, with respect to
each Transferred Employee, for a period of not less than two (2)
years following the Closing Date, the rate of accrual of hours of vacation or
other paid-time-off for employment with Buyer or its Affiliates after the
Closing shall not be less than such rate of accrual with CECity immediately
prior to the Closing taking into account the Transferred EmployeeÂ’s aggregate
period of service with CECity.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any
Benefit Plan (ii) provide, or be deemed to provide, any Person not a party to
this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Benefit
Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

Section 6.6 _Post-Closing Access to Information_.

 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, except as
prohibited by applicable Law, CECity and Buyer shall, subject to compliance
by the other with the provisions of Section 6.7, (i) preserve and retain all
corporate, accounting legal, auditing and other books and records, documents
and information of CECity and CECity Subsidiary relating to the assets or
properties of CECity or CECity Subsidiary or the conduct of the Business prior
to the Closing Date (collectively, " _Information_ ") and (ii) afford to
Shareholders and to the Representative of Shareholders (A) reasonable access
and duplicating rights (with copying costs to be borne by the Shareholders)
during normal business hours to all Information and (B) reasonable access to
(through in-person meetings or otherwise) officers and employees of Buyer and
its Affiliates on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations
with respect to such Information, to obtain additional information, to call
such officers and employees as witnesses and for 

 



32  any other reasonable business purposes, insofar in each case as such access
is reasonably required for legitimate business reasons; _provided_ , _however_
, that Buyer shall not be required to disclose any Information if it believes
in good faith that doing so presents a significant risk, based on an opinion
of counsel (which can be inside counsel) of resulting in a loss of the ability
to successfully assert a claim of Privilege _provided_ , _further_ , that the
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information without resulting in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of Privilege; provided, that such Shareholders
and their Representatives shall treat all such information as confidential in
accordance with Section 6.7.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, each Shareholders and Guarantor shall provide
assistance to the Buyer and its authorized Representatives, during normal
business hours, to the extent reasonably necessary for the Buyer or its
Affiliates to comply with the reporting obligations required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, NASDAQ, the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding CECity and CECity Subsidiary,
including the operations thereof, with respect to the periods prior to the
Closing Date and/or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(relating to periods prior to the Closing Date).

Section 6.7 _Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges that the information being
provided to it prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference, which Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate upon the Closing. On and after the Closing, each Shareholder
and Guarantor (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges that the
trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information and data of
CECity (collectively, " _Confidential Information_ ") are the property of
CECity and agrees that CECity has a protectable interest in such Confidential
Information. Therefore, the Shareholder and the Guarantor agrees that it shall
not, and it shall cause its Affiliates to not, disclose to any unauthorized
person or make use of any such Confidential Information without the prior
written consent of Buyer; provided, however, that Confidential Information
shall not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure, in violation of this
Agreement, by the Shareholder or the Guarantor or its Affiliates or their
authorized representatives, (b) is or becomes available to the Shareholder or
the Guarantor or its Affiliates or their authorized representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source not reasonably known by such party to be
bound by an obligation or duty of confidentiality, (c) is independently
developed by the Shareholder or the Guarantor or its Affiliates or their
authorized representatives after the Closing without use of any of the
Confidential Information or (d) is required to be disclosed by judicial
process or Law (but only after Shareholder or Guarantor has, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided Buyer with reasonable notice and
opportunity to take action against any legally required disclosure).

 

Section 6.8 _Non-Compete Covenant_. From the Closing Date until the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Restricted Period_
"), each of the Shareholders and the Guarantors shall not, and shall not
permit any Affiliate of such Shareholder or Guarantor to, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer or on behalf of CECity
and/or its Affiliates, (a) own or control any interest in (except as a passive
investor of less than two percent (2%) of the capital stock or publicly traded
notes or debentures of a 

 



33  publicly held company), (b) act as an officer, employee, consultant,
independent contractor, agent, director, partner, member, or joint venturer
of, (c) lend credit or money for the purpose of establishing or operating, or
(d) allow such PersonÂ’s name or reputation to be used by any other Person that
is engaged in, directly or indirectly, any line of business that competes with
the Business, anywhere in North America (a " _Competitor_ "). In addition,
during the Restricted Period each of the Shareholders and the Guarantors shall
not, and shall not permit any Affiliate of such Shareholder or Guarantor to,
directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence any Person who is a
contracting party with CECity or any Business Affiliate to terminate or
adversely amend any existing written or oral agreement of CECity or such
Business Affiliate. Each Shareholder and Guarantor acknowledges that CECity
conducts, and CECity and any Business Affiliate will continue to conduct, the
Business throughout North America and this Section 6.8 therefore shall be
effective throughout North America.

 

Section 6.9 _Non-Solicitation Covenant_. During the Restricted Period, each of
the Shareholders and the Guarantors shall not, and shall not permit any
Affiliate of such Shareholder or Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, in any
manner (whether on his, her or its own account, as an owner, operator,
manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent
or otherwise), without the prior written consent of Buyer or on behalf of
CECity and/or its Affiliates, (a) call upon, solicit or provide services to
any Competitor with the intent of selling or attempting to sell any products
or provide any services that compete with those manufactured or provided by
CECity or any Business Affiliate, (b) (i) (x) hire or engage or recruit,
solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or engage or (y) enter into any
business relationship related to the Business with, any other Person employed
by CECity or any Business Affiliate, or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any
such Person to leave such employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that commencing
on the date which is the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, this
Section 6.9(b)(ii) shall not apply to any of the foregoing actions described
in Section 6.9(b)(ii) taken by any of Lloyd Myers, Simone Karp or Andrew Rabin
with respect to either of such other two Persons, (c) in any way take actions
that could reasonably be expected to interfere with the relationship between
CECity or any Business Affiliate and any network, customer, supplier, sales
representative, broker, licensee or other business relation of CECity or any
Business Affiliate with respect to the Business (including, without
limitation, by making any negative or disparaging statements or communications
regarding CECity or its Affiliates, or any of their operations,
officers, directors or investors), or (d) recommend, or provide any reference
to a third party for, any employee of CECity or any Business Affiliate,
provided that the restrictions of this Section 6.9 shall not apply to (i) an
employee of CECity or a Business Affiliate that responds to a solicitation of
general circulation not specifically targeted at such employee or (ii) a
former employee of CECity or any Business Affiliate thereof so long as such
former employee has not been employed by CECity or such Business Affiliate
thereof that for at least six (6) months from the date of solicitation.

 

Section 6.10 _Reasonable Restrictions_. Each Shareholder and Guarantor
represents and warrants (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) to Buyer,
and acknowledges and agrees, that: (a) such Shareholder or Guarantor has
carefully read and understands Section 6.7, Section 6.8 and Section 6.9 of
this Agreement and has had the opportunity for such sections to be reviewed
by counsel; (b) acknowledges that the duration, geographical scope and subject
matter of Section 6.7, Section 6.8 and Section 6.9 of this Agreement are
reasonable and necessary to protect the goodwill, customer relationships,
legitimate business interests, trade secrets and confidential and

 



34  proprietary information of CECity; (c) acknowledges that Buyer would not
have closed the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
benefits contained in Section 6.7, Section 6.8 and Section 6.9 of this
Agreement, and that the Shareholder or Guarantor is receiving, directly or
indirectly, substantial consideration in connection with the Closing as a
result of the sale of the goodwill of CECity to Buyer; (d) will be able to
earn a satisfactory livelihood without violating this Agreement; and (e)
understands that this Agreement is assignable by Buyer and shall inure to the
benefit of its respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 6.11 _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that with respect to CECity
certain consents and approvals to, and licenses to be obtained in connection
with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from
certain third parties, and that such consents, approvals and licenses have not
been and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that neither CECity nor
the Shareholders shall have any liability whatsoever arising out of or
relating to, the failure to obtain any such consents, approvals or licenses
that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default under or
acceleration or termination of any Contracts or Permits or other right or
obligation, as a result thereof (including, in each case, any loss of revenue,
customers or employees and any Action commenced or threatened by any Person
with respect to any such failure, default, acceleration or termination). Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation
of CECity or the Shareholders contained herein shall be breached or
deemed breached, and no condition to BuyerÂ’s obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied, as
a result of the failure to obtain any such consent, approval or license or as
a result of any such default, acceleration or termination. Buyer also
acknowledges that, during the negotiation and due diligence phases of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, CECity or the Shareholders or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives may have affirmatively
disclosed confidential information and/or agreements to Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives, which disclosures may have been in violation
of applicable confidentiality restrictions providing for protection of
the disclosed information. Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, CECity and the Shareholders and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives shall not have any liability whatsoever to
Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) arising out of or relating to any such
disclosure. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of CECity or any Shareholder contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate or breached or deemed inaccurate or breached, and no condition
shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of any such disclosure. Prior to
the Closing, CECity shall, upon the request of Buyer, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any such material consents and waivers contemplated by this
Section 6.11; _provided_ , _however_ , that such efforts shall not include any
requirement that CECity or any of its Affiliates expend material amounts of
money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant
any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

Section 6.12 _Disclosure Schedule Updates_. If CECity or any of the
Shareholders becomes aware of, or there occurs, after the date of this
Agreement any fact or condition that renders any representation or warranty
made by any of the Shareholders or CECity in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE
IV, respectively, untrue or if any fact or condition requires any change in
the Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer at the time of execution of this
Agreement,

 



35  CECity and the Shareholders will have the right, at their election, to
deliver to Buyer not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing a
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying any needed change; provided
that such updates shall relate only to actions, omissions or events that are
not specifically prohibited by Section 6.1 of this Agreement. Any such
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule shall not be given effect for purposes
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(d); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule shall be given
effect for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty for purposes of the indemnification provisions
under Section 9.4(a).

Section 6.13  _Resignations_. CECity and the Shareholders shall cause the
officers and directors of each CECity and CECity Subsidiary, to the extent
specified in writing by Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, to resign such position or positions, effective as of the
Closing.

Section 6.14 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
articles of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement (or
similar organizational documents) of CECity and CECity Subsidiary to contain
provisions relating to the exculpation and indemnification of former officers
and directors/managers (or equivalent governance positionholders)
(the "Covered Persons") no less beneficial to the Covered Persons as set
forth in such organizational documents as of the Closing Date, unless required
by applicable Law, it being the intent of the parties that the officers
and directors/managers (and equivalent governance positionholders) of CECity
or CECity Subsidiary prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall maintain the
cyber/professional liability insurance coverage with respect to the products
and services of CECity (regardless of whether sold before or after the
Closing) upon such terms, conditions, and levels and covering such Persons as
are at least equal to the coverage historically maintained by CECity.

 

Section 6.15 _Shareholders Â’ Representative_.

 

(a) Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints Lloyd
N. Myers as the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and as his, her or its exclusive

foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of such
Shareholder or other Person under any circumstance.

Representative to act as agent of each Shareholder, and shall not be liable in
any way whatsoever for any action Buyer takes or omits to take in reliance

of attorney under this Agreement are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable by any Shareholder in any manner and for any reason. This agency,
proxy and power of attorney shall not be affected by the death, disability,
incapacity or bankruptcy of the Shareholder pursuant to any applicable law or
otherwise. Each Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that upon execution of
this Agreement, any delivery by the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative of any
waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other documents executed
by the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative or any decisions made by the ShareholdersÂ’
Representative pursuant to this Section 6.15, such Shareholder shall be bound

as the case may be, a majority of the outstanding Shares of
CECity immediately prior to the Closing. Each Shareholder agrees that Mr.
Myers or his successor may be removed from serving as ShareholdersÂ’
Representative by a vote of the Shareholders who hold or held, as the case may
be, a majority of the outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Closing.

(e) Under no circumstances shall ShareholdersÂ’ Representative have
any liability, under any fiduciary theory or otherwise, to the Shareholders
for any act or omission to act of ShareholdersÂ’ Representative in such
capacity, unless the Shareholder asserting such liability is able to prove
that ShareholdersÂ’ Representative was guilty of gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Shareholder shall, severally but not jointly and on a _pro
rata_ basis based upon their respective Pro Rata Portion of the Shares, (i)
indemnify, save and hold harmless ShareholdersÂ’ Representative from and
against any and all Losses incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from, or incident to any act or omission to act of the

 



37  ShareholdersÂ’ Representative in his capacity as such, except to the extent
caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of the
ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and (ii) reimburse ShareholdersÂ’ Representative
for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants and experts) incurred by ShareholdersÂ’ Representative
in connection with performing his duties as ShareholdersÂ’ Representative
hereunder.

Section 6.16 _No Solicitation_. Until the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, CECity, the
Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative shall, and shall cause their
respective directors, managers, officers, employees, independent contractors,
agents, trustees, beneficiaries, advisors and other representatives
(collectively, the " _CECity Representatives_ ") to, cease any existing

Affiliates) conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any proposed,
potential or contemplated Competing Transaction, and CECity, the Shareholders
and the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall not, and CECity, the Shareholders

any negotiations or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal to
acquire all or any portion of CECityÂ’s business or assets, or any equity
interest in CECity or shares of CECity or any rights to acquire any shares
of CECity or other equity interests in CECity, regardless of the form of
transaction (a " _Competing Transaction_ "), or effect any such Competing
Transaction, (b) disclose any information to any Person concerning the
business or assets of CECity, or afford to any Person access to CECityÂ’s
assets, books or records other than in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement,
(c) assist or cooperate with any Person to make any proposal regarding a
Competing Transaction, or (d) enter into any agreement with any Person
providing for a Competing Transaction. In the event that CECity, any

shall receive, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.2_ hereof, any
offer, proposal, or request of the type referenced in clause (a), (c) or (d)
above, or any request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (b)
above, CECity, the Shareholders and the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall, or
shall cause such CECity Representative to, (x) immediately terminate, suspend
or otherwise discontinue any and all discussions or other negotiations with
such Person with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y)
promptly notify Buyer of the receipt thereof. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in Section 6.16 by (i) any Shareholder or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative or
any stockholder, member, or any agent, representative or affiliate of thereof
or (ii) any officer, manager, agent, representative or affiliate of CECity,

or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, as applicable.

 

Section 6.17 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each of the Shareholders
and Guarantors, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their successors
and assigns, shall knowingly and irrevocably release and forever discharge
CECity and CECity Subsidiary, their successors and assigns and their
respective directors, managers, and officers (individually, a " _Releasee_ "
and collectively, " _Releasees_ ") from any and all Actions, orders,
obligations, contracts, debts, liabilities and obligations of any nature
(whether absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, 

 



38  known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and whether or
not accrued) that any Shareholder or Guarantor or any of its Affiliates or
their successors and assigns now has, has ever had or may hereafter have
against the respective Releasees arising contemporaneously with or before the
Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event
occurring contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date, in each case
other than any obligations of Buyer arising under this Agreement or Buyer or
CECity under any other Transaction Document (collectively, the " _Released
Claims_ "). Each of the Shareholders and Guarantors, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates and their successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably covenants
to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or

ARTICLE VII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 7.1 _Procedures Related to Tax Audits_. If any pending or threatened
audit, adjustment, assessment, examination or proceeding (whether judicial or
administrative) (a " _Tax Audit_ ") commenced or initiated against CECity,
CECity Subsidiary or Buyer by any Tax Authority after the Closing Date, would,
if successful, require the Shareholders to make an indemnity payment pursuant
to Section 9.4 or otherwise affect any liability of Shareholders for Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall give the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative
prompt written notice of such Tax Audit (which in any event shall be within
fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of such Tax Audit); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to provide notice shall not relieve the Shareholders
from any indemnity obligations except to the extent the Shareholders were
actually prejudiced by the failure to give notice. With respect to any Tax
Audit which relates solely to Taxes for which the Shareholders would be
required to make an indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.4 or
the liability of the Shareholders for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
the Shareholders shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon timely
written notice, to elect to control, defend, settle, compromise, or contest
such Tax Audit;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, (i) the Shareholders shall keep Buyer fully
informed of any proceedings, events and developments related to or in
connection with such Tax Audit; (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to receive
copies of all correspondence and documents related to such Tax Audit; (iii)
the Shareholders shall consult with Buyer and shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Tax Audit without BuyerÂ’s prior written
consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; (iv)
at its own cost and expense, Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but
not control) the defense of such Tax Audit; and (v) the ShareholdersÂ’ right
to assume such control shall be

 



39  subject to, and conditioned on, their acknowledgement in writing of the
ShareholdersÂ’ obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement for Taxes ultimately determined to be payable
by CECity or CECity Subsidiary as a result of such Tax Claim. Except as
provided in clause (iv) above, the costs and expenses (including the cost of
counsel) incurred in contesting any such Tax Audit which ShareholdersÂ’ elect
to control shall be borne by the Shareholders. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
cooperate with the Shareholders in pursuing such Tax Audit. If the Buyer
controls any Tax Audit relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall
control such Tax Audit but shall provide the Shareholders the same rights that
Buyer would have pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) above if the
Shareholders had elected to control such Tax Audit.

 

Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer shall pay to the appropriate Tax Authority any and all
excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer),
stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes arising
directly or indirectly as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any interest, additions to tax, or penalties
applicable or related thereto (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer shall, at its own
expense, properly complete, sign, and timely file any and all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to such Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable Law, the Shareholders will join in the execution of any such Tax
Return.

 

Section 7.3 _Mutual Cooperation_. The Shareholders and Buyer will cooperate
with each other in paying any material Taxes, filing any material Tax Return,
and conducting any Tax Audit contemplated by this Agreement and, except as set
forth to the contrary in this Agreement, shall take such action as the other
party may reasonably request including the following: (a) provide data and
other reasonably requested Tax materials and information necessary for the
preparation of any material Tax Return, including schedules, and make any
elections that reasonably may be required by the other party; (b) file
protests or otherwise contest any proposed or asserted material Tax
deficiencies, including filing petitions for redetermination or prosecuting
actions for refund in any court, and pursuing the appeal of any such actions;
(c) execute material Tax Returns or other documents reasonably required by
the other party; and (d) execute such powers of attorney as are reasonably
requested and required by the Shareholders or any of the ShareholdersÂ’
Affiliates or Buyer or any of BuyerÂ’s Affiliates on behalf of, as the case
may be, Buyer or any of BuyerÂ’s Affiliates or the Shareholders or any of the
ShareholdersÂ’ Affiliates to enable the requesting party to represent the other
party in a Tax Audit involving a Tax for which the requesting party is liable
under applicable Law. The Shareholders and Buyer hereby agree to reimburse
each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (excluding officersÂ’ or
employeesÂ’ salaries and general corporate overhead and other similar
expenses) incurred by the other in connection with satisfying its obligations
under this Section 7.3.

Section 7.4  _Maintenance of Books and Records_. Until the applicable statute
of limitation (including periods of waiver) has expired for any Tax Return
filed or required to be filed covering the periods up to and including the
Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall retain all Tax work papers and
related materials in its possession and under its control that were used in
the preparation of any such Tax Return. Buyer will notify the Shareholders
sixty (60) days prior to disposing of any Tax records relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and will deliver to the
Shareholders any such records requested by the Shareholders.

 



40 Section 7.5 _Post-Closing Actions_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, Buyer, CECity and CECity Subsidiary shall not amend any previously filed
Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, file Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period in a jurisdiction where CECity or CECity Subsidiary, as applicable,
has not historically filed Tax Returns, initiate discussions or examinations
with any Tax Authority regarding Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, or change any accounting method or adopt any convention that
shifts taxable income from a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the
Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or shifts deductions or losses from a
Pre-Closing Tax Period to a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the
Closing Date, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, Buyer
shall cause each of CECity and CECity Subsidiary to carry on its business
only in the ordinary course in the same manner as previously conducted.

 

Section 7.6 _Refunds_. Any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of Taxes,
including any interest received from a Tax Authority thereon, attributable to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period of CECity and CECity Subsidiary shall be for the
account of the Shareholders (excluding any refund or credit attributable to
any loss in a tax year (or portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after the
Closing Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to income in a tax year (or
portion of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date). Within
fifteen (15) days) of any receipt by CECity, CECity Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of any such refund (or credit for overpayment), Buyer shall pay
over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, any such refund (or the
amount of any such credit), including any interest thereon, net of any
reasonable costs or expenses, including Taxes, of CECity, CECity Subsidiary,
Buyer, or any Buyer Affiliate attributable to such refund or credit, to the
Shareholders. Buyer shall take any commercially reasonable action necessary
for CECity and CECity Subsidiary to promptly claim refunds attributable to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and cause CECity and CECity Subsidiary to claim
refunds attributable to any such Tax period within the statutorily required
time period. Under this Section 7.6, the following shall be the treatment
of the Pennsylvania Research and Development Tax Credit (the " _R andD
Credit_") of CECity attributable to expenditures of CECity made prior to
Closing for Pennsylvania tax purposes: (i) the RandD Credit shall be utilized
to reduce the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax liability of CECity in 2014 and
2015 for the period prior to the Closing to the greatest extent possible, (ii)
any RandD Credit in excess of (i) shall be allocated to offset the
Pennsylvania personal income tax liability of the Shareholders for their 2014
tax year to the extent of such liability, and (iii) any RandD credit in excess
of (i) and (ii) shall be allocated to offset the Pennsylvania personal income
tax liability of the Shareholders for their 2015 tax years.

Section 7.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 2.1, Buyer
shall pay to the Shareholders the amount of additional consideration
necessary to cause ShareholdersÂ’ after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the
ShareholdersÂ’ stock to Buyer with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal
to the after-Tax net proceeds that the Shareholders would have received had
the Section 338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into account all
appropriate state, federal and local Tax implications including the federal,
state and local income Taxes of the Shareholders arising from
and attributable to

 



41  ShareholdersÂ’ receipt of such additional consideration from Buyer (the "
_Tax Adjustment_ "). The ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall provide to Buyer
for BuyerÂ’s review and approval a schedule computing in reasonable detail the
amount of the Tax Adjustment no later than fifteen (15) days following the
determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3. The Buyer
shall have fifteen (15) days to review the computation of the Tax Adjustment
delivered by the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative and if the Buyer raise no
objections within such fifteen (15) day period, the Tax Adjustment shall be
deemed final and agreed. If the Buyer disagrees with the Tax Adjustment
delivered by the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, the Buyer shall object in
writing to the Tax Adjustment within such fifteen (15) day period, and the
Buyer and the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any such objection (and all such discussions related thereto shall be
governed by Rule 408 of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, and any
applicable similar state rule and evidence of such discussions shall not be
admissible in any future proceedings between the parties), provided that if
after twenty (20) days the Buyer and the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative have not
reached agreement, then either party shall have the right to submit any
remaining disputed items following the expiration of such 20-day period to an
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing, mutually agreed
to by Buyer and the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative (the " _338 Accountant_ "),
for final resolution. The 338 Accountant shall calculate, based solely on the
written submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and ShareholdersÂ’
Representative, on the other hand, and not by independent investigation,
the Tax Adjustment and shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be
made in accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement
(including the methodology set forth on Section 7.7(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule), and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the
range of values established for such amount as determined by reference to the
value assigned to such amount by Buyer in its objection notice and by
ShareholdersÂ’ Representative in its notice regarding the Tax Adjustment. In
making its determination, the 338 Accountant shall act as an expert and not as
an arbitrator. All fees and expenses of the 338 Accountant shall be borne
equally the Shareholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The
Tax Adjustment, as finally agreed or determined by the 338 Accountant (in the
absence of fraud or manifest error), will be binding on all of the Parties.
The amount of the Tax Adjustment shall be paid to the Shareholders on or
prior to January 15, 2016; provided, however, that if at if the Buyer and the
ShareholdersÂ’ Representative have not finally determined the Tax Adjustment
prior to January 15, 2016, the Buyer shall make a good faith estimate of the
Tax Adjustment and pay such amount to the Shareholders on January 15, 2016,
which amount shall be subject to adjustment upon final resolution of the Tax
Adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.7(a).

 

(b) The Shareholders shall join with Buyer in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or local Tax
Law) with respect to the purchase of the Shares (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_"). The Shareholders agree (i) to provide Buyer with any
information reasonably requested by Buyer to analyze the Tax costs associated
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, (ii) to reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in determining the amount of the Tax Adjustment, (iii) to provide Buyer with
any information reasonably requested by Buyer to permit the Section
338(h)(10) Election to be made, and (iv) to take all actions

 



42  reasonably requested by Buyer to effect and preserve timely the Section
338(h)(10) Election (including, filing such forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents reasonably requested by Buyer to effect and
preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (or any comparable
provisions under state or local Tax Law)). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Shareholders will furnish to Buyer, at any time as
reasonably requested by Buyer, any information requested by Buyer in order to
prepare IRS Form 8023 (and, as applicable, analogous forms required
under state or local Tax Law) and will, at the Closing or at any time
thereafter as requested by Buyer, execute any IRS Form 8023 (and any such
analogous forms) prepared by Buyer and deliver such IRS Form 8023 (and any
such analogous forms) to Buyer for filing. Following the Closing,
Shareholders will take any and all other actions, and execute and deliver to
Buyer any and all forms and documents, that Buyer may reasonably determine to
be necessary or appropriate to give full effect to the Section 338(h)(10)
Election for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes to the fullest
extent permitted by Law.

 

(c) The Final Purchase Price, Liabilities of CECity and other relevant items
(including, for example and without limitation, any adjustments or additions
to the Final Purchase Price) will be allocated for income Tax purposes among
the assets of CECity that are deemed to have been acquired pursuant to the
Section 338(h)(10) Election by Buyer, in accordance with Section 338 of the
Code and the Regulations thereunder, and the methodology set forth on Section
7.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Acquisition Price Allocation_ ").
The Acquisition Price Allocation will be binding on all of the Parties, and
the Parties agree to act (and cause their respective Affiliates to act) in
accordance with the Acquisition Price Allocation in the preparation, filing
and audit of any Tax Return, including IRS Form 8883, IRS Form 8594 or
any equivalent statement.

Section 7.8 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, any Taxes based on income, revenues,
receipts or payroll shall be apportioned to that portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books,
and all other Taxes shall be apportioned to that portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date by multiplying the Taxes payable for such
Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number days in
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period;
provided that for purposes of calculating the foregoing Taxes, any exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as
depreciation) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing
Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days
in each period.

 

Section 7.9 _Tax Returns_. The Shareholders will be responsible for preparing
all income Tax Returns of CECity and CECity Subsidiary for any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date (including any short-period returns of
CECity and CECity Subsidiary for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date);
provided that such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practices of CECity and CECity Subsidiary, except as required
by applicable Law, and shall be delivered to Buyer for BuyerÂ’s review and
comment no less than forty-five (45) days prior to the filing deadline
applicable to such Tax Return, or as soon as reasonably possible if the Tax
Return is required to be filed within forty-five (45) days following

 



43  the Closing Date. Buyer will be responsible for preparing all other Tax
Returns of CECity and CECity Subsidiary, provided that for any other Tax
Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of CECity and CECity
Subsidiary, except as required by applicable Law, and each such material Tax
Return shall be delivered to Seller for SellerÂ’s review and comment no less
than twenty (20) days prior to the filing deadline applicable to such Tax
Return. Buyer and the Shareholders agree that all Transaction Tax Deductions
shall be treated as properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and all Transaction Tax Deductions
shall be included as a deduction in the Tax Returns of CECity and CECity
Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. For the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of
Closing, Buyer shall cause CECity and CECity Subsidiary to carry on the
Business only in the ordinary course of business. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause CECity and CECity Subsidiary to not, take any action, or permit any
action to be taken, that may prevent the Tax year of CECity and CECity
Subsidiary from ending for federal and state income Tax purposes as a result
of the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or prior to such date or (ii) ShareholdersÂ’ Representative if any
ShareholderÂ’s or CECityÂ’s failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 



46 (c) by ShareholdersÂ’ Representative or Buyer if any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c),
Buyer shall have fulfilled its obligations contained in Section 6.3 prior to
exercising its right to termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) and (B)
if ShareholdersÂ’ Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to this

(d) by Buyer upon written notice to ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, if there
shall have been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of CECity, the
Shareholders or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative which has rendered the
satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 8.3 incapable of
satisfaction, such violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer, and the
breach has not been cured within 30 days following BuyerÂ’s written notice of
such breach and is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(d), if not exercised, shall terminate 60 days following delivery
of such written notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to Buyer if it

other agreement contained herein;

(e) by ShareholdersÂ’ Representative upon written notice to Buyer, if there
shall have been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer which

(f) by ShareholdersÂ’ Representative upon written notice to Buyer, if Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section
8.3 (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
the Closing ( _provided_ such conditions would have been satisfied as of such
date) or the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a
breach by Buyer of its representations, warranties,

 



47  covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement); _provided_ , _further_
that Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement during such three
(3) Business Day period pursuant to this Section 9.1;

(g) by Buyer upon written notice to ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, if CECity
and the Shareholders fail to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business

and Section 8.2 (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such conditions would have been

ShareholdersÂ’ Representative of their representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement); _provided_ , _further_ that
ShareholdersÂ’ Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
during such three (3) Business Day period pursuant to this Section 9.1;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that neither Buyer, on the
one hand, nor ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, on the other hand, shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) during the
pendency of a legal proceeding by CECity or a Shareholder, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, respectively, for specific performance pursuant to
Section 10.7.

Section 9.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties, and, except as set

no effect and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned;
_provided_ that if (x) such termination shall (I) result from the Intentional
Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein or (II) occur following an Intentional Breach or (y) the Intentional
Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein shall cause the Closing not to occur, then such breaching party shall
be fully liable for any and all damages incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of such failure or breach. If this Agreement is terminated
as provided herein:

 

(a) each party hereto will redeliver, and will cause its Representatives

48 Section 9.3 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing
and shall thereupon terminate on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the representations and warranties contained
in  _Section 3.1 (Title to Shares)_, _Section 3.2 (Authority Relative to
this Agreement, Etc.)_, _Section 4.1 (Organization; Capitalization)_,
_Section 4.2 (Authority Relative to this Agreement, Etc.)_,  _Section 5.1
(Corporate Organization and Standing)_, and _Section 5.2 (Authority Relative
to this Agreement, Etc.)_ (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_
") and any actual fraud knowingly and willfully committed by CECity, any
Shareholder or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative, with the specific intent to
deceive and mislead Buyer or its Affiliates (" _Fraud_ "), shall survive the
Closing and thereupon shall terminate on the seven year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (b) the representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.14(e) (Intellectual Property)_ (collectively, the " _IP Representations_ ")
shall survive the Closing and thereupon shall terminate on the twenty-four

contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose
obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ ,

Taxes shall survive the Closing and thereupon shall terminate on the seven
year anniversary of the Closing Date. All other covenants and agreements

Section 9.4 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to Section 9.3 and this Section
9.4, the Shareholders shall jointly and severally, from the Escrow Fund and
up to the balance of the Escrow Amount available, and thereafter severally and
not jointly, directly from the Shareholders, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer and BuyerÂ’s Affiliates and their officers, directors,
partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Losses arising out of (i) the failure of the Shareholders, the
Guarantors or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative to duly perform or comply with
any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by the
Shareholders, the Guarantors or the ShareholdersÂ’ Representative pursuant to
this Agreement (the remedy for which survives the Closing), (ii) any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of (A) any representation or warranty
of the Shareholders set forth in ARTICLE III or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf thereof or (B) any representation or
warranty of CECity set forth in ARTICLE IV or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf thereof, and (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the Shareholders shall not have any liability
under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such
Loss relates to action or inaction by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates after the Closing Date (other than to the extent such liability
reasonably relates to the pre-Closing actions or inactions of CECity or the
Shareholders). Buyer shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach which gives rise to the Loss.

 



49 (b) From and after the Closing, and subject to Section 9.3 and this Section
9.4, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders and each
of their respective Affiliates and their agents, representatives, heirs,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Shareholder Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any Losses arising out of (i) the failure of Buyer to duly
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied
with by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (the remedy for which survives the
Closing) or (ii) any breach of any representation of Buyer set forth in
ARTICLE V or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf
thereof. The Shareholders acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall not have any liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such Loss relates
to action or inaction by the Shareholders after the Closing Date. The
Shareholders shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any
Loss upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to,
or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss.

(c) Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Section 9.4 (including for
purposes of determining the amount of Losses for purposes of sub-sections (h)
and (i) below) shall be (i) net of any insurance or other third party recovery
made by or available to the Indemnified Party (whether paid directly to such
Indemnified Party or assigned by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified
Party) (net of all costs and expenses and any retroactive or other premium
increases incurred in connection therewith) and (ii) reduced to take account
of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
deductibility of any such Losses in the taxable year in which, or in the
taxable year after which, such Losses are incurred. The amount of any increase
or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect any final
resolution with respect to the Indemnified PartyÂ’s liability for Taxes and, if
necessary, the Shareholders or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make payments
to the other to reflect such adjustment. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, for Tax purposes. Each of the
parties shall notify the other parties if it receives notice that any Tax
Authority proposes to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as
other than an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes. A party
(and its Affiliates) shall not be deemed to have suffered a "Loss" with
respect to an item to the extent such party was actually compensated therefor
by reason of an increase in the amount otherwise paid to it or a reduction in
the amount otherwise paid by it pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

 

(d) No Action or claim for Losses subject to indemnification under this
Section 9.4 with respect to a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall be brought or made
after the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall terminate pursuant to Section 9.3, regardless of when the facts
underlying such claim are first discovered; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
claim made after the Closing and prior to such termination date with
reasonable specificity by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
shall survive (and be subject to indemnification) until it is finally and
fully resolved.

 



50 (e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no indemnity may
be sought hereunder in respect of (i) any Losses to the extent such Liability
(A) is reflected as a liability or reserve in the Financial Statements or (B)
was taken into account in determining the Final Net Working Capital, or (ii)
any claim for breach of any representation or warranty of CECity or any
Shareholder if (A) such claim is based on a fact or an event occurring prior
to Closing (whether or not also occurring prior to the date of this Agreement)
and (B) either (I) such fact or event was disclosed by CECity or any
Shareholder or their Affiliates in this Agreement, including the Disclosure
Schedule, or (II) prior to the date hereof, Keith Figlioli, Jeffrey Lemkin or
Kris Karson knew of such fact or event and, with respect to such fact or
event, a reasonable person would understand the general magnitude of such fact
or event.

 

(f) (i) Upon receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified
Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice from a third party of any
action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment against such Indemnified
Party which might give rise to a claim for Losses under this Section 9.4, the
Indemnified Party (or a Shareholder or Buyer on behalf of an Indemnified
Party) shall promptly give written notice thereof to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") setting forth, with
reasonable specificity, the nature of and facts underlying each particular
claim (including identification of all particular sections of this Agreement
pursuant to which indemnification is being sought), a copy of any
documentation received from the third party and an estimate of the Losses
relating thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice
shall not eliminate the right to indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of
such failure. For the avoidance of doubt, notice by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party will not be made or include notification (formal or
informal, written or oral) to any other Person or Governmental Authority,
other than as specifically agreed in writing between the Parties. Payments
for Losses for Third Party Claims which are otherwise covered by the
indemnification obligations herein shall not be required except to the extent
that the Indemnified Party has expended out-of-pocket sums. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of, at its
own expense and by its own counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, any such matter as to which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification hereunder (other than a claim in which a Buyer Indemnified
Party is the Indemnified Party and such claim entails reputational rights in
BuyerÂ’s reasonable judgment (including any claims regarding qui tam/False
Claims Act or the regulation of securities)). If the Indemnifying Party
shall, in accordance with the preceding sentence, undertake to compromise or
defend any such asserted liability, it shall notify the Indemnified Party of
its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall agree to cooperate
fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or
defense against, any such asserted liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not cease defending such claim or settle any
such asserted liability without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement expressly and
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such matter
and provides relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding an election of the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to 

 



51  employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of one such separate counsel pursuant to the preceding sentence in
each jurisdiction (and shall pay such fees, costs and expenses at least
quarterly), if, but only if, (1) the defendants in, or targets of, any such
action or proceeding include both an Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on
the advice of counsel, that there is a material conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to
such proceeding (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the
Indemnified Party) or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to represent such
Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of
such action or proceeding or shall have ceased defending such action or
proceeding. In any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel and shall not assert any
position in any proceeding inconsistent with that reasonably asserted by the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake to compromise or defend any
Third Party Claim or ceases to defend any Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 9.4(f)(i), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume,
conduct and control the defense in good faith and to compromise and settle the
claim in good faith and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all
reasonable costs, expenses, settlement amounts or other Losses paid or
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of
a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnifying Party may, at its option, elect at any time
to assume and control the defense against such Third Party Claim. Except as
otherwise set forth herein, the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s decision to allow the
Indemnified Party to take the lead with respect to any indemnity obligation of
the Indemnifying Party shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with
respect to any such indemnity obligation, and if an Indemnified Party settles
a Third Party Claim it is defending pursuant to this Section 9.4(f)(ii)
without obtaining the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s written consent to such settlement
in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect to such Third Party Claim. Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any
Third Party Claim or cease to defend against such claim, if pursuant to or as
a result of such settlement or cessation, (A) injunctive relief or specific
performance would be imposed against the Indemnified Party, or (B) such
settlement or cessation would impose a material amount of liability or create
any financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party for
which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(iii) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a
claim

 



52  by a third party, promptly after becoming aware of any facts or
circumstances which the Indemnified Party believes have given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party in writing setting forth, with reasonable specificity,
the nature of and facts underlying each particular claim
(including identification of all particular sections of this Agreement
pursuant to which indemnification is being sought) and an estimate of the
Losses relating thereto. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in the appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) The indemnification provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (other than injunctive relief or specific performance as
contemplated by Section 10.7) following the Closing with respect to any breach
or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, agreement, covenant
or any other obligation contained in this Agreement, (ii) shall apply without
regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of set-off,
limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be comprehensive and not to
be limited by any requirements of Law concerning prominence of language or
waiver of any legal right under any Law (including rights under any workers
compensation statute or similar statute conferring immunity from suit). In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby knowingly and irrevocably and
forever discharges and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights
of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which
exist or may arise in the future, that it or its successors and assigns may
have against each of the Shareholders or any of their Affiliates or Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including CECity and CECity Subsidiary, as the case
may be, arising contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date under or
based upon any Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters
(including Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon any securities
Law, common Law or otherwise), in each case other than obligations of such
party arising under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The
obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 9.4 shall be conditioned
upon the Closing having occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns be
entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Losses, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) against
any third party in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates. Such
Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party will execute
upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further
perfect such subrogation rights.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Shareholders shall not be required to provide indemnification for Losses
under Section 9.4(a)(ii) to the

 



53  Buyer Indemnified Parties (i) for any individual item or series of related
items based on a similar set of operative facts, where the Loss relating
thereto is less than One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($100,000) (the " _De
Minimis Claim Threshold_ ") or (ii) in respect of any individual item where
the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Claim
Threshold, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, with respect to such items (in the aggregate)
exceeds $4,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the obligation to provide
indemnification under Section 9.4(a)(ii) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall only apply with respect to such amounts that are in excess of the
Basket.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (A) subject to
Section 9.4(j), the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may
be recovered from the Shareholders and the Guarantors pursuant to Section
9.4(a) shall in no event exceed $40,000,000 (such aggregate amount being the
" _Cap_ "), (B) the maximum amount of any indemnifiable Losses that may be
recovered from any Shareholder pursuant to Section 9.4(a)(ii)(B) or Section
9.4(a)(iii) shall in no event exceed an amount equal to such ShareholderÂ’s Pro
Rata Portion of such Losses, and (C) in no event shall any Shareholder or
Guarantor have any obligation to indemnify for any Losses pursuant to (x)
Section 9.4(a)(ii)(A) to the extent such Losses did not arise out of a breach
of any representation set forth in Article III made by such Shareholder, or
(y) Section 9.4(a)(i) with respect to the failure of such Shareholder or
Guarantor (unless as a result of the failure of its respective Guaranteed
Shareholder) to duly perform or comply with the covenants or agreements
described in Sections 6.7 through 6.9 to be performed or complied with by such
Shareholder or Guarantor (or respective Guaranteed Shareholder); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that foregoing provisions of subsections (B) and (C) shall not
affect the BuyerÂ’s right to seek indemnification on a joint and several basis
under the Escrow Agreement.

(j) Notwithstanding Section 9.4(i)(A), the Cap amount shall not apply to
Losses in connection with the following items: (i) any misrepresentation,
breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representations; (ii) any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any IP Representation, (iii) any
Fraud or (iv) any Pre-Closing Taxes;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Shareholders be liable for any Losses under this _Section
9.4_ or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (A) with respect to clause (i), (iii) and (iv) of this
Section 9.4(j), in excess of $200,000,000, and (B) with respect to clause (ii)
of this Section 9.4(j), in excess of $100,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Losses with respect to the matters described in this Section 9.4(j) shall
also be applied as Losses under the Cap.

(k) _Contribution_. The Shareholder Indemnified Parties shall not have any
claim for contribution from or against CECity or CECity Subsidiary as a result
of any indemnification or other payments made by the Shareholder Indemnified
Parties to any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

(l) _Guaranty by Certain Individuals and Trusts on Behalf of Trusts
and Individuals_. By joining in this Agreement, each of (i) Lloyd N. Myers
solely on behalf of the Lloyd N. Myers 2014 Trust U/T/A dated March 31, 2014
and Deborah Myers, (ii)

 



54  Deborah Myers solely on behalf of the Lloyd N. Myers 2014 Trust U/T/A dated

2013 solely on behalf of Simone F. Karp, (vi) the Henry S. Karp Remainder
Trust U/T/A dated July 17, 2013 solely on behalf of Simone F. Karp, (vii)
Andrew L. Rabin solely on behalf of the Andrew L. Rabin 2014 Trust U/T/A
dated August 29, 2014 and Rita Rabin, (viii) Rita Rabin solely on behalf of
the Andrew L. Rabin 2014 Trust U/T/A dated August 29, 2014 and Andrew L.
Rabin, (ix) the Andrew L. Rabin 2014 Trust U/T/A dated August 29, 2014 solely
on behalf of Andrew L. Rabin and Rita Rabin, (x) Zoel Silverman solely on
behalf of Bonnie Silverman, and (xi) Bonnie Silverman solely on behalf of Zoel
Silverman (each, a " _Guarantor_ "), guarantees to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties the full and prompt payment and performance (not just collection) by
the respective trust or individual named above for such Person (each such
trust, a " _Guaranteed Shareholder_ "), all of such Guaranteed ShareholderÂ’s
covenants and obligations under this Agreement and any ancillary agreements,
and further agrees to be bound by the obligations pursuant to Sections 6.7
through 6.10 as if such Guarantor were a Guaranteed Shareholder. If such
Guaranteed Shareholder does not perform a covenant or obligation under this
Agreement or any ancillary agreement, the respective Guarantor shall promptly
perform the covenant or obligation. This guaranty of each Guarantor is an
absolute, irrevocable, primary, continuing, unconditional, and unlimited
guaranty of performance and payment subject to and within the limitations of
this Agreement, and is not a guaranty of collection. This guaranty shall
remain in full force and effect (and shall remain in effect notwithstanding
any amendment to this Agreement) for each Guarantor until all of the
obligations of the respective Guaranteed Shareholder have been paid, observed,
performed, or discharged in full.

other right.

 



55 Section 10.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the documents

the parties shall have agreed in advance with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in connection with any litigation relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement between any parties to this Agreement, this Section
10.8 shall not be applicable to such parties, and such parties shall have no
obligations under this Section 10.8, to the extent necessary in connection
with such litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing either party may make
or cause to be made any press release or similar public announcement or
communication as may be

 



57  required to comply with the requirements of any applicable Laws or the rules
and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
parties is listed; _provided_ , that to the extent in the good faith judgment
of such party it is reasonably practicable to do so, such party (x) provides
the other party with a reasonable opportunity in light of the circumstances to
review such partyÂ’s intended communication and (y) consider in good faith
modifications to the intended communication that are requested by the other
party.

evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(b) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether

execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to the personal

specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on,"

statement, to the extent any such phrase appears in such representation
or warranty, to the extent that (a) there is a reserve, accrual or other
similar item underlying a number on the face of such balance sheet or
financial statement that relates to the subject matter of such representation
or (b) such item is otherwise set forth on the face of such balance sheet or
financial statement or in the notes thereto.

regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date).

Section 10.17  _Disclosure Schedule_. Any information disclosed in any
Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed to Buyer in
another Section of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably
apparent based upon the nature of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Sections of these Disclosure Schedules
notwithstanding the absence of a cross-reference contained therein. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision
of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any
Section of the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so specified or included,
or other items or matters, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the specification of any such amount or the specification or
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any item or matter not specified herein or included in
any Section of the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter
in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the specification or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any item or matter not specified herein or included in
any Section of the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary 

 



60  course of business for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure in any
Section of the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, Law or regulation shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

Section 10.18  _Release_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer on its own behalf and
on behalf of CECity and CECity Subsidiary (each, together with Buyer, a
"Releasing Person") hereby releases and forever discharges (and, upon any
ShareholderÂ’s request, Buyer shall cause each other Releasing Person to
acknowledge and agree in writing to such release and discharge) the
Shareholders and their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns and all
of their respective current and former officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives (in each case, solely in their
capacities as such) (each, a "Released Person") from all debts, demands,
causes of action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any and all claims,
defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities whatsoever, of every
name and nature, both at Law and in equity, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, accrued or unaccrued, which have been or could have been asserted
against any Released Person, which any Releasing Person has or ever had,
which arise out of or in any way relate to events, circumstances or actions
occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of
matters relating to CECity or CECity Subsidiary; provided, however, that the
parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 10.18 does not apply to and
shall not constitute a release of any rights or obligations arising under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

Section 10.19 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of CECity or any of
the Shareholders or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
CECity, its properties and assets, the Business, the Shares, or with respect
to any other information provided, or made available, to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. None of CECity or any of the Shareholders, or any other
Person, will have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to Buyer,
its Affiliates, agents or Representatives or any Person resulting from the
sale of the Shares to Buyer or BuyerÂ’s use of, or the use by any of its
Affiliates or Representatives of any such information, including information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Buyer,
its Affiliates or Representatives in the Data Room or any teaser, the
confidential information memorandum or management presentations in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless any such
information is expressly and specifically included in a representation
or warranty contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except in the case of Fraud, the
Shareholders shall not have any liability for any representations and
warranties made with respect to CECity unless and until the Closing occurs.
Each of CECity and the Shareholders and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives disclaims any and all other representations and warranties,
whether express or implied.
