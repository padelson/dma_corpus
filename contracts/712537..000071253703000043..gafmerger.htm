accomplish that result, then the Exchange Agent shall select by random lot a

number of Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares to cause the total

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of Cash Election Shares multiplied
by the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash
Consideration, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, elect to reduce the
Aggregate Cash Consideration to an amount not less than the product of the Cash
Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration and apply the

<p><font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><br>
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
been advised that I may be considered an &quot;affiliate&quot; of GA Financial,
as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 145 (&quot;Rule 145&quot;) under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;).&nbsp; Pursuant to the Agreement, GA Financial will
be merged with and into FCFC, and I may receive shares of FCFC common stock
(the &quot;Shares&quot;) in exchange for my shares of GA Financial common
stock.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
represent and warrant to, and agree with FCFC that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have carefully read this letter agreement and the Merger Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Shares, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for GA Financial.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares in
violation of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have been advised that the issuance of the Shares to me has been registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) under the
Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4.&nbsp; I have also been advised, however, that
because I may be considered an &quot;affiliate&quot; of GA Financial at the
time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the shareholders of GA Financial,
any public offer or sale by me of any of the Shares will require either (i) the
further registration of the Shares under the Securities Act, (ii) compliance by
me with Rule 145 or (iii) the availability of another exemption from
registration of such Shares under the Securities Act.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
understand that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act
for distribution by me, and that the Shares must be held by me unless (i) such
Shares have </font></p>

<font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><br clear=all>
</font>

<p><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">been registered for distribution under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale
of the Shares is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (iii) I deliver to FCFC an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to FCFC that some other
exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available with respect
to any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
understand that FCFC is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of the Shares by me or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from registration available to me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to transfer agents of
FCFC with respect to the Shares, and the following legend will be placed on the
certificates representing such Shares:<br>
<br>
The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented
by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a
Letter Agreement dated __________, 2004, between the registered holder hereof
and First Commonwealth Financial Corporation, a copy of which agreement is on
file at the principal offices of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
understand and agree that the legend set forth in paragraph 6 above will be
removed by the delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if I
deliver to First Commonwealth (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC,
or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to First
Commonwealth, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of
the Securities Act or (ii) evidence or representations satisfactory to First
Commonwealth that the Shares represented by such certificates are being or have
been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
letter agreement will apply to all shares of GA Financial common stock and all
of the Shares that I am deemed to beneficially own pursuant to applicable
federal securities laws.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its
acceptance of this Letter Agreement, First Commonwealth agrees that for a
period of two years after the effective time of the Merger, it will file on a
timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information
provisions of SEC Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act are satisfied and the
resale provisions of SEC Rules 145(d)(1) and (2) are therefore available to me
in the event I desire to transfer any Shares issued to me in the Merger.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very
