 **1.4** ** _Conversion of Company Common Stock._** At the Effective Time: 
  
  (a) Subject to the allocation and
proration procedures set forth in Section 1.10,and except as provided in
Sections 1.5 and 1.12, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive from Purchaser, at the election of the holder
thereof pursuant to Section 1.10, either: 
  
  (i) cash in an amount
equal to $35.00 per share (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"); or 
  
  (ii) a number of shares
of Purchaser Common Stock which is equal to the Exchange Ratio. 
  
  (b) The holders of certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of Company, except such rights, if any, as they may have
pursuant to the DGCL.  Except as provided above, until certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock are surrendered for exchange,
each certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the amount and type of consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby shall have been converted
by the Merger as provided above. 
  
  (c) The stock transfer books of
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be made thereafter. 
  
  **1.5** ** _Company Treasury Stock; Shares owned by
Purchaser._** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
shares of Company Common Stock issued immediately prior to the Effective Time
which are then owned beneficially or of record (a) by Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (b) by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary, in each case,
other than shares held in an agency or fiduciary capacity or as a result of
debts previously contracted, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be canceled at
the Effective Time without payment of any consideration therefor and without
any conversion thereof. 
  
  **1.6** ** _Purchaser Common Stock._** The shares
of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, on and after the Effective Time, remain issued and
outstanding as the same number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock. 
  
  **1.7** ** _Fractional Shares._** Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
and no certificates, or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership
thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu of fractional
shares, Purchaser shall pay to each Company Stockholder who would otherwise
be entitled to a fractional share an amount of cash determined by multiplying
such fraction by the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
  
  **1.8** ** _Anti-Dilution._** In the event
Purchaser changes the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend or recapitalization with respect to the outstanding Purchaser Common
Stock and the effective date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time,
then, for purposes of computing the Average Closing Price (and, thus, the
Exchange Ratio), the closing prices of the Purchaser 


  

3

   
   

Common Stock for all trading days prior to the effective date of such stock
split, stock dividend or recapitalization shall be proportionately adjusted. 
  
  **1.9** ** _Company Options._** ** _ 
  
_** (a) At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of any holder of an
option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Option Plan
(a "Company Option"), each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised shall, at the election of the holder thereof pursuant to Section
1.9(b), be either: 
  
  (i) assumed by
Purchaser and converted into an option to purchase Purchaser Common Stock
(a "Substituted Option") on the same terms and conditions as are in effect
with respect to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that (A) each Substituted Option may be exercised solely for shares of
Purchaser Common Stock, (B) the number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock subject to each Substituted Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, the
product being rounded, if necessary, up or down to the nearest whole share,
and (C) the per share exercise price under each Substituted Option shall be
equal to the per share exercise price of the assumed Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, the
quotient being rounded, if necessary, up or down to the nearest cent; 
  
  (ii) cancelled and all
rights thereunder be extinguished ("Cancelled Option"), in consideration for
which Company shall make payment immediately after the Effective Time in an
amount determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, over (y) the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
or 
  
  (iii) assumed by
Purchaser and converted into an option to purchase Purchaser Common Stock
as provided in Section 1.9(a)(i) with respect to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option designated by the holder
thereof and cancelled in consideration for payment as provided in Section
1.9(a)(ii) with respect to the remaining shares of Company Common Stock
subject thereto. 
  
  (b) In order for any holder of a
Company Option to have his or her Company Options converted into a
Substituted Option as set forth in Section 1.9(a)(i) or to receive cash in
exchange for a Cancelled Option as set forth in Section 1.9(a)(ii) or to
receive a Substituted Option and cash as set forth in Section 1.9(a)(iii),
such holder shall have executed a written election with respect to such
conversion or cancellation no later than three business days prior to
the Effective Time, which written election shall be in such form as shall
be prescribed by Company and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. No
payment shall be made to a holder of a Cancelled Option unless and until such
holder has executed and delivered the foregoing written election. In
the event any holder of a Company Option fails to make an election within the
time frame set forth herein, the Company Option held thereby shall
automatically be converted at the Effective Time into an option to purchase
Purchaser Common Stock in the amount and at the exercise price as calculated
pursuant to Section 1.9(a)(i).

  


 4

   
   

 (c) As to any Company Option that is an incentive stock option, it is intended that the adjustments provided in Section 1.9(a)(i) shall be effected in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent that it is not consistent with such requirements, Section 424(a) shall override anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.9(a)(i). 
  
  (d) No later than two business
days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall deliver to Purchaser a
schedule which sets forth, as of that date, a complete and accurate list of
outstanding Company Options, indicating (i) the holder thereof, (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, (iii) the exercise
price therefor, and (iv) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option with respect to which the holder has elected to
receive a Substituted Option and/or cash as provided in Section 1.9(a).
Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall reserve for issuance the number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock necessary to satisfy Purchaser\'s
obligations under Section 1.9(a). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 20 business days thereafter,
Purchaser shall (i) file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC
registering the shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Substituted
Options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as
such options remain outstanding, and (ii) take such other actions as are
required under applicable state securities laws for so long as such options
remain outstanding. 
  
  **1.10** ** _Election and Exchange Procedures._** 

  (a) Purchaser shall designate The
Bank of New York (or another bank selected by Purchaser and reasonably
acceptable to Company) as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of
conducting the election procedure and the exchange procedure as described in
this Section 1.10. Company shall promptly provide or cause to be provided to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the Exchange
Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein. 
  
  (b) Company shall include with
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus sent to the Company Stockholders an election
form for use by the Company Stockholders in making the election described
below as to the form of consideration to be received for their Company Common
Stock (the "Election Form") and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials for use by the Company Stockholders in transmitting the
certificates representing Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss of Company
Common Stock certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent (the "Letter of Transmittal). The
Election Form and the Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and
substance as designated by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to Company.
Purchaser shall thereafter make available one or more copies of the Election
Form and the Letter of Transmittal as may be reasonably requested by Persons
who become Company Stockholders after the record date for the Special Meeting
and prior to the Election Deadline. The Election Form shall permit each
Company Stockholder (or beneficial owner through appropriate and customary
documentation and instructions) to elect to receive either (i) Purchaser
Common Stock with respect to all of such holder\'s shares of Company Common
Stock, (ii) cash with respect to all of such holder\'s shares of Company

  


 5

   
   

Common Stock, or (iii) Purchaser Common Stock in exchange for a specified
number of shares of Company Common Stock and cash in exchange for a specified
number of shares of Company Common Stock. Shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which a Company Stockholder elects to receive Purchaser Common
Stock are referred to as "Stock Election Shares."  Shares of Company Common
Stock with respect to which a Company Stockholder elects to receive cash are
referred to as "Cash Election Shares." Any shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares, which are dealt with in Section 1.12 and
shares which are cancelled without payment pursuant to Section 1.5) with
respect to which the holder fails to make an effective election to
receive Purchaser Common Stock or cash, together with shares of Company
Common Stock with respect to which a Company Stockholder exercises his or her
rights to appraisal under the DGCL and, as of the Election Deadline, has
failed to perfect or effectively withdrawn or lost such rights, are referred
to as "No-Election Shares." Nominee record holders who hold Company Common
Stock on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the
shares held by them are Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares and No-
Election Shares. 
  
  (c) Any election by a Company
Stockholder to receive Purchaser Common Stock or cash shall be effective only
if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a signed and properly
completed Election Form by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the last business day
before the date of the Special Meeting (the "Election Deadline"); provided,
that if all Regulatory Approvals have not been obtained prior to such date,
Purchaser shall extend the Election deadline until the third business day
following the receipt of the final Regulatory Approval. If the Election
Deadline is so extended, Purchaser shall promptly issue a press release
advising the Company Stockholders of the extension and, upon receipt of the
final Regulatory Approval, shall issue a press release advising the Company
Stockholders of the revised Election Deadline. An Election Form will be
properly completed only if all information called for by the Election Form is
provided and, (i) in the case of shares that represented by certificates,
only if accompanied by a certificate or certificates representing all shares
of Company Common Stock covered thereby, and (ii) in the case of shares that
are held in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares"), only upon compliance with
the book-entry delivery procedures reasonably established by Purchaser and
the Exchange Agent, in each case, subject to the provisions of subsection (g)
of this Section 1.10.  Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the
Person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice
to the Exchange Agent only if such notice is actually received by the
Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. All elections shall be
revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by
Purchaser and Company that this Agreement has been terminated and, in that
event, the Exchange Agent shall promptly return all Company Common Stock
certificates and Book-Entry Shares received by it to the appropriate Company
Stockholders. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received and
whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made. 
  
  (d) Within five (5) business days
after the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation
among Company Stockholders of rights to receive Purchaser Common Stock or
cash in the Merger as follows: 
  
  (i) If the number of
Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration is less
than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:

  


 6

   
   

 (A) No-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the extent necessary to cause the total number of Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration to equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less than all of the No-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash Election Shares in order to accomplish that result, then the Exchange Agent shall select by random lot a sufficient number of No-Election Shares to be converted into Cash Election Shares to cause the total number of Cash Election Shares after such conversion multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration to equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all remaining No-Election Shares shall be treated as Stock Election Shares. 
  
  (B) If all of
the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash Election Shares under
the preceding subsection and the total number of Cash Election Shares
multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration is still less than the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro
rata basis (subject to rounding to avoid the conversion of fractional shares)
a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares to
cause the total number of Cash Election Shares after such conversion times
the Per Share Cash Consideration to equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. 
  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of Cash Election Shares
multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, elect to reduce
the Aggregate Cash Consideration to an amount not less than the product of
the Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration and
apply the foregoing allocation procedure (if necessary) using the Aggregate
Cash Consideration as so reduced. 
  
  (ii) If the number of
Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration is
greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then: 
  
  (A) All No-
Election Shares shall be deemed to be Stock Election Shares. 
  
  (B)
The Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis (subject to rounding to
avoid the conversion of fractional shares) a sufficient number of Cash
Election Shares into Stock Election Shares to cause the number of remaining
Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration to equal
the Aggregate Cash Consideration. 
  
  (e) Following and giving effect
to any reallocation (if necessary) under subsection (d) of this Section 1.10,
all Stock Election Shares and all No-Election Shares will be converted into
the right to receive Purchaser Common Stock as provided in Section 1.4(a)(ii)
and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted, effective as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive cash as provided in
Section 1.4(a)(i). 
  
  (f) At or prior to the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall authorize the Exchange Agent to issue the number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in the Merger and shall deliver to
the Exchange Agent the amount of cash payable in the Merger. All

  


 7

   
   

such shares shall be deemed to have been issued as of the Effective Time.
The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to such shares. 
  
  (g) After the Effective Time,
each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which prior thereto
represented shares of Company Common Stock who has surrendered or surrenders
such certificate or certificates to the Exchange Agent with a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, and each Company Stockholder holding Book-
Entry Shares who has complied with the book-entry delivery procedures
established by Purchaser and the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance of such
certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to a
certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of
Purchaser Common Stock and/or the amount of cash into which the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock surrendered or delivered shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement and, if such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted into Purchaser Common Stock, cash in
lieu of fractional shares, and any distribution previously paid with respect
to Purchaser Common Stock issuable in the Merger for which the record
date was on or after the Effective Date, in each case without interest. Each
Company Stockholder who receives shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the
Merger shall receive a prospectus and enrollment materials for Purchaser\'s
dividend reinvestment plan together with such Stockholder\'s Purchaser Common
Stock certificate or certificates. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each
outstanding certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein
provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent be deemed to evidence
ownership of the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock and/or the right
to receive the amount of cash into which such Company Common Stock shall have
been converted. No dividends which have been declared will be remitted to
any Person entitled to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock under this
Section 1.10 until such Person surrenders the certificate or certificates
representing Company Common Stock, at which time such dividends shall be
remitted to such Person without interest. 
  
  (h) The Exchange Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to distribute Purchaser Common Stock and cash
as provided herein not later than ten (10) business days after the Effective
Time to the former Company Stockholders who submitted a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal and Company stock certificates prior to the Election
Deadline.  The Exchange Agent shall distribute Purchaser Common Stock and
cash as provided herein to other former Company Stockholders within a
reasonable time after its receipt of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and Company Common Stock certificates from such former Company
Stockholder. 
  
  (i) If any certificate for
Company Common Stock has been lost or destroyed, the Company Stockholder in
whose name that certificate is registered may submit to the Exchange Agent,
in lieu of such certificate, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity
agreement and/or a bond in such sum as may be required by the Exchange Agent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed. If any certificates evidencing shares of

  


 8

   
   

Purchaser Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the certificate,
with all signatures guaranteed, and otherwise in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. 
  
  (j) Any portion of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.10(f) that remains unclaimed by the Company
Stockholders for one year (or such later period as Purchaser and the Exchange
Agent may agree) after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any
distributions on such shares and any investment of any cash held by the
Exchange Agent) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser.
Any Company Stockholder who has not complied with Section 1.10(g) before
the expiration of such period shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for
the consideration deliverable to such stockholder in the Merger as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Neither
the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for any consideration paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.  Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of those
Persons entitled to receive consideration specified in this Agreement, which
books shall be conclusive with respect to the identify of such Persons. In
the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit
any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. 
  
  **1.11** ** _Withholding Rights._** Purchaser
(through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Company Stockholder such amounts as Purchaser is required under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. ** 
  
** **1.12** ** _Dissenting Shares._** Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Purchaser Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
are held by Company Stockholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger and
who have complied with all of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Dissenting Shares" and "Dissenting Stockholders," respectively), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the consideration provided in
Section 1.4, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the
DGCL. Company shall give Purchaser (a) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by Company relating to Company

  


 9

   
   

Stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to direct, in its
reasonable business judgment, all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent at any time following the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be converted into the right to receive
the merger consideration provided in Section 1.4 as if such Dissenting Shares
were Stock Election Shares. ** 
  
** **1.13** ** _Closing._** Subject to the provisions
of Article 6 hereof, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to Closing, and shall be on
such date, time and location as Purchaser and Company shall mutually agree.
If all conditions to the obligations of each of the parties shall have been
satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof, the
parties shall, at the Closing, duly execute the Articles of Merger for filing
with the Pennsylvania Secretary of State and the Certificate of Merger for
filing with the Delaware Secretary of State and promptly thereafter shall
take all steps necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger in accordance
with all applicable Laws. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date." The Bank Merger will be consummated
after the Merger at a time selected by Purchaser and pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Bank Plan of Merger.

of filing contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is required to file any form, report
or other document with the SEC. Except for normal periodic examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the regular course of the business of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, since December 31, 2000, no Regulatory
Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of Company,
investigation into the business or operations of Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries. Company and each Company Subsidiary has resolved all
material violations, criticisms or exceptions by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any such normal periodic examination. Neither Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice from, or is a party to
any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to
any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order
or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter
from, any Governmental Entity or any staff thereof (i) asserting that Company
or any Company Subsidiary is not in substantial compliance with any
statute, regulation or ordinance which such Governmental Entity enforces, or
with the internal policies and procedures of such entity, or (ii) directing,
restricting or limiting in any manner the operations of Company or any
Company Subsidiary, including with respect to such entities\' capital
adequacy, its credit policies, its management, or the payment of dividends. 
  
  (c) The books and records of
Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are being, maintained in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions and reasonable accruals. 
  
  (d) Since December 31, 2002,
there have been no significant changes in the internal controls utilized by
Company and Company Subsidiaries with respect to their financial records (the
"Internal Controls") or in other factors that could significantly affect the
Internal Controls, including any corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. There are no significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of the Internal Controls which could
adversely affect the ability of Company and Company Subsidiaries to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and there are no material
weaknesses in the Internal Controls. Company is not aware of any fraud or
suspected fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in preparing Company\'s
consolidated financial statements.

have paid all rents and other charges to the extent due under the Leases.

has not granted to any Person any license, option or other rights to use in
any manner any of the Intellectual Property Rights, whether requiring the
payment of royalties or not. The Intellectual Property Rights will not cease
to be rights of Company or be impaired by reason of the performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. No
other Person (i) has notified Company that such Person claims any ownership
of or right to use any Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) to the Knowledge
of Company, is infringing upon any Intellectual Property Rights.  To the

required to be stated herein or therein or necessary to make the statements
made herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

  **ARTICLE 5 
  
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS**

  


  **5.1** ** _Regulatory Approvals._** ** _ 
  

  
_** (a) As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser will prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings with the appropriate Governmental Entities (collectively, the
"Regulatory Applications") and to obtain the Regulatory Approvals at the
earliest practicable date and shall take such other action as may be
necessary to obtain the Regulatory Approvals at the earliest practicable
date; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.1 shall be construed
to obligate Purchaser to take any action to meet any condition required to
obtain prior Regulatory Approval if any such condition materially
differs from conditions customarily imposed by such Governmental Entities in
orders approving acquisitions of the type contemplated by this Agreement,
constitutes a significant impediment upon Purchaser\'s ability to carry on
its business or acquisition programs (as determined by Purchaser in its
reasonable discretion) or requires Purchaser to increase FCB\'s capital
ratios to amounts in excess of the FDIC\'s minimum capital ratio guidelines
which may be in effect from time to time. Purchaser shall pay all fees
and expenses relating to the preparation and filing the Regulatory
Applications and obtaining the Regulatory Approvals. 
  
  (b) Company shall cooperate with
Purchaser to effect the foregoing and will promptly furnish Purchaser with
all information about or pertaining to Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as is reasonably determined by Purchaser to be necessary or appropriate for
such filings.  Company and Purchaser shall have the right to review in
advance, and will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide
either party with a right to review any information provided to any
Governmental Entity on a confidential basis in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Company shall be provided with a draft of
the Regulatory Applications and all correspondence with
Regulatory Authorities relating to the Regulatory Applications and
Regulatory Approvals. Company shall have a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such applications and correspondence. In exercising
the foregoing rights and obligations, each of the parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 
  
  (c) Purchaser and Company shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Regulatory
Approvals and all other permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Entities and third parties necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties will
keep the other party

  


 34

   
   

apprised of the status of the Regulatory Approvals and such other permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations. 
  
  **5.2** ** _Registration Statement._** As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Purchaser, in
cooperation with Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger (the "Registration Statement").  The Registration
Statement shall contain a proxy statement/prospectus (the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus") which shall serve as the proxy statement of Company
for the Special Meeting and as the prospectus of Purchaser for the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Company shall furnish
Purchaser with all information about or pertaining to Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as is reasonably determined by Purchaser to be necessary or
appropriate for the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, including, without limitation, any information
necessary to comply with provisions of the DGCL relating to dissenters\'
rights. The parties shall cooperate in responding to and considering any
questions or comments from the SEC staff regarding the information contained
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. Purchaser will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
be declared effective at the earliest practicable date, and Purchaser will
advise Company, promptly after Purchaser receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of the Purchaser Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any
such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of
the Registration Statement or for additional information. 
  
  **5.3** ** _Special Meeting._** Company shall call
a special meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "Special Meeting") to be
held as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC for purposes of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby.  Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain the votes of
the Company Stockholders in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and, unless and until a
Subsequent Determination shall have been made after complying with the
provisions of Section 5.4, the Board of Directors of Company shall recommend
approval of such transactions by such holders. In connection with the Special
Meeting, Purchaser and Company shall cooperate in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, with the approval of each of Purchaser and
Company (which approvals will not be unreasonably withheld), the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be mailed to the Company Stockholders. 
  
  **5.4** ** _Acquisition Proposals._** From the
date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Closing, Company shall not, nor shall Company authorize or permit any
officers, directors, employees, representatives or other agents of Company or
any Company Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to
solicit, initiate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) engage in
negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to Company
or any Company Subsidiary or afford access to the properties, books or
records of Company or any Company Subsidiary to, any Person that may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this

  


 35

   
   

Agreement shall prevent Company or the Board of Directors of Company at any
time prior to the consummation of the Merger from: 
  
  (a) furnishing nonpublic
information to, or affording access to the properties, books or records of
Company or any Company Subsidiary to, or entering into negotiations with, any
Person in connection with an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by such Person,
if (a) Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith that
such action is necessary to comply with their fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law; (b) prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person, Company\'s Board of Directors receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement with customary terms, and (c) Company\'s
Board of Directors concludes in the exercise of its fiduciary duties that
the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; 
  
  (b) taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders any position, and making any related filings with the
SEC, as required by Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, with
respect to any Alternative Transaction that is a tender offer; provided, that
Company\'s Board of Directors shall not recommend that the Company
Stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
any such tender offer unless the Board shall have determined in good
faith that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; or 
  
  (c) if an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal is received as described in clause (i) above, informing the Company
Stockholders that it no longer believes that the Merger is advisable and no
longer recommends approval of the Merger (a "Subsequent Determination"),
approving or recommending an Alternative Transaction based on that
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal or entering into an Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such an Alternative Transaction if (i) Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith that such action is necessary to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (b) Company\'s Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal. 
  
 Company will promptly notify Purchaser after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to
Company or any Company Subsidiary or for access to the properties, books or
records of Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal and will keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.
Such written notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and
state that the Board of Directors of Company intends to make, or is
considering making, a Subsequent Determination. For a period of three
business days following such notice, Company shall not take any action with
respect to the Acquisition Proposal and shall provide an opportunity for
Purchaser to propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Board of Directors of Company to proceed with
the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

  


 36

   
   

 **5.5** ** _Employees and Employee Benefits._** ** _ 
  
_** (a) Upon consummation of the
Merger and the Bank Merger, all employees of Company and Great American shall
be deemed to be at-will employees of Purchaser and FCB, respectively, subject
only to, and to the extent provided in, those written employment agreements
which have been disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule. At the
discretion of Purchaser, subject to the requirements of the Code and except
as expressly set forth in this Section 5.5, from and after the Effective
Time, all Company Benefit Plans shall continue to be maintained separately,
or be consolidated, frozen or terminated. Employees of Company and Great
American who continue as employees of Purchaser and FCB ("Continuing
Employees") shall be entitled to participate, commencing at the Effective
Time, on an equitable basis in the same benefit plans, programs or policies
as are generally available to employees of Purchaser or FCB, as the case may
be, of similar rank and status. For purposes of eligibility, vesting,
accrual of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any qualified
defined benefit plan maintained by Purchaser) and determination of the level
of benefits under any employee benefit plans, arrangements or policies
(including, without limitation, severance, vacation, sick and other leave
policies) maintained by Purchaser, Continuing Employees will be credited with
prior years of service with Company or Great American. Purchaser and FCB
shall give service credit to Continuing Employees (and their dependents) with
respect to the satisfaction of the limitations as to pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods for
participation and coverage that are applicable under the employee welfare
benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) of Purchaser or
FCB, equal to the credit that any such employee had received as of the
Effective Time towards the satisfaction of any such limitations and waiting
periods under the comparable employee welfare benefit plans of Company or
Company Subsidiaries and shall waive preexisting condition limitations to the
same extent waived under the corresponding plans of Company or Company
Subsidiaries. Nothing contained herein shall obligate Purchaser to provide
severance or other benefits that are based on years of service with
duplicative benefits for the same years of service. 
  
  (b) No Continuing Employee shall
be subject to any waiting period under any welfare benefit plan of Purchaser
to the extent that such period is longer than the period, if any, to which
such Continuing Employee was subject under the applicable welfare benefit
plan of Company.  Continuing Employees shall not be subject to any waiting
period under a welfare benefit plan of Purchaser if the applicable waiting
period under the corresponding Company plan had been satisfied as of the
Effective Time. To the extent that the initial period of coverage for
Continuing Employees under any plan of Purchaser that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full twelve (12)
month period of coverage, Continuing Employees shall be given full credit
under the applicable welfare plan for any deductibles and co-insurance
payments made by such Continuing Employees under the corresponding welfare
plan of Company during the balance of such twelve (12) month period
of coverage. Nothing contained herein shall obligate Purchaser to provide
or cause to be provided any duplicative benefits. 
  
  (c) The Company Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ("ESOP") shall be terminated as of the Effective Time. The
Board of Directors of Company shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the trustees of the ESOP, to the extent consistent with the fiduciary

  


 37

   
   

duties of the trustees under ERISA, to make such elections under Article 1 of
this Agreement with respect to unallocated shares of Company Common Stock
held by the ESOP as are necessary to obtain a sufficient amount of cash to
repay in full the then outstanding ESOP indebtedness. The Merger
consideration received by the ESOP trustees with respect to the unallocated
shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP shall be first applied by the
ESOP trustees to the full repayment of the ESOP loan. The remaining shares
of Purchaser Common Stock and cash received by the ESOP shall be allocated to
the ESOP participants in accordance with the terms of the ESOP and applicable
Laws as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. In connection with the
termination of the ESOP, Company shall promptly apply to the IRS for a
favorable determination letter on the tax-qualified status of the ESOP on
terminations and any amendments made to the ESOP in connection with its
termination or otherwise, if such amendments have not previously received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to their
qualification under Code Section 401(a). Any amendments to the ESOP requested
by the IRS prior to the Effective Time shall be adopted by Company and any
amendments requested by the IRS after the Effective Time shall be promptly
adopted by Purchaser. Any and all distributions from the ESOP after its
termination shall be made consistent with the aforementioned
determination letter from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time, Company
shall make contributions to, and payments on the loan of the ESOP consistent
with past practices on regularly scheduled payment dates. 
  
  (d) The Great American Federal
401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") will be merged with and into the
Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan within an administratively reasonable time after the
Effective Date.  Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate the
Purchaser\'s 401(k) plan pursuant to the terms of that plan within an
administratively reasonable period of time after the Effective Date, as
provided in Section 5.5(a) above. No contributions will be made to the
Company 401(k) Plan after the Effective Date. 
  
  (e) From the Effective Time,
Purchaser agrees to honor the terms of the severance, employment, change of
control and deferred compensation agreements set forth in Sections 3.16(a)
and 3.17(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Post-
Termination Payments").  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "Change in Control" for
purposes of such agreements. 
  
  (f) From and after the Effective
Time, Purchaser agrees to maintain in full force and effect the bank-owned
life insurance program for Company directors (the "Company Director BOLI")
and the bank-owned life insurance program for Company officers (the "Company
Officer BOLI"). Purchaser agrees that the Merger will constitute a "Change
in Control" for purposes of the Company Director BOLI. Purchaser agrees to
continue the Company Officer BOLI in accordance with its terms for the
remainder of the life of each executive officer that is participating in the
Company Officer BOLI at the Effective Time; provided, that if it is
determined that the Company Officer BOLI is not permitted by Law with respect
to any participant then Purchaser may terminate the Company Officer BOLI with
respect to such participant and Purchaser shall provide such participant with
a substantially equivalent life insurance benefit. 
  
  (g) As of the Effective Time,
Company\'s Board of Directors shall take action to immediately vest all
Awards under the 1996 Stock-Based Incentive Plan ("Option

  


 38

   
   

Plan"), terminate the Option Plan and its related trust, and make all final
distributions in accordance with the terms of the Option Plan. Any remaining
Company Common Stock in the Option Plan shall be returned to Company. 
  
  (h) Prior to the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of Great American shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to cause the Great American Employee Severance
Compensation Plan to terminate effective as of a date that is one year and
one day after the Effective Time.  Subject to the preceding sentence,
Purchaser agrees to assume the obligations of Great American under the and to
honor the terms of such plan. 
  
  (i) Except as expressly provided
in this Section 5.5, Purchaser may amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan at any time in accordance with its terms. 
  
  **5.6** ** _Indemnification of Company Directors,
Officers and Other Persons._** ** _ 
  
_** (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer, employee or agent of Company or any Company Subsidiary (the
"Covered Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys\' fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Covered Party is or was an officer,
director, employee or agent of Company or any Company Subsidiary or was
serving as an officer, director or trustee of another Person at the request
of Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. Each Covered Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
Purchaser within ten business days of receipt by Purchaser from the Covered
Party of a request therefore, provided, that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL,
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is
not entitled to indemnification. 
  
  (b) Subject to the next sentence,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for three years from the Effective Time, the current policies of the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by Company with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the
aggregate premium therefore would not be in excess of 300% of the higher of
(i) the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii)
the last annual premium paid prior to the Closing Date (the "Maximum
Premium"). If the Company\'s existing insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such three year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for
an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Covered Parties than the Company\'s
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance.

  


 39

   
   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Covered Party, on or prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 
  
  (d) The covenants contained in
this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Covered Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which a Covered Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. 
  
  (e) In the event that Purchaser
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in

disbands the Advisory Board, fails to require or request the attendance of a
member with respect to at least four meetings of the Advisory Board
and/or committee thereof during the term specified above, or removes a member
of the Advisory Board other than because such member acted in a manner
detrimental to FCB, in each case prior to the end of the 12-month period

failure shall nonetheless be paid the full amount of unpaid fees that would

order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will
not take any action or fail to take any action that would result in the
Merger not qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code. 
  
  **5.18** ** _Confidentiality._** Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, any party to this Agreement (as well as their representatives) may
disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) related to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, that
this sentence shall not permit any person making such disclosure to disclose
the name of, or other information that would identify, any party to
such transaction or to disclose confidential commercial or strategic
information, or other proprietary information regarding such transaction not
related to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided further, that the
disclosure authorization granted under this sentence shall not be effective
with respect to any person until the earliest of (i) the date of a public
announcement (if any) of discussions relating to such transaction involving
such person, (ii) the date of a public announcement (if any) of any such
transaction involving such person or (iii) the date of the execution of a
definitive agreement (if any) to enter into any such transaction involving
such person, it being understood that there are no limits at any time on the
ability of any party to consult its own independent tax advisor regarding the
tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction.

of the parties; 
  
  (b) By Purchaser or Company: 
  
  (i) In the event the
Closing shall not have occurred by September 30, 2004, unless the failure of
the Closing to occur shall be due to the breach of this Agreement by the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that,
if Purchaser and FCB shall have filed all Regulatory Applications within
sixty (60) days of the date hereof, and if the Closing shall not have

Regulatory Approval necessary for the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger (or should such Regulatory Approval be conditioned upon a substantial
deviation from the transactions contemplated), unless the denial of such

Agreement; provided, however, that either Purchaser or Company may,

within 30 days after the notice of breach.

Directors determines in good faith to terminate this Agreement,

provisions of Section 7.3, shall terminate without further liability of any

intentional breach of this Agreement, or be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any available remedy for any such willful or intentional breach. 
  
  **7.3** ** _Termination Fee._** ** _ 
  
_** (a) _Upon Termination._ If
(i) Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of

Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger  Agreement") dated as of December
11, 2003 among First Commonwealth  Financial Corporation ("FCFC"), First
Commonwealth Bank, GA  Financial, Inc. ("GA Financial"), and Great American
Financial  Savings and Loan Association

    
---|--- 
   


 Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  
  I have been advised that I may be considered an "affiliate" of
GA Financial, as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 145 ("Rule 145")
under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). Pursuant to the
Agreement, GA Financial will be merged with and into FCFC, and I may receive
shares of FCFC common stock (the "Shares") in exchange for my shares of GA
Financial common stock. 
  
  I represent and warrant to, and agree with FCFC that: 
  
  1. I have carefully read this letter
agreement and the Merger Agreement and have discussed their requirements and
other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Shares, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or
counsel for GA Financial. 
  
  2. I will not make any sale, transfer or
other disposition of the Shares in violation of the Securities Act or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
  
  3. I have been advised that the issuance
of the Shares to me has been registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement
on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that because I may be
considered an "affiliate" of GA Financial at the time the Merger was
submitted for a vote of the shareholders of GA Financial, any public offer or
sale by me of any of the Shares will require either (i) the further
registration of the Shares under the Securities Act, (ii) compliance by me
with Rule 145 or (iii) the availability of another exemption
from registration of such Shares under the Securities Act. 
  4. I understand that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act for distribution by me, and that the
Shares must be held by me unless (i) such Shares have

   
   

been registered for distribution under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale of the
Shares is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 under the Securities Act or (iii) I deliver to FCFC an opinion of counsel
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to FCFC that some
other exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available with
respect to any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares. 
  
  5. I understand that FCFC is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares
by me or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with
an exemption from registration available to me. 
  
  6. I understand that stop transfer
instructions will be given to transfer agents of FCFC with respect to the
Shares, and the following legend will be placed on the certificates
representing such Shares: 
  
 The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction
to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with
the terms of a Letter Agreement dated __________, 2004, between the
registered holder hereof and First Commonwealth Financial Corporation, a copy
of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of First Commonwealth
Financial Corporation. 
  
  7. I understand and agree that the legend
set forth in paragraph 6 above will be removed by the delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend if I deliver to First Commonwealth (i) a
copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to First Commonwealth, to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii)
evidence or representations satisfactory to First Commonwealth that the
Shares represented by such certificates are being or have been sold in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d). 
  
  8. This letter agreement will apply to all
shares of GA Financial common stock and all of the Shares that I am deemed to
beneficially own pursuant to applicable federal securities laws. 
  
  By its acceptance of this Letter Agreement, First Commonwealth
agrees that for a period of two years after the effective time of the Merger,
it will file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it
pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so
that the public information provisions of SEC Rule 144(c) under the
Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of SEC Rules 145(d)(1)
and (2) are therefore available to me in the event I desire to transfer any
Shares issued to me in the Merger. 
  
 
Very truly yours,

 _ 
 VOTING AGREEMENT_

  


  This VOTING AGREEMENT is made as of December ___, 2003
by the undersigned shareholder (the "Shareholder") of GA Financial, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("GA Financial"), for the benefit of First
Commonwealth Financial Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the
"Purchaser"). 


  

 _Recitals_ 


  

 Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement") among Purchaser, First Commonwealth Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered banking corporation, GA Financial, and Great American Federal, a federally-chartered savings and loan association, the Purchaser has agreed to acquire GA Financial in a merger in which the outstanding shares of Common Stock of GA Financial will be converted, at the election of the holder (subject to proration as provided in the Merger Agreement), into the right to receive $35.00 per share in cash or shares of Purchaser\'s Common Stock (the "Merger"). As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser has required that the Shareholder agree, and the Shareholder is willing to agree, to the matters set forth herein. 


  

 _Agreement_

  


  Accordingly, in consideration of the agreements of the
Purchaser in the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Shareholder, intending to be legally bound hereby, agrees as follows for
the benefit of the Purchaser: 
  
  1. _Representations and Warranties of
Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and warrants to the Purchaser that
he is the beneficial owner of and has the power to vote or direct the voting
of the number of shares of GA Financial Common Stock set forth opposite his
signature below (together with any other shares of GA Financial Common Stock
acquired by the Shareholder prior to the termination of this Agreement, the
"Shares"). 
  
  2. _Transfer and Other Restrictions_.
The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Merger, he shall not: 
  
  (a) sell, exchange, transfer,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract,
option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale,
exchange, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of,
any of the Shares (other than Shares sold in connection with the cashless
exercise of an option, provided that the Shareholder agrees to notify the
Purchaser promptly after any such exercise), unless any subsequent holder
agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof; 
  
  (b) grant any proxies or enter
into any voting agreement or similar arrangement with respect to any of the
Shares, except proxies instructing that the Shares be voted in accordance
with Section 3; or 
  
  (c) deposit any of the Shares into
a voting trust or other similar arrangement, unless the trustee is required
by the terms thereof to vote the Shares in accordance with Section 3. 
  


   
   

 3. _Voting_. The Shareholder agrees to attend, in person or by proxy, all meetings of the shareholders of GA Financial and, at any meeting of the shareholders of GA Financial, agrees to vote all of the Shares: 
  
  (a) in favor of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 
  
  (b) against any action or
agreement that could result in a breach in any material respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty of GA Financial in the Merger Agreement;
and 
  
  (c) except as otherwise agreed by
the Purchaser or permitted under the Merger Agreement, against (i) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, rights offering,
reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation involving GA Financial, other
than the Merger, or (ii) a sale or transfer of a material portion of the
assets of GA Financial or the issuance of any securities of GA Financial,
other than upon exercise of outstanding options. 
  
  4. _Specific Enforcement_. The
Shareholder acknowledges that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a
breach of this Agreement and that the obligations of the Shareholder shall be
specifically enforceable, in addition to any other remedy which may be
available to the Purchaser at law or in equity. 
  
  5. _Termination_. This Agreement shall
terminate without any action by any of the parties hereto upon the earlier to
occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms or
(ii) the effective date of the Merger. 
  
  6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. 
  
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Shareholder as of the date first written above.
