(a) _Closing Date_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson

(v) Seller and Buyer shall deliver, each to the other, such documents as are

Section 2.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth, as of the Effective Time, the
Net Working Capital and any Business Indebtedness (the " _Closing Statement_
"), which statement shall be derived from balance sheets of the Nordisk
Business and the Telair Business as of the Effective Time, prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for the use of accounting practices, principles
and methodologies reflected in Section 2.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.
Buyer agrees that following the Closing and prior to the determination of the
Final Closing Statement, it shall neither alter nor destroy any of the Books
and Records on which the Closing Statement is to be based, and shall make such
Books and Records available to Seller and its representatives.

 



 

(b) Seller shall, within sixty (60) days after the delivery by Buyer of the
Closing Statement (" _Seller s Review Period_"), complete its review of the
Net Working Capital and any Business Indebtedness reflected on the Closing
Statement. The Closing Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and
deemed accepted by, Seller unless Seller shall have notified

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer in writing prior to the expiration of Sellers Review Period of any good
faith objection thereto (the " _Seller s Objection_"). The Sellers Objection
shall set forth a specific description of the basis of Sellers Objection and
the specific adjustments to the Net Working Capital and/or Business
Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Statement which Seller believes should
be made. Any items not disputed in a valid Sellers Objection shall be deemed
to have been accepted by Seller and shall be final and binding.

 



 

(c) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disputes with
respect to the Closing Statement within fifteen (15) days following Buyers
receipt of Sellers Objection to such Closing Statement pursuant to Section
2.6(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to the CPA Firm for
decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the parties upon
delivery of the written opinion set forth in sub-clause (iii) below. The
procedure and schedule under which any dispute shall be submitted to the CPA
Firm shall be as follows:

 



 

(i) Within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the period referred
to in paragraph (c) above, Seller shall submit any unresolved portion of
Sellers Objection to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to Buyer),
supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies.

 



 

(ii) Within fifteen (15) days following Sellers submission of the unresolved
portion of Sellers Objection as specified in sub-clause (i) above, Buyer
shall submit its response to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to Seller),
supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies.

 



 

(iii) Buyer and Seller shall request that the CPA Firm deliver its written
opinion within twenty (20) days following its receipt of the information
provided for in sub-clause (ii) above, or such longer period of time as the
CPA Firm determines is necessary, but not to exceed thirty (30) days. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to the
unresolved portion of the Sellers Objection. In resolving any disputed items,
the CPA Firm may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller. Buyer and Seller
shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant Books and Records
and any work papers (including those of the parties respective accountants)
relating to the Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by
the CPA Firm.

 



 

Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer and Seller so that Sellers share of such expenses shall be in
the same proportion that (x) the aggregate amount of the disputed items
submitted by Seller to the CPA Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed bears to
(y) the total amount of all disputed items submitted by Seller to the CPA
Firm. Seller and Buyer shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors
incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Closing
Statement.

 



 

(d) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the parties upon
the earliest of (i) if no Sellers Objection has been given, the expiration of
the period within which Seller must make the Sellers Objection pursuant to
Section 2.6(b), (ii) agreement in

 



       
 

 



 

writing by Seller and Buyer that the Closing Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Seller and Buyer, shall be final and binding
and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination
with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing Statement. The Closing
Statement, as submitted by Buyer if no timely Sellers Objection has been
given or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or as
determined pursuant to the decision of the CPA Firm, is herein referred to as
the "Final Closing Statement."

 



 

(e) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement, the adjustment payment payable pursuant to this Section
2.6(e) (the " _Adjustment Payment_ ") and interest thereon shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. The Adjustment Payment shall be equal to
the absolute value of the Post-Closing Difference. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Post-Closing Difference" shall mean (x) the Post-Closing
Working Capital Difference minus (y) any Business Indebtedness reflected on
the Final Closing Statement. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Post-Closing
Working Capital Difference" shall mean (x) the Net Working Capital, as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement, minus (y) the Working Capital
Target. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Working Capital Difference as calculated pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is $2,000,000 or less, then the Post-Closing Working
Capital Difference shall be deemed to be $0 for purposes of calculating the
Post-Closing Difference. The Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Buyer to
Seller if the Post-Closing Difference is positive, and by Seller to Buyer if
the Post-Closing Difference is negative. The Adjustment Payment shall bear
interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Closing Date
Interest Rate, which interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day
year and the actual number of days elapsed and such interest shall be paid on
the same date and in the same manner as such Adjustment Payment. Any
adjustment or non-adjustment to the Purchase Price shall not form the basis
for any claim for damages pursuant to this Agreement. The parties payment
obligations under this Section 2.6 will not be subject to offset or reduction
by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and any
right or alleged right of indemnification hereunder or for any other reason or
under any other agreement.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Taxes and Fees_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, all sales taxes, transfer taxes, stamp taxes, conveyance
taxes, mortgage taxes, intangible taxes, documentary recording taxes, license
and registration fees, notarial fees incurred in connection with the execution
of any deed of transfer, and recording fees, if any, imposed by any
Governmental Authority upon the transfer of the Shares or the Air Cargo Assets
hereunder and the filing of any instruments (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall
be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangement
designed to minimize any applicable Transfer Taxes.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries and among the Shares and
the Air Cargo Assets and the Seller covenant not to compete described in
Section 5.11 as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the
" _Allocation_ "). Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and Buyer agree to report,
pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder or any other similar provision under Law, as and when required, the
Allocation of the Purchase

 



      
 

 



 

Price, as adjusted, among the Shares, Air Cargo Assets and Seller covenant not
to compete described in Section 5.11 in a manner entirely consistent with such
Allocation in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including IRS
Form 8594). Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position (whether in
audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation
unless required to do so by Law or a determination of a taxing authority that
is final.

 



 

 _ARTICLE III_ 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter, which shall be arranged
in accordance with Section 9.7, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization and Authority_. Seller, each of the Acquired
Companies, the Satair JV and each of the Selling Subsidiaries has been duly
incorporated or formed, is validly existing and is in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (to the extent such
concept is legally recognized under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation), with the requisite power (corporate or otherwise)
and authority to own, operate or lease the properties that it purports to own,
operate or lease and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Seller
and each of the Selling Subsidiaries has the full power (corporate or
otherwise) and authority to enter into this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, as the case may be, and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Seller and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Principles_ "), and no other
proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. At Closing, the
Ancillary Agreements will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by Seller
or one or more Selling Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, will constitute legal, valid
and binding agreements of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, as applicable,
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Principles.

 



 

Section 3.2 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Seller or a Selling Subsidiary
is or will be a party, nor compliance by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and each such Ancillary
Agreement will (a) violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws or other similar organizational document of Seller, any Acquired
Company, the Satair JV or any Selling Subsidiary; (b) assuming all of the
consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or notifications to or of
Governmental Authorities contemplated by Section 3.10 are made or obtained,
violate any Law or any injunction, order or decree of any Governmental
Authority to which Seller, an Acquired Company, the Satair JV or a Selling
Subsidiary is subject; or (c) result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would
become a default) under, or give to others

 



      
 

 



 

any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance
or any Encumbrances created by actions of Buyer or its Affiliates) on, any of
the material Business Assets (including Significant Contracts), except in the
case of clauses (b) and (c) only for any violations, breaches, defaults or
other matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prohibit or materially impair Sellers or a Selling Subsidiarys
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Financial Information_. Section 3.3 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter sets forth (a) the unaudited combined balance sheets of the Nordisk

material respects the financial condition and the results of operations of the
Business as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such
Financial Information, all in accordance with GAAP, subject, in the case of
interim Financial Information, to normal recurring year-end adjustments, the
absence of footnotes and the use of accounting practices, principles and

(b) None of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV owns any real property.

 



 

(c) Each Real Property Lease is valid and in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms of such Real Property Lease, subject to proper
authorization and execution of such Real Property Lease by the counterparties
thereto and to the Bankruptcy and

 



      
 

 



 

Equity Principles. There is no breach or default under any Real Property
Lease, and to Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred that, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a breach or default
by any Acquired Company, the Satair JV or any other party thereto under any
Real Property Lease, except in each case to the extent such breach or default
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Business Assets_.

 



 

(a) Seller, a Selling Subsidiary, an Acquired Company or the Satair JV owns,
leases or has the legal right to use all of the Business Assets (excluding the

Assets (excluding the Leased Real Property, which is the subject of Section
3.5, and Intellectual Property, which is the subject of Section 3.14), except
for Permitted Encumbrances and for such defects of title or restrictions on
use that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except for the Excluded Assets, the
Business Assets, together with the rights granted to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any other agreements to be entered
into pursuant hereto or thereto, will constitute on the Closing Date all of
the assets necessary to conduct the Business in the same manner in all
material respects as the Business is presently conducted.

 



 

(b) Except as reflected in the Financial Information, the tangible assets
included in the Business Assets (excluding the Leased Real Property, which is
the subject of Section 3.5) are in satisfactory and serviceable condition,
subject to normal wear and tear and impairments of value that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Litigation_. Section 3.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets
forth each action, suit or proceeding pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened, against Seller, an Acquired Company, the Satair JV or a Selling
Subsidiary with respect to the Business, at law, in equity or otherwise, in,
before, or by, any court or Governmental Authority. There are no material
unsatisfied judgments or material outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees,
stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a court, an administrative agency
or by an arbitrator) against any of the Business Assets or against Seller, an
Acquired Subsidiary, the Satair JV or a Selling Subsidiary with respect to the
Business.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Law_. The Business is being conducted in all
material respects in compliance with all applicable Laws. (i) All United

Letter, are in full force and effect and are being

 



      
 

 



 

complied with in all material respects. Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
cause the termination or cancellation of, or give to others any right to
terminate or cancel, any of the Authorizations. None of the Acquired
Companies, the Satair JV, Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries has received
notice in writing that it is in material violation or default under any
Authorization or, in relation to the Business, that it is in material
violation of, or default with respect to, any Law, in each case, that is
unresolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is
made under this Section 3.8 in respect of any (i) employee benefit matters
which are addressed exclusively in Section 3.13 (as to which no representation
or warranty is made except as set forth in Section 3.13), (ii) intellectual
property matters which are addressed exclusively in Section 3.14 (as to which
no representation or warranty is made except as set forth in Section 3.14),

expected payments in excess of $2,500,000 during the remaining term; (b) for

the date of this Agreement and under which any Acquired Company or the Satair
JV has any continuing material liability or obligation; (g) relating to the
sale or disposition of any material Business Assets (other than the sale of

referred to collectively herein as the " _Significant Contracts_." Each
Significant Contract is valid and is in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of such Significant Contract subject to proper authorization
and execution of such Significant Contract by the counterparties thereto and
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles and neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will

 



      
 

 



 

give others any rights of termination or cancellation of any Significant
Contract. There is no material breach or material default under any
Significant Contract, and to Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred that,
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a
material breach or material default by Seller, an Acquired Company, the Satair
JV, any Selling Subsidiary or any other party thereto under, or give to others
any rights of termination or cancellation of (other than rights relating to
contractual expiration), **** any Significant Contract.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, do not and will not require any consent,
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with or notification to,
any Governmental Authority, except (a) as set forth in Section 3.10 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, (b) where the failure to obtain such consent,
approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or notification,
would not prevent or materially delay the consummation by Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and (c) as may be necessary as a result of facts or
circumstances relating solely to Buyer and its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Acquired Company Capital Stock_. (a) The authorized and issued
capital stock (or equivalent equity interests) of each Acquired Company (the "
_Acquired Company Group Shares_ ") is as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. Seller, the Acquired Companies and the Selling
Subsidiaries (considered collectively) are the record and beneficial owners of
all of the Acquired Company Group Shares. The Acquired Company Group Shares
have been validly issued and, where applicable, are fully paid and non-
assessable. None of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or the Acquired Companies
is party to any shareholders agreements, voting trusts or proxies, with
respect to the voting of the Acquired Company Group Shares and there are no
outstanding warrants, options, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities
or other Contracts (other than this Agreement) pursuant to which Seller, an
Acquired Company or a Selling Subsidiary is or may become obligated to issue,
sell, purchase or redeem any Acquired Company Group Shares.

interests owned by the Acquired Companies in each of the Joint Ventures.

stoppage or any union organizing effort by or with respect to the Transferred
Employees.

(a) Each Seller Plan and each Acquired Company Plan (collectively, the "
_Benefit Plans_ ") is listed in Section 3.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure

copies of each Benefit Plan, including any trust instruments, annual reports,
determination letters and insurance contracts forming a part of any such
Benefit Plan, and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available
to Buyer.

 



 

(b) None of Seller, any Selling Subsidiary, the Satair JV or any Acquired
Company or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (i) has any currently
outstanding material liability under Section 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA
with respect to any Benefit Plan, which could reasonably be expected to become
a liability of Buyer; and (ii) has any currently outstanding material
withdrawal liability, within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA, with
respect to any Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), which could
reasonably be expected to become a liability of Buyer.

 



 

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
each Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund) has
been established, maintained, funded and administered in all material respects
in accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and complies in all material
respects in form and in operation with the requirements of applicable Laws.

each Benefit Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified
plan" under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter (or opinion letter to the extent applicable) from the IRS as to its
qualification, and to Sellers Knowledge no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such
qualification. None of Seller, any Acquired Company, the Satair JV, any
Selling Subsidiary, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or, to Sellers
Knowledge, any fiduciary of any Benefit Plan has ever engaged in any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code with respect to a Benefit Plan that could result in a
material excise tax under the Code.

 



 

(e) There are no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened claims,
actions, proceedings, or litigation with respect to any Benefit Plan (other

Knowledge, no Benefit Plan is under audit or investigation by any Governmental
Authority.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
none of Seller, any Selling Subsidiary, the Satair JV, any Acquired Company or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintains, sponsors or contributes to
or, within the past six (6) years, has maintained, sponsored or contributed to
any Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. To Sellers Knowledge, no event or omission has
occurred, or condition currently exists, that could reasonably be expected to
result in or require any withdrawal (complete, partial or mass) from a
Multiemployer Plan. No event has occurred and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in any tax, lien, fine, penalty or other
liability imposed on any Acquired Company under ERISA, the Code or other
applicable Laws by reason of being an ERISA Affiliate. Except as provided in
this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

in Section 5.4, no Acquired Company or Joint Venture has or could reasonably
be expected to have liability for any employee benefit plan other than the
Acquired Company Plans.

applicable Laws and (B) any determinations or approvals required to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) each employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement that is required to be maintained
or contributed to by any Acquired Company or Joint Venture pursuant to the
applicable Laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States has been so
maintained or contributed to.

 



 

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or in connection with any other event) entitle any employee,
officer, director or independent contractor of Seller, any Selling Subsidiary,
any Joint Venture or any Acquired Company to severance pay or benefits under,
or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger
any other material obligation pursuant to, any Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) Other than as set forth in this Section 3.13, Seller does not make any
other representations or warranties, either express or implied, with respect
to any matters relating to employees or employee benefits or matters
pertaining to any Law relating thereto.

 



 

Section 3.14 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Set forth in Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter is a list of all
issued Patents, registered Trademarks, registered Copyrights and all
applications for the same, included in the Intellectual Property owned by
Seller, a Selling Subsidiary, the Satair JV, or an Acquired Company and, in
each case, which are included in the Business Assets. All such listed
Intellectual Property is, to Sellers Knowledge, valid and enforceable. The
Acquired Companies have taken reasonable measures to protect the proprietary
nature of each material item of Intellectual Property owned by an Acquired
Company and which is included in the Business Assets. Except for the Seller
Trademarks, the items identified in Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, and the rights granted to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and any other agreement to be entered into pursuant
hereto or thereto, none of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV) owns any
Intellectual Property that is necessary to conduct the Business in the same
manner in all material respects as the Business is presently conducted.

 



 

(b) Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists all material licenses,
sublicenses, consents and other Contracts (i) by which an Acquired Company is
authorized to use any of the Intellectual Property (other than currently
available, unmodified, off-the-shelf computer programs that are licensed
pursuant to "shrink wrap," "click wrap" or other similar commercially
available standard form licenses and for which the applicable Acquired Company
has paid or will pay a total amount or value less than $75,000) which is
included in the Business Assets, and (ii) by which an Acquired Company
licenses or otherwise authorizes a third party to use any material
Intellectual Property owned by an Acquired Company and which is included in

 



      
 

 



 

the Business Assets (the "IP Contracts"). To Sellers Knowledge, (a) each IP
Contract is valid and is in full force and effect in accordance with the terms
of such IP Contract subject to proper authorization and execution of such IP
Contract by the counterparties thereto and to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Principles and (b) there is no breach or default under any IP Contract, and no
event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute a breach or default by an Acquired Company or any other
party thereto under any IP Contract.

 



 

(c) To Sellers Knowledge, none of the making, having made, using, copying,
preparing derivative works of, importing, offering to sell, sale or other
distribution of products or services of the Business in the manner so done by
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing or any other activity currently
undertaken by the Acquired Companies in connection with any such product or
service or the operation of the Business infringes or otherwise violates any
Intellectual Property of any third party. None of Seller, any Selling
Subsidiary nor any Acquired Company has received any written notice from any
other Person challenging any Acquired Companys right to use any of the
Intellectual Property listed in Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
or used in connection with the Business that is material to the operation of
the Business as currently conducted and which remains outstanding. None of
Seller, a Selling Subsidiary or an Acquired Company has brought any pending
claim that any Person is violating or infringing upon the Intellectual
Property listed in Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter and to
Sellers Knowledge, no other Person is materially violating or infringing
same.

 



 

(d) An Acquired Company owns all right, title and interest in and to, or has a
license, sublicense or permission to use, all of the Intellectual Property (i)
necessary to make, have made, use, copy, prepare derivative works of, import,
offer to sell, sell and otherwise distribute all products and services of the
Business in the manner so done or to use the Internal Systems as they are
currently used in the Business, or (ii) otherwise used in the Business, free
and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), except as
would not, in each case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prohibit or materially impair Sellers or a Selling
Subsidiarys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. All such material Intellectual Property and the IP
Contracts will be owned or available for use by the Acquired Companies in
connection with the Business immediately following the Closing on
substantially identical terms and conditions as it was immediately prior to
the Closing without payment of additional fees.

 



 

(e) The representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.14 shall be
the exclusive representations and warranties with respect to the infringement
of third-party Intellectual Property and, notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, no other representation or warranty is made
in this Agreement with respect to the infringement of third-party Intellectual
Property.

 



 

Section 3.15 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for the retention of Jefferies and
Company, Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Seller in
accordance with Section 9.4, neither Seller nor any of the Acquired Companies
has employed any broker, finder or investment banker who would have a valid
claim for a fee or commission from Buyer or, following Closing, any Acquired
Company or Joint Venture, or incurred any liability for any brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission for which Buyer or, following Closing, any

 



      
 

 



 

Acquired Company or any Joint Venture would be liable, in each case in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.16 _Environmental Representations_. (a) Except as disclosed in the
environmental reports and audits listed in Section 3.16 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (copies of which have been made available to Buyer prior to
the date of this Agreement):

 



 

(i) The Business Assets and the Acquired Companies are in material compliance
with all applicable Environmental Laws and all material permits,
certifications, licenses, approvals, registrations and authorizations required
by such Environmental Laws (" _Environmental Permits_ ").

 



 

(ii) None of Seller, the Acquired Companies, the Satair JV or the Selling
Subsidiaries have received in connection with the Business Assets any
unresolved written notice of any citation, summons, order, complaint, penalty
or investigation by any Governmental Authority (i) with respect to any alleged
material violation by Seller, a Selling Subsidiary, an Acquired Company or the
Satair JV of any Environmental Law, (ii) with respect to any alleged failure
of Seller, a Selling Subsidiary, an Acquired Company or the Satair JV to have
any material Environmental Permit or (iii) with respect to any disposal or
Release of any Hazardous Substance in amounts or concentrations requiring
investigation or cleanup under Environmental Law, and, to Sellers Knowledge,
no facts, conditions or circumstances exist with respect to the operation of
the Business Assets that are reasonably likely to give rise to a material
liability under Environmental Laws.

 



 

(b) Seller has provided complete copies of all environmental reports, audits,
studies, and material assessments in its possession related to the Business
Assets prepared since January 1, 2008 by or on behalf of Seller, the Acquired
Companies and the Selling Subsidiaries, including any such reports, audits,
studies or assessments related to the Business Assets prepared since January
1, 2008 by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or other third party.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.16 shall be
the exclusive representations and warranties with respect to environmental
matters (including environmental liabilities or obligations, Environmental
Laws, Environmental Permits and Hazardous Substances) and, notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no other representation or
warranty is made in this Agreement with respect to environmental matters.

applicable extension periods) all Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV and has paid or caused to
be paid all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns and any other material
Tax required to be paid by the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV. Such Tax
Returns are accurate and complete in all material respects. No presently
effective waivers or extensions of statutes of limitation with respect to
material Taxes have been

 



      
 

 



 

given with respect to an Acquired Company or the Satair JV for any taxable
years. None of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV has any agreement with
any Person regarding the filing of Tax Returns or relating to the sharing of
material Tax benefits or liabilities with such Persons. None of the Acquired
Companies or the Satair JV is currently the subject of any audit or
examination or other legal proceeding with respect to Taxes.

Buyer and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles,
and no other proceedings on the part of Buyer are necessary to authorize this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. At
Closing, the Ancillary Agreements will be duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Buyer and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Seller or a Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, will constitute legal, valid
and binding agreements of Buyer, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles.

 



 

Section 4.2 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor compliance by Buyer with its terms and provisions will violate
(a) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other
similar organizational document of Buyer; (b) assuming all of the consents,
approvals, authorizations, filings or notifications to or of Governmental
Authorities contemplated by Section 4.3 are made or obtained, any Law or any
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority to which Buyer is
subject, except, in all cases, for such violations that would not prohibit or
materially impair Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or (c) result in any breach of,
or constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any encumbrance on Buyer except in any such case for any
violations, breaches, defaults or other matters that would not prohibit or
materially impair Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Buyer do not and will not
require any consent, approval, authorization or other action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (a) where the
failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make
such filing or notification, would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and (b) as may be necessary as a result of facts or
circumstances relating solely to Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.4 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for the retention of such Persons,
the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Buyer in accordance with

available to it at Closing, immediately available funds sufficient to pay the
Purchase Price and to otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Regulatory Matters_. Buyer is not subject to any enforcement
action, citation, consent decree or other similar action by any Governmental
Authority that might materially affect its or Sellers or a Selling

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Investment_. Buyer is acquiring the Shares solely for the purpose
of this investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any

Buyer acknowledges the Shares are not registered under the Securities Act or
any state or non-U.S. Law of similar effect, and that the Shares may not be
transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of such
Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom as applicable. Buyer is
an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) promulgated under
the Securities Act. Buyer has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters and investments in general that make it capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of purchasing the Shares. Buyer acknowledges that it has

necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of Seller, the
Selling Subsidiaries and the Acquired Companies concerning the merits and
risks of investing in the Acquired Companies; (b) access to information about
the Acquired Companies, their respective results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow, and business, in each case sufficient to enable Buyer
to evaluate whether to proceed with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the purchase of the Shares; and (c) the opportunity to obtain
such additional information that either Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
the Acquired Companies possess, or can acquire without unreasonable effort or
expense, that is necessary to make an informed investment decision with
respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the purchase of the Shares.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. There is no suit, investigation, action or other
proceeding pending or, to Buyers knowledge, threatened before any court,
arbitration tribunal, or judicial, governmental or administrative agency,

representatives to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to (x) the offices, facilities, properties and

its Affiliates operations, activities or employees, or if such access would,
in the reasonable judgment of Seller after conferring with Buyer, violate
applicable antitrust or similar laws. With respect to any Persons with which

a direct or indirect contractual relationship, and any Governmental
Authorities with jurisdiction over or that regulates Seller, any Selling

other proceeding by any person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking
to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) Buyer and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or

participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry by such Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it

Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting.

be transferred out of the Business by way of dividend or otherwise prior to
Closing.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Post-Closing Obligations of the Business to Certain Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Transferre_ _d Employees_. Buyer shall make offers of employment to those
employees of Seller and its Affiliates who are employed in connection with the
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date (such employees who are offered
and accept employment with Buyer, the " _Business Employees_ ," and together
with employees of any Acquired Company, as of the Closing Date, the "
_Transferred Employees_ "). For at least one year following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide compensation and benefit levels for the Transferred
Employees that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation
and benefit levels provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Buyer Benefit Plans_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that all Transferred Employees are given credit for all years of
service with Seller, an Acquired Company or a Selling Subsidiary (or service
credited by Seller, an Acquired Company or Selling Subsidiary) prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals) under the employee benefit

 



      
 

 



 

plans of Buyer in which the Transferred Employees become eligible to
participate after the Closing Date (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that such service shall be recognized only to the extent that it
was recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan and does not result in
duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted under the terms of the Buyer
Benefit Plans and to the extent that any Transferred Employee is otherwise
eligible to participate in the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, and waiting periods
applicable to Transferred Employees, other than any such requirements that
would not have been satisfied under the corresponding Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with
credit for any eligible expenses paid by such Transferred Employee on or prior
to the Closing Date during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs
under the corresponding Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying any
deductibles, copayments and maximum out of pocket requirements under any Buyer
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) _Seller Plans and Acquired Company Plans_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, all Transferred Employees shall cease to actively participate in all
Seller Plans that are not Acquired Company Plans. Seller shall retain
liability for the Seller Plans that are not Acquired Company Plans, including,
but not limited to, liability for claims arising in connection with any
individuals employment with Seller and its Affiliates (except for the Seller
Plans listed in Section 5.4(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which Buyer
shall assume as to any Transferred Employee). Nothing contained in this
Section 5.4 is intended to limit Buyers ability to modify, amend or terminate
any Acquired Company Plan in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(d) _COBRA_. Seller shall retain responsibility for providing Business
Employees, who terminated employment prior to or on the Closing Date and who
elected group health coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code ("
_Continuation Coverage_ ") under the terms of the group health plan maintained
by Seller, with such Continuation Coverage. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be responsible for providing Continuation Coverage to Transferred
Employees who experience a "qualifying event" under a group health plan
maintained by Buyer or an Acquired Company following the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) _Employee Access_. After the Closing, Buyer will permit Seller (and its
Affiliates) to have access to Transferred Employees that Seller or its
Affiliates may reasonably need in order to defend or prosecute any legal or
administrative action to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party and
which relates to the conduct of the Acquired Companies or Selling Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing, except where such access would, under the circumstances,
unreasonably interfere with Buyers, the Acquired Companies, or their
respective Affiliates operations, activities or employees, or if such access
would, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer after conferring with Seller,
violate applicable laws.

 



 

(f) _Bonus Plans_. Buyer shall pay, or shall cause an Acquired Company to pay,
an aggregate bonus amount to Transferred Employees for the fiscal year in
which the Closing occurs in an amount no less than the amount accrued on the
Closing Statement with respect to short-term or annual incentives or bonuses,
commissions, and similar amounts attributable to Transferred Employees for the
fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, with the timing of such payments to
be made consistent with past practice but, in any event, no later than 2.5
months following the end of such fiscal year.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _General_. Nothing set forth in this Section 5.4 shall (i) confer any
rights or remedies upon any Transferred Employee or upon any other Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
(ii) constitute an amendment to or a promise to amend any benefit plan or any
other plan or arrangement covering the Transferred Employees or any other
Person, or (iii) obligate Buyer or any Acquired Company to continue the
employment of any Transferred Employee for any specific period.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Books and Records_. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or cause the Business to, retain all Contracts
and Books and Records relating to Taxes and Transferred Employees and to make
the same available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Seller
or its agents at Sellers expense, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
notice.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth
in this _Section 5.6_, nothing in this Agreement grants or shall be deemed to
grant to Buyer the right to use or any interest in (i) the name "Teleflex",
"TFX" or any trademark, trade name, service mark, corporate name, domain name,
logo or other source indicator containing the same names and/or a name
confusingly similar thereto (which, for clarity, does not include the "Telair"
trademark) (collectively, the " _Seller Trademarks_ ") or (ii) any other
Intellectual Property of Seller and its Affiliates that is not included in the
Business Assets.

 



 

(b) Commencing one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall use any signs or stationery, purchase
order forms, packaging or other goods or supplies, advertising and promotional
materials, product, training and service literature and materials, or any
other materials in any format or medium (" _Supplies_ ") that contain any
Seller Trademarks. After the Closing Date Buyer shall not reorder, produce or
reproduce any Supplies that include the Seller Trademarks. For one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller grants to the Acquired
Companies a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except to
Affiliates of the Acquired Companies) license to use the Seller Trademarks,
solely in a high-quality manner that is consistent with past practice.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the Closing Date but no later than within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cease all use of the
Seller Trademarks and shall take all such actions as may be required to change
the name of Teleflex Aviation Products AS to one that does not comprise or
contain the Seller Trademarks, including filing a name change amendment with
the jurisdiction of incorporation and filing an appropriate name change notice
in the appropriate office in each jurisdiction where such entity is qualified
to do business.

 



 

(d) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it is not acquiring any right,
title or interest in (i) the stylized "T" used in the "Teleflex" and "Telair"
trademarks, (ii) the "T" shape of the "Teleflex" and "Telair" marks, and (iii)
the type fonts used in the "Teleflex" and "Telair" marks (collectively, the "
_Stylized T Elements_ "), regardless of whether any registration owned or to
be owned by the Acquired Companies contain such Stylized T Elements. For three
(3) years **** after the Closing Date, Seller grants to the Acquired Companies
a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except to Affiliates of
the Acquired Companies) license to use

 



      
 

 



 

the Stylized T Elements, solely in a manner that is consistent with past
practice and solely in connection with the Business. The nature and quality of
all goods and services provided by the Acquired Companies in connection with
the Stylized T Elements will conform to the quality of the goods and/or
services as provided by Seller or the Acquired Companies, as applicable, prior
to the Closing Date. Buyer and the Acquired Companies acknowledge that the
license in this Section 5.6(d) is transitional in nature, and that the
Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transition
away from substantially all uses of the Stylized T Elements promptly.

 



 

(e) Prior to or at Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, transfer all of its right, title and interest in the
Intellectual Property listed in Section 5.6(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
to one of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Further Assurances; Cooperation_.

 



 

At any time after the date of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or take any
other actions reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and
necessary for Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, to satisfy its obligations
hereunder. Seller and Buyer shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to their respective obligations set
forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied at or prior to Closing.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Compliance with WARN, EU Directives, etc._

 



 

Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all losses, claims and
liabilities arising out of any real or alleged violation of WARN or any
similar Law based on Buyers failure to offer employment to, hire or retain
any Transferred Employees.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Foreign Implementing Agreements_.

 



 

If, after the date of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer mutually agree or deem
it advisable, or if otherwise necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, Seller and Buyer shall cause to be prepared and, prior to
or on the Closing Date, executed by the applicable parties, any additional
agreements or instruments implementing the transfer and conveyance to Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer at the Effective Time of the Shares or the Air Cargo
Assets and the assumption by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer of the Assumed
Liabilities (the " _Foreign Implementing Agreements_ "). The parties agree
that any Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not expand or limit the rights
and obligations of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, beyond those provided for in this
Agreement, and that the Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not provide for
any additional rights or obligations of Seller or Selling Subsidiaries, or
Buyer or its Affiliates that are not provided for in this Agreement. The
parties shall cooperate in the preparation of any such Foreign Implementing
Agreements, which shall be prepared in a form suitable for use by the parties
in such foreign jurisdiction. In the event of any conflict between the terms
of any such Foreign Implementing Agreements and this Agreement, the parties
agree and acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement shall control and that,
if necessary, the parties shall deliver such additional instruments as may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Disclosure; Investigation_.

 



 

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller has not made, does not make and
specifically negates and disclaims any representations, warranties, promises,
covenants, agreements or guaranties of any kind or character whatsoever,
whether express or implied, oral or written, past, present, or future, except
as (and solely to the extent) specifically set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Covenant Not to Compete; Non-Solicit_.

 



 

(a) Seller agrees that during the Seller Non-Compete Period, neither Seller
nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall engage, manage, operate or have any
ownership interest in any firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship or
other business entity that engages in, manages or operates a business that
competes with the Business (each, a " _Competing Business_ ") anywhere in the
world; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this
Section 5.11(a) for Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates (i) to own,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person that
are traded on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a
recognized securities exchange outside the U.S.) if Seller or any of its
controlled Affiliates (x) is not a controlling Person or a member of a group
that controls such Person and (y) does not, directly or indirectly, own more
than 5% or more of the voting securities of such Person, (ii) to acquire,
directly or indirectly, the equity or assets of, or otherwise become
affiliated with or participate in, any enterprise that derives less than 25%
of its total annual revenue from a Competing Business, if Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to divest, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within eighteen (18) months after the closing date of such acquisition),
its interest in such enterprise relating to the Competing Business, (iii) to
continue operating existing lines of business, other than the Business, or any
of the Excluded Assets or (iv) to perform the activities contemplated by the
Ancillary Agreements. None of the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) shall
operate to prohibit, hinder, impede or restrict from engaging in a Competing
Business in any way, any Person which by way of takeover, acquisition, merger,
combination or similar transaction acquires a controlling or significant
interest in Seller or any of its Affiliates (provided that Seller and its
controlled Affiliates as of the date of such transactions shall continue to be
subject to the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) after any such transaction).

 



 

(b) The " _Seller Non-Compete Period_ " shall mean the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the three (3) year anniversary
of the Closing Date or (ii) the date Buyer and its Affiliates cease to engage
in the Business.

 



 

(c) Seller agrees that during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the earlier of (i) the date that is eighteen months following the
Closing Date or (ii) the date Buyer and its Affiliates cease to engage in the
Business, none of Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates will solicit for
employment, seek to employ or employ (including in any consulting capacity)
any Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not prohibit Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from (w) engaging in
general solicitations for employees not specifically targeted at the
Transferred Employees (and employing any Transferred Employees who respond to
such general solicitations) or (x) soliciting or employing any Transferred
Employee who is no longer employed by Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If any provision contained in this Section 5.11 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is in the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained in this Section 5.11 is held to cover a geographic area or to be for
a length of time which is not permitted by Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.11 to provide for a covenant
having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such Law.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller
and the Selling Subsidiaries with the provisions of any so-called bulk
transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale to Buyer of the
Air Cargo Assets.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, Seller shall, at Sellers sole cost and expense,
cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV for taxable periods ending
prior to or on the Closing Date, including amended returns, applications for
loss carryback refunds and applications for estimated Tax Refunds (all such
Tax Returns, amended returns and refund applications are referred to as the "
_Prior Period Returns_ "). The Prior Period Returns shall be prepared, where
relevant, in a manner consistent with Sellers past practices except as
otherwise required by Law. Seller shall pay all Taxes related to such Prior
Period Returns (other than any Taxes for which Buyer is liable pursuant to
Section 5.13(g)). Buyer shall make available to Seller (and to Sellers
accountants and attorneys) any and all books and records and other documents
and information in its possession or control relating to the Acquired
Companies and the Satair JV reasonably requested by Seller to prepare the
Prior Period Returns. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, for its review at least
thirty (30) days prior to the applicable filing deadline for a Prior Period
Return, a draft of such Prior Period Return. Seller shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments of Buyer on such Prior Period Return.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Companies and the
Satair JV for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date and, subject to
the right to indemnification under Section 5.13(c), shall pay all Taxes
related thereto. Buyer shall prepare all Straddle Period Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with Sellers past practices, except as otherwise required
by Law. Buyer shall deliver to Seller, for its review and comment, a draft of
each Straddle Period Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the
applicable filing deadline of such Straddle Period Tax Return, together with a
proposed calculation of the Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period, and
Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Seller on such
Straddle Period Tax Returns.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.13(g),
and Section 8.4, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and the Acquired
Companies and the Satair JV (with respect to the Satair JV, to the extent of
Buyers direct or indirect equity interest therein) harmless from and against
the following Taxes (and all other related Losses): (i) any Taxes of Seller or
any Selling Subsidiary; (ii) any Taxes that related to the Air Cargo Assets or
the Transferred Employees for any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date); (iii) any
Taxes of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV for periods ending on or
before the Closing Date; (iv) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies and/or the
Satair JV allocable to the Pre-Closing Period of a Straddle Period Tax Return;
(v) any Taxes of any other person for which any of the Acquired Companies
and/or the Satair JV may become liable pursuant to Treas. Reg. section
1.1502-6 (or analogous provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law) as a result
of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of
corporations prior to the Closing Date; (vi) any Taxes that the Acquired
Companies and the Satair JV are liable for as a transferee or successor, which
arise as a result of a transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing, and
all Income Taxes that the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV are liable for
pursuant to any contract (other than this Agreement) entered into by the
Acquired Companies or the Satair JV (or assumed by the Acquired Companies or
the Satair JV) on or prior to the Closing; and (vii) without duplication any
Taxes resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty in Sections
3.12, 3.13 or 5.3 or this Section 5.13; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not indemnify Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and/or the Satair JV from and against, any Taxes for which Buyer is
liable pursuant to Section 5.13(g) or to the extent such Taxes are reflected
in the Final Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller following receipt of any notice of
audit or other proceeding relating to any matter for which Seller may be
required to indemnify Buyer, the Acquired Companies and/or the Satair JV
pursuant to Section 5.13(c). No failure or delay in providing such notice
shall reduce Sellers obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent
the failure or delay shall have actually prejudiced Seller. Seller shall have
the right, at its sole cost and expense (including all reasonable out of
pocket expenses incurred by the applicable Acquired Company or Satair JV), to
control any audit or proceedings, and the filing of any amended Tax Return,
relating to any Acquired Company or the Satair JV for a period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, (i) Seller shall give prompt
notice of its intent to control such audit or other proceedings; (ii) Seller
shall control such audit or other proceeding diligently and in good faith;
(iii) Buyer shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to participate
in such audit or proceedings; and (iv) Seller shall not settle, resolve or
otherwise abandon such audit or proceedings without the prior written consent
of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Buyer shall control all
audits or proceedings relating to any Acquired Company or Satair JV for any
Straddle Period and all audits and proceedings for any Acquired Company or
Satair JV for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date until Seller has
provided notice of its intent to control under this Section 5.13(d); provided,
however, (i) Buyer shall control such proceedings diligently and in good
faith; (ii) Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, have the right to
participate in such audit or proceedings; and (iii) Buyer shall not settle,
resolve or abandon any such audit or proceedings that relates to a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Period without the
prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) For purposes of determining Sellers obligation for Taxes that relate to
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the
parties agree as follows: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by
multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes (including Income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as if the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV
filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a
"closing of the books methodology." For purposes of clause (ii) above, any
item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

(f) All refunds of Taxes of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date (or portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with the same
principles provided for in Section 5.13(e)) (whether in the form of cash
received from the applicable Governmental Authority, a credit against Taxes
otherwise payable or similar benefit for any Tax period (or portion of a
Straddle Period) beginning on or after the Closing Date) shall be the property
of Seller. To the extent that Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV
receives a refund that is the property of Seller, Buyer shall pay to Seller
the amount of such refund (without interest other than interest received from
the Governmental Entity), net of any Taxes (including any withholding Taxes
that would be payable on a distribution by the Acquired Companies or the
Satair JV of the amount of the refund to Buyer) and any out-of-pocket expenses
that Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Satair JV or any of their Affiliates
incur with respect to such refund (and related interest). The net amount due
to Seller shall be payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of credit
or other benefit, ten (10) days after filing the Tax Return claiming or
realizing such credit or other benefit). To the extent a refund that gave rise
to a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed, or otherwise reduced or
lost, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Taxes that Buyer, the Acquired
Companies, the Satair JV or any of their Affiliates incurs as a result of such
disallowance, reduction or loss (and any related interest or penalties and
other Losses). Nothing in this Section 5.13(f) shall require Buyer to make any
payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV) that is with
respect to: (i) any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of
any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in a
taxable period after the Closing Date (or portion of any Straddle Period
beginning on the Closing Date); (ii) any refund of Tax resulting from the
payments of Taxes made on or after the Closing Date to the extent Seller has
not indemnified Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV for or
otherwise paid such Tax; (iii) any refund for Tax that is reflected as an
asset (or an offset to a liability) in the calculation of Net Working Capital;
(iv) any refund for Buyers allocable share of any Transfer Taxes as
determined under Section 2.7; or (v) any refund for Tax to the extent that
such refund gives rise to any payment obligation by an Acquired Company or the
Satair JV to any person other than the Acquired

 



      
 

 



 

Companies, Satair JV, Buyer or any of their Affiliates pursuant to a provision
of a Contract that was entered into by an Acquired Company or the Satair JV
prior to the Closing.

 



 

(g) Buyer shall pay and indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any Taxes of Seller and its Affiliates (including any Taxes
of the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV for which Seller or any of its
Affiliates may become liable pursuant to Treas. Reg. section 1.1502-6 (or
analogous provisions of state or local law) as a result of its being a member
of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations that included any
of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV prior to the Closing Date)
resulting from any actions taken, or caused to be taken, by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates following the Closing (other than any transactions pursuant to
this Agreement or in the ordinary course of the Acquired Companies business)
with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV.

 



 

(h) Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as may be reasonably requested of the other in filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Seller and Buyer agree that the Books and
Records delivered to the control of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement to the
extent they relate to the operations of any of the Acquired Companies or the
Satair JV prior to the Closing Date, remain in existence and available, Seller
(at its expense) shall have the right upon prior notice to inspect and to make
copies of the same at any time during business hours for any proper purpose.
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts not to destroy or allow the destruction of
any such Books and Records without first offering in writing to deliver them
to Seller.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this Section 5.13 shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the obligation under this
Section 5.13 is a Tax that any Acquired Company or the Satair JV is liable for
under a Contract, such obligation shall not terminate prior to the date that
is thirty (30) days after the date on which such obligation terminates under
such Contract.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Credit Support_. Buyer acknowledges that in the course of the
conduct of the Business, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries may have entered
into various arrangements (a) in which guarantees (including of performance
under Contracts included in the Business Assets, letters of credit or other
credit arrangements, including surety and performance bonds) were issued by,
or for the account of, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries or (b) in which
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries are the primary or secondary obligors on
debt instruments or financing or other contracts or agreements, in any such
case to support or facilitate transactions of the Business. Such arrangements
by such parties are set forth in Section 5.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
and are hereinafter referred to as the " _Credit Support Arrangements_."
Seller and Buyer agree that the Credit Support Arrangements are not intended
to continue after the Closing. Buyer agrees to (i) obtain replacement Credit
Support Arrangements, which will be in

 



      
 

 



 

effect at the Closing, (ii) repay, or cause the repayment of, all debt and
other obligations to which such Credit Support Arrangements relate (and cause
the cancellation of such Credit Support Arrangements) or (iii) arrange for
itself or one of its subsidiaries to be substituted as the obligor thereon as
of the Closing Date and, in each case, obtain the release of Seller and its
Affiliates from any such Credit Support Arrangements. If Buyer cannot obtain
the release of Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies)
from any such Credit Support Arrangements but the Closing still occurs, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold Seller and such Affiliates harmless for any Losses
incurred by Seller or such Affiliates from and after the Closing with respect
to such Credit Support Arrangements.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Section 338(g) Elections_. Buyer shall have the right to make
an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the acquisition
of the Acquired Company Group Shares or any interests in the Joint Ventures.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Termination of Certain Intercompany Accounts_. Seller hereby
agrees that effective as of the Closing, except for (i) the Ancillary
Agreements and the other agreements and instruments required to be delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto and (ii) the Contracts disclosed in Section 5.16 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, it shall take all necessary action to cause all
Contracts, commitments or transactions, except for any trade accounts payable
or trade accounts receivable, between the Business, on the one hand, and
Seller and/or and any of its controlled Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies and the Joint Ventures), on the other hand, to be terminated and
cancelled without any further liability and obligation and to be of no further
force or effect.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Notification; Updates to Seller Disclosure Letter_.

 



 

(a) During the period between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of:

 



 

(i) the discovery by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary of any event, condition,
fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that caused or constitutes a breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller in this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists
after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement if (A) such
representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence,
existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, or (B)
such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on
or prior to the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of Seller in this
Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that may make the timely
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(f) impossible or
unlikely.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) During the period between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller in writing of:

 



 

(i) the discovery by Buyer of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that
occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused
or constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in
this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists
after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement if (A) such
representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence,
existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, or (B)
such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on
or prior to the date of this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is required to be
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.17(a) requires any change in the Seller
Disclosure Letter or if any such event, condition, fact or circumstance would
require such a change assuming the Seller Disclosure Letter were dated as of
the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition,
fact or circumstance, then Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer an update to
the Seller Disclosure Letter specifying such change. Except for updates to the
Seller Disclosure Letter to add Real Property Leases, Significant Contracts,
labor agreements or collective bargaining agreements, issued Patents,
registered Trademarks, registered Copyrights and applications for the same, IP
Contracts and insurance coverage and claims history, in each case entered
into, issued, registered or obtained, as applicable, following the date of
this Agreement and prior to Closing and which are not prohibited by Section
5.3 of this Agreement, no such update shall be deemed to supplement or amend
the Seller Disclosure Letter for the purpose of (i) determining the accuracy
of any of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other Contract referred to in this Agreement, (ii) determining
whether any condition set forth in _Article VI_ has been satisfied or (iii)
determining Sellers obligations under _Article VIII_. Any noncompliance
with the notification and update provisions of this Section 5.17 shall not
constitute failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ or give rise to
any right of termination under _Article IX_ unless the underlying change or
event shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a
right.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Mutual Release_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Acquired Companies from
any and all liabilities and obligations to Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
in respect of rights of contribution or indemnification), in each case whether
absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and whether arising under
any agreement or understanding, or the certificates of incorporation,

 



      
 

 



 

bylaws, memoranda of association, articles of association, or other
constitutive documents of the Acquired Companies and the Selling Subsidiaries
or otherwise at law or equity. The foregoing waiver, release and discharge
shall not apply in respect of any liability or obligation (i) arising under
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or (ii) arising after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies to
irrevocably waive, release and discharge Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
from any and all liabilities and obligations to the Acquired Companies of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including in respect of rights of contribution or
indemnification), in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding, or the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws, memoranda of association, articles of
association, or other constitutive documents of the Acquired Companies or
otherwise at law or equity. The foregoing waiver, release and discharge shall
not apply in respect of any liability or obligation (i) arising under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or (ii) arising after the
Closing.

their directors, officers, employees and stockholders (collectively, the "
_Buyer Parties_ ") against and in respect of any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fines, Taxes, reasonable costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ") actually
sustained, incurred or suffered by the Buyer Parties, to the extent resulting
or arising from (i) any breaches of Sellers representations and warranties
set forth in Article III of this Agreement or (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of Seller set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates and any
of their directors, officers, employees and stockholders in their
representative capacities (collectively, the " _Acquired Company Parties_ ")
against and in respect of any and all Losses actually sustained, incurred or
suffered by the Acquired Company Parties, to the extent resulting or arising
from any dispute with Anders Helmner or Lena Patent AB with respect to the
Patent Agreement (as in effect prior to Closing), including but not limited to
any current or future arbitration or similar proceeding with Anders Helmner or
Lena Patent AB with respect to the Patent Agreement (as in effect prior to
Closing). Buyer and Seller agree that Seller shall control the prosecution of
any arbitration or any other proceeding with Anders Helmner or Lena Patent AB
with respect to the foregoing and shall provide updates regarding the status
of any such proceeding to Buyer upon request.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date and subject to Section 8.1, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries, their Affiliates
and their directors,

 



       
 

 



 

officers, employees and stockholders (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ")
against and in respect of any and all Losses actually sustained, incurred or
suffered by the Seller Parties, to the extent resulting or arising from (i)
any breaches of Buyers representations and warranties set forth in Article IV
of this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement or (iii) the operation of the Business or the Business
Assets or actions taken by or on behalf of Buyer after the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Any indemnification payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by Law.
Such amount shall, to the extent attributable to a specific Air Cargo Asset,
be allocated to the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Air
Cargo Asset, as determined pursuant to Section 2.8.

 



 

(e) Any claims for indemnification for Taxes shall be exclusively governed by
and brought pursuant to Section 5.13.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Method of Asserting Claims, etc._ In the event that any written
claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to any
Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from
any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly,
but in no event more than twenty (20) business days following such Indemnified
Partys receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of such
claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent
then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such claim and demand) (the " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , that the failure
to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have
materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
have sixty (60) days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice
(the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it
desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. An
election to assume the defense of such claim or demand shall not be deemed to
be an admission that the Indemnifying Party is liable to the Indemnified Party
in respect of such claim or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of,
and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_. In the event that it is ultimately determined
that the Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold the
Indemnified Party harmless from and against any third party claim, the
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in its defense of the third party claim. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period
that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand,
except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings. If any Indemnified
Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense or
settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party
shall not settle a claim or demand without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such claim or demand on a basis which would result in the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof. To the extent the Indemnifying Party

 



      
 

 



 

shall control or participate in the defense or settlement of any third party
claim or demand, the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel access to, during normal business hours, the relevant business
records and other documents, and shall permit them to consult with the
employees and counsel of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
use its best efforts in the defense of all such claims. Any notice of a claim
by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement shall state specifically the representation, warranty, or
covenant with respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to an
alleged basis for the claim, and the estimated amount of the liability
asserted against the Indemnifying Party by reason of the claim.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Amounts_. Seller shall not have liability under
Sections 8.2(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of Buyers Losses attributable
to indemnification claims for which a Claim Notice was properly delivered to
Seller pursuant to Section 8.3 exceeds $4,200,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "),
in which case Buyer shall be entitled to Losses attributable to
indemnification claims in an amount up to $56,000,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Cap Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be liable only for
the amount by which all Losses (up to the Cap Amount) exceed the Basket
Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that no individual claim for payment of a
Loss may be made under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless such claim (together with any
related claims) is an amount of $25,000 or greater (the " _Individual Claim
Threshold_ "). For purposes of this _Article VIII_ (including determining
whether a breach has occurred), the representations and warranties of Seller
(other than Section 3.4, clause (ii) of the second sentence of Section 3.8,
clauses (f) and (g) of the first sentence of Section 3.9, Section 3.17 and,
solely for clarification, other than dollar thresholds) shall not be deemed
qualified by any references to materiality or to Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Individual Claim Threshold, the Basket
Amount and the Cap Amount shall not apply to any claim for a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.6(a) (only the
first sentence thereof), 3.11, 3.15 and 3.17 and (ii) the Basket Amount shall
not apply to any claim for a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.13 and the Individual Claim Threshold with respect to
any such claim (together with any related claims) shall be deemed to be
$10,000 or greater.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._

 



 

(a) With respect to any matter covered by this Article VIII, the Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assert all claims under all
applicable insurance policies (provided that such commercially reasonable
efforts shall not require the commencement or pursuit of any litigation,
arbitration, or other dispute resolution process); provided that the
Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this Article VIII in respect of such Losses and to be
paid therefor before resolution of any insurance payment. The amount of any
Losses of the Indemnified Party for purposes of this Article VIII shall be net
of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party (net of
(i) reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to collection under
such insurance policies, (ii) the deductible associated therewith and (iii)
co-payments and similar obligations) and, to the extent that insurance
proceeds are collected by the Indemnified Party after an indemnification claim
has been settled, the Indemnified Party will restore the Indemnifying Party to
the same economic position as would have existed had such insurance proceeds
been collected prior to the settlement of such claim (net of (i) reasonable,
out-of-pocket

 



      
 

 



 

costs and expenses relating to collection under such insurance policies, (ii)
the deductible associated therewith and (iii) co-payments and similar
obligations).

 



 

(b) In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have no liability in respect of
any such Losses (i) to the extent they arise or are incurred as a result of
the passing of, or a change in, any law or administrative practice of a
Governmental Authority enacted after the Effective Time or (ii) if they would
not have arisen but for any act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried
out at the request of or consent of the Indemnified Party before Closing.

 



 

(c) The parties shall take and shall cause their Affiliates to take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



 

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Article VIII to an
Indemnified Party for Losses to the extent such Indemnified Party received the
benefit of such Losses in the calculation of the adjustments to Purchase Price
or the Adjustment Payment.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following Closing, except in the case of
fraud, and except to the extent of non-monetary equitable relief (including
specific performance) made with respect to breaches of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed following the Closing,
the indemnification obligations in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive
remedy for breaches of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 8.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or
otherwise responsible to any Indemnified Party for consequential, incidental,
unforeseen or punitive damages or for diminution in value or loss of profit
that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the performance or breach
thereof or any liability retained or assumed hereunder other than damages paid
to an unaffiliated third party claimant.

 



 

Section 8.8 _No Set-Off_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to
set-off any Losses (including indemnification obligations under Section 8.2)
against any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, or otherwise.

 



 

 _ARTICLE IX_ 
MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
February 29, 2012 (the " _End Date_ "); provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to a
party that has breached in any material respect its obligations under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement in any manner that shall have primarily caused the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date;

 



 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Authority shall have issued a statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or
injunction or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 



 

(d) by Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to the
other party, if there has been a breach by such other party of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, which breach is the
sole cause of the failure of the conditions in _Article VI_ to be satisfied,
and such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of the End Date and the date
which is thirty (30) days after the breaching partys receipt of written
notice of such breach (and provided that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement is not then in material breach of this Agreement).

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers
or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in
this Section 9.2 and in Sections 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12,
and 9.13 and except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability
for any willful breach of any representation or failure to perform any
covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Collection of Receivables or Excluded Assets_. If, following
Closing, Seller or any Selling Subsidiary receives a payment that constitutes
a Business Asset, Seller shall promptly pay such amount to Buyer. If,
following Closing, Buyer or any Acquired Company receives a payment that does
not constitute a Business Asset, Buyer or the Acquired Company, as the case
may be, shall promptly pay such amount to Seller.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Expenses_. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the parties shall
bear their own respective expenses (including all compensation and expenses of
counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent
accountants) incurred in connection with the preparation and execution of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
filing fees.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as provided in the following sentence, this Agreement may not
be assigned by any party hereto without the express prior written consent of
the other party. Buyer may assign or delegate its rights, obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement in whole or in part to a subsidiary of Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, Buyer shall remain fully liable
for the fulfillment of all such obligations and liabilities hereunder. Any
attempted assignment or delegation in contravention hereof shall be null and
void.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Rights_. This Agreement (along
with the Seller Disclosure Letter) and the Ancillary Agreements (a) constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement); and (b) are not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement (and with
respect to the rights under Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) only, the Buyer Parties
and Seller Parties, respectively) any legal or equitable right, remedy, or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, this
Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
assigns. The parties acknowledge that both Buyer and Seller participated in
the drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and agree that any
rule of law or any legal decision that may or would require interpretation of
any alleged ambiguities in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements against
the party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. In the
event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement
(including the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification
provisions hereof) and the terms of any other documents delivered or required
to be delivered in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
terms of this Agreement shall supersede such conflicting or inconsistent terms
(including, by way of illustration and not limitation, an instance where a
warranty in a deed of transfer imposes, implicitly or explicitly, greater
obligations on the grantor than are imposed by the terms of this Agreement) in
such other documents and the terms of this Agreement shall define the rights
and obligations of the parties and their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders and Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of
such conflict or inconsistency.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Disclosure Letters_. The disclosures made in any section of the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be made with respect to (i) the
corresponding representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and (ii) any
other representation or warranty of Seller to the extent (solely in the case
of this clause (ii)) such disclosure reasonably relates to such other
representation or warranty. Inclusion of any matter in any section of the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an
admission by Seller or otherwise imply that any such matter is material, has a
Material Adverse Effect or creates a measure for, or further defines the
meaning of, materiality or Material Adverse Effect and their correlative terms
for the purposes of this Agreement. Any capitalized and undefined term used in
any section of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall have the same meaning
assigned to such term herein.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Section Headings_. The article, section and paragraph headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in
any, way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Notices_ _._ All notices hereunder shall be deemed given if in

Section 9.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to the choice of law principles thereof, except to the extent
matters of title, leasing, and similar _in_ _rem_ issues require the
application of the laws of jurisdiction in which an applicable facility of an
Acquired Company is located and which is the subject matter of the legal
dispute. Seller and Buyer hereby agree and consent to be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court
located in the State of Delaware and hereby waive the right to assert the lack
of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection
with any such suit, action or other proceeding. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the parties (a) waives the

 



      
 

 



 

defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to commence any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (c) agrees that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other

INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTIES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUIT OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NEITHER IT
NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT

Section 9.12 _Illegality_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Public Announcements_. AAR CORP., Buyer and Seller agree not to
make any public announcements or issue any press releases in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of Seller (in
the case of AAR CORP. and Buyer) or Buyer (in the case of Seller), which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided,_ _however_ , that the
parties may make any such announcements or statements which such party has
been advised by counsel may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation
(including stock exchange regulations).

 



 

Section 9.14 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for
any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Guarantee_. By its execution below, AAR CORP., a Delaware
corporation, does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the full
and timely payment by Buyer of the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms
