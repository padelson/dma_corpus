vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of March
14, 2007, among Pitney Bowes Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ "),
Magellan Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "), and MapInfo Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

_Introduction_

This Agreement contemplates the acquisition of the Company by the Parent on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
Purchaser will make a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, $0.002 par
value per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price of $20.25
per share of Company Common Stock, net to the seller in cash, without
interest thereon (the " _Offer Consideration_ "), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Following consummation of the
Offer, the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the " _Merger_
"). As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent. The Boards of Directors of each of the Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company have approved and declared advisable the Offer and
the Merger and adopted this Agreement.

The Parent, the Purchaser and the Company therefore agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE CASH TENDER OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. Provided that nothing
shall have occurred that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a
right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in
Annex I, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event within seven business days of the day on which the Purchasers
intention to make the Offer is publicly announced (which announcement will be
made by the Parent on March 15, 2007), the Purchaser shall commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase any and all
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price equal to the Offer
Consideration. On the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, the Purchaser shall accept
for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer and shall pay for all such shares promptly after
acceptance. The obligation of the Parent and the Purchaser to commence the
Offer and to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn shall be subject
only to the conditions set forth in Annex I to this Agreement. (b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendments; Subsequent Offering Period_.
The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day after
commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and
14d-2 under the Exchange Act). The Purchaser expressly reserves the right,
subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to waive, amend or modify any
term or condition of the Offer in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_
, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall
not:

(i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the Offer
Consideration or decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
pursuant to the Offer;

(ii) extend the expiration date of the Offer, except (A) as required by
applicable law (including for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof), (B) in connection with an
increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to
comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, or (C) as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) waive the Minimum Condition;

(iv) amend the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I or any other
material term thereof in any manner adverse to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock; or

(v) impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in Annex I.

If the Offer shall not have been consummated at the scheduled expiration
thereof due to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in Annex I (that the Parent or the Purchaser has not waived hereunder),
the Parent will, at the request of the Company, cause the Purchaser to extend
the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not in excess of 10
business days each) but in no event later than September 14, 2007. The
Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period (not in excess of ten business days) for the Offer
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act following its acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer.

(c)  _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), a form of
the related letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),
and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). The Parent and the Purchaser agree that the Offer
Documents shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and, on the date first filed with the
SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances  



 

2  under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by the Company or any of its stockholders in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable law, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable,
the Offer Documents and to cause the Schedule TO as so amended and
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so amended
and supplemented to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Parent and the Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written comments
or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Parent, the Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Company and its
counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall provide the
Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses thereto and
telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of the Parent or the
Purchaser or their counsel.

(d) _Provisions of Funds by the Parent_. The Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to the Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary
to purchase any and all shares of Company Common Stock that the Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(e) _Tax Withholding_. The Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Offer any transfer tax due and any other amounts as
the Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, reasonably determines
that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or under any other applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Purchaser or the Exchange Agent to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Approval and Consent_. The Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. Contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
 



 

3  Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") and disseminate the Schedule
14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and any other applicable laws, to the holders of Shares. Except as required by
applicable law or as otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 6.1 below,
the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any duly constituted
committee thereof, the " _Company Board_ ") in favor of the Offer and the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of such recommendation. The Company agrees that the Schedule
14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and on the date first filed with the
SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied by the Parent or the Purchaser in writing specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the
Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable law, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Parent and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC or dissemination to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
The Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel with a copy of any
written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Parent and
its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall provide the
Parent and its counsel with a copy of any written responses thereto and
telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company or its
counsel.

(c) _Provision of Information for Offer Documents_. The Company shall
promptly supply to the Parent and the Purchaser in writing, for inclusion in
the Offer Documents, all information concerning the Company required under
applicable U.S. federal securities laws to be included in the Offer Documents
or that may be reasonably requested by the Parent and the Purchaser in
connection with the preparation of the Offer Documents.

(d) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall promptly furnish to the Purchaser or its designated agent
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date and, to the extent known, a
list of the beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock as of a
recent date, together with copies of all security position listings and all
other computer files and other information in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock,
and shall furnish to the Purchaser  



 

4  such information and assistance (including updated lists and information) as
the Purchaser may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the
Offer to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
date of this Agreement, all such information concerning the Companys record
and, to the extent known, beneficial holders shall be made available to the
Purchaser. Subject to the requirements of applicable laws and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent and the Purchaser
shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the information
contained in any of such labels and lists, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession or under their control.

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) _Election of Purchaser Designees_. Promptly after the first time at which
the Purchaser accepts for payment, and pays for, any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and from time to time
thereafter as shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment and
paid for by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such
number of members of the Company Board (the " _Purchaser Designees_ "),
rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give the Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number
of members of the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Parent or the
Purchaser at such time (including shares of Company Common Stock so accepted
for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of
the Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts promptly (and in any event
within one business day) either to increase the size of the Company Board or
to secure the resignations of such number of the Companys incumbent
directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Purchaser Designees to be so
elected or appointed to the Company Board and the Company shall take all
actions available to the Company to cause the Purchaser Designees to be so
elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by the
Purchaser, also take all action necessary to cause persons designated by the
Purchaser to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each subsidiary of
the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of
directors.

(b) _Compliance with Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1_. The Companys obligations

part of the Schedule 14D-9. The Parent and the Purchaser shall supply to the
Company in writing any information with respect to the Parent, the Purchaser
and the Purchaser Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.



 

5 (c) _Independent Directors_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that at least two of the members of the Company Board shall,
at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined below), be directors of
the Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "
_Independent Directors_ "), provided that, if there shall be in office fewer
than two Independent Directors for any reason, the Company Board shall cause
the person designated by the remaining Independent Director to fill such
vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of
this Agreement, or if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill
such vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or affiliates of
the Parent or the Purchaser and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time, if any,
that the Purchaser Designees constitute a majority of the Company Board and
prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or
modification of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the
Company, any extension of time for performance of any of the obligations of
the Parent or the Purchaser hereunder, any waiver of any condition to the

rights or remedies hereunder, any amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, any authorization of any agreement between the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or the taking of any
other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Company Board may

whole) there are in office one or more Independent Directors and such action
is approved by a majority of the Independent Directors then in office.

THE MERGER; TOP-UP OPTION; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Parent and the Company shall jointly

established by the Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

2.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Parent and the
Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the  



 

6  conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of items to be
delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that
the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such
items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of WilmerHale, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless
another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Parent and the
Company. For purposes of this Agreement (except Section 1.1), a " _Business
Day_ " shall be any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on
which banking institutions located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or
required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed.

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Purchaser shall cease and the Purchaser shall be merged with and into
the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (b) the certificate of incorporation
of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be amended in
its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit A, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.8(b) hereof, the
Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit B, and, as so
amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

2.5 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

2.6 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.6(b) and Section 2.6(c), the Company grants to the
Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the
number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_
") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Purchaser as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share
more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of
shares (i) in excess of the aggregate of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held as treasury shares by the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to
issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not otherwise reserved for issuance) as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option or (ii) that would require the
Company to obtain stockholder approval under applicable securities exchange
listing standards.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by the Purchaser, in whole but not in
part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any
subsequent offering period. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-
Up Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up
Option Shares by the Offer Consideration. Such purchase price shall be paid
by the Purchaser in cash.



 

7 (c) In the event that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth the place and time at
which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by the Purchaser
is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
the Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares, and the
Company shall cause to be issued to the Purchaser a certificate representing
such shares.

(d) The Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares
that the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not
be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. The Parent and the Purchaser
represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, or will be upon
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an " _accredited investor_ ", as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

2.7 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Purchaser:

(a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock of the
Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $0.002 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or any other wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of the Parent or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.8,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.7(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.10(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $20.25 in cash per
share (or any such higher price per share of Company Common Stock as may be
paid in the Offer) without any interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.7(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.8.



 

8 (d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

2.8  _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Parent
and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section
2.8, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.7(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Parent pursuant to Section 2.8(d).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
" _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid
promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to
a Person (as defined in this Section 2.8(b)) other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have  



 

9  been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.8. As used in this Agreement,
" _Person_ " means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, trust, Governmental Entity,
unincorporated organization or other entity.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II, subject to Section 2.8(d).

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time (including, without limitation, all interest and
other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this
Section 2.8 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, without interest.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Dissenting Shares
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company  



 

10  Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent or the Exchange Agent may
require delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any claim that may
be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to any such
Certificate.

2.9 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option plans or
other equity-related plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") to
be accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all Company
Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options); and

(iii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Company
Stock Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely the right to
receive, in accordance with this Section 2.9, a lump sum cash payment in the
amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect to
such Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase
Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

(b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the Parent, in
respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option so cancelled,
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not
later than five Business Days), an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per
share of Company Common Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any
interest thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that the
exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and have
no further force or effect.

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a
letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options
pursuant to this Section 2.9 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Stock Options. The Parent shall at all times from
and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its
obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.9.

(d) The Company and the Company Board shall take all steps necessary to
effectuate the exercise of all outstanding options granted pursuant to the
1993 Employee Stock  



 

11  Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ ") pursuant to the terms
thereof (including notice to each holder of options) on a date determined by
the Board, which date shall be not less than ten (10) days preceding the
Closing, and as of or prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
terminate the Company ESPP. No later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall provide notice to the Parent of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock purchased upon exercise of such options in
accordance with the Company ESPP and this paragraph.

2.10 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL
(any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time
as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal
rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.7, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.7, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificate formerly representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument unless the Parent shall have given its written consent to
such payment or settlement offer.

association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company, other

which the underwriters have reserved their rights.

dated the date of this Agreement and addressed to the Special Committee and
the Board of Directors of the Company, to the effect that, as of such date,

have arisen in connection with investments in or acquisitions of companies or
businesses.

Companys customary terms, (v) take any action other than in the Ordinary
Course of Business to fund or in any other way secure the payment of

terms, except as expressly modified herein.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof
(the " _Specified Time_ "), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other
advisors and representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly induce or encourage, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or



 

35 (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information
for the purpose of encouraging, facilitating or inducing, the making of any
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including Section 6.1(f)), in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this Agreement and that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors) could be reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), the Company may (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company to any Person (and the
Representatives of such Person) making such Acquisition Proposal, pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive of the other party
than the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
(including solicitation of a revised Acquisition Proposal) with such Person
and its Representatives regarding any such Acquisition Proposal, and (C)
amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock.

(b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Prior
to the Specified Time:

(i) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent, the approval
or recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the Company Voting
Proposal;

(ii) the Company shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement or arrangement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
") providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section
6.1(a)); or

 

(iii) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the
Parent, its recommendation with respect to the Company Voting Proposal or
approve or recommend a Superior Proposal if and only to the extent that, after
complying with the notice provisions in this Section 6.1 (including Section
6.1(d)), if applicable, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. Promptly (and in any
event no later than 24 hours) following a determination by the Company Board
that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall deliver to the Parent a written notice advising the Parent that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal together with a copy of any
such Superior Proposal if in writing, specifying (to the extent not previously
done under Section 6.1(d)) the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal. If,
following the expiration of three Business Days after Parents receipt of such
notice of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal specified in such notice
still  



 

36  constitutes, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, a Superior
Proposal and did not otherwise result from a material breach of this Section
6.1, the Company, by action of the Company Board, may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e), provided that, concurrently with such termination,
the Company pays to the Parent the fee described in Section 8.3(b). In
determining whether the Superior Proposal specified in such notice still
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to the notice of a
Superior Proposal. 

(c) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys
stockholders on the Company Voting Proposal at the Company Meeting shall not
prior to the termination of this Agreement be limited or otherwise affected
by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal). The Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal), prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

(d) _Notices to the Parent_.

(i) Upon the Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, advise the Parent orally, with
written confirmation to follow, of the Companys receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, and shall provide to Parent a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any amendments or modifications
thereto, if in writing.

(ii) After receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall (A)
continue to keep the Parent informed, on a prompt (and in any event no later
than 24 hours) basis, as to all material amendments thereto, and (B) promptly
(and in any event no later than 24 hours) provide to the Parent a copy of all
written non-public materials subsequently provided by the Company to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal (to the extent that the Company has not previously provided such
materials to the Parent).

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or
in Section 6.5 (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall be deemed to prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

(f) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct
its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal.

offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets
outside the Ordinary Course of Business, tender offer, recapitalization, share
exchange or other business combination involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than mergers,
consolidations, recapitalizations, share exchanges or other business
combinations involving solely the Company and/or one or more Subsidiaries of
the Company, and no other party) (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the
Company of over 20% of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer

made by a third party to acquire more than 50% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation or a sale of its assets,
(i) on terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock (in their capacity as stockholders) than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any offer by the Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement), (ii) is not subject to any financing contingency
or, if so subject, that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment is reasonably likely of being financed, and (iii) which the Company
Board has determined in its good faith judgment to be reasonably capable of

all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

6.2 _Proxy Statement_. If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock is required under the DGCL in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company, at the Parents request following the
consummation of the Offer and in cooperation with the Parent, shall prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall give to Parent the opportunity to review and comment on
the initial preliminary Proxy Statement and all subsequent forms or versions
of or amendments to the Proxy Statement and the Company shall take into good
faith consideration all of Parents reasonable comments to each version of or
amendment to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond to any comments
of the SEC or its staff and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the resolution of any
such comments. The Company shall notify the Parent promptly upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials
and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,  



 

38  the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the
other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of the
Company, such amendment or supplement.

6.3 _Nasdaq Quotation_. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the quotation of the Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq
Stock Market during the term of this Agreement.

6.4 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall

not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (including Tax returns
and, to the extent permitted by the Companys independent auditors, following
a request by the Company that such permission be granted, workpapers of the
Companys independent auditors), officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives as the Parent shall reasonably
request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Parent (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, assets and personnel as the Parent may reasonably request. The
Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board and in accordance with Section
6.1(c) hereof, shall at the Parents request following the consummation of
the Offer take all actions in accordance with applicable law, its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to
promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable, the Company Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting
upon the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.1, (a) the Company
Board shall recommend adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the
stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (b) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject
to Section 6.1, the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and
lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company
Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company
required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the DGCL to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Parent, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the Companys stockholders, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company
Meeting is  



 

39  originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting, or (iii) for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.

(b) The Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Parent or any Subsidiary (including all shares purchased by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer) to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
at the Company Meeting.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser or any Subsidiary of the
Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.6(b), the
Company and the Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, subject to any

thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law; and 

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith. The Company and the Parent shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable law (including all information required to
be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the  



 

40  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such disclosure of
information may be made, on the advice of each of the Company and the
Parents counsel, on a counsel-only or outside counsel-only basis.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government
clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or
decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust
Laws_ "), and to respond to any government requests for information under any
Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, and where feasible will
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto, in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law, subject to advice of
counsel to each of the Company and the Parent and to the provisions of any
disclosure as contemplated by Section 6.6(a) hereof.

(c) Each of the Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect prior to or after
the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the Company nor the
Parent shall be required to make any payments in connection with the
fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.6.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the Parent
a duly executed certificate and associated documentation meeting
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by applicable law or stock
market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon
by the Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall
each use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
and provide such other party with an opportunity to review and comment before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement.

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against  



 

41  all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable
fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) business days of receipt
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of
a request therefor, provided that any such Indemnified Party provides an
undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advancement if
it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. 

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation so to contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company.

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO Insurance_") with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the
annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 250%, the " _Maximum Premium_
"), which annual premium is set forth in Section 6.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting
period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a " _Reporting
Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect
for its full term. If the Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated
or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability
insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the
Company does not pay more than six times the Maximum Premium for such
Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that the Parent causes the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full
force and effect for its full term, the Parent shall be relieved from its
obligations under the preceding two sentences of this Section 6.8(c).

(d) The Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.8
unless it is ultimately determined that the person was not entitled to such
indemnification.



 

42 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. 

6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, (b) any
material failure of the Parent and Purchaser or the Company, as the case may
be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, (c) any change, occurrence or event which,
individually or in the aggregate with any other changes, occurrences and
events, is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to closing set
forth in Article VII not to be satisfied, or (d) any material notice or other
suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation by or before
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against it or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.10 _Employee Benefits and Service Credit_. From and after the Effective
Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as such Continuing Employees
remain so employed, health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those provided to similarly situated employees of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries under the Parent Employee Plans (as defined
below). Following the Effective Time, the Parent will give each Continuing
Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to
the extent such service is recognized by the Company under a similar Company
Employee Plan for purposes of (w) eligibility and vesting under any Parent
Employee Plans, (x) determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee
Plan or policy relating solely to vacation or severance and (y) determination
of "retiree" status under any Parent Employee Plan, in each case for which
the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing
Employee is offered participation, but except where such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Parent shall waive, or cause
to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions
to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
the Parent and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent
Employee Plan_ " means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is a defined contribution plan, any "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as  



 

43  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan,
agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance
benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options,
stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive
compensation or post-retirement compensation, for the benefit of, or relating
to, any current or former employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or any entity which is a member of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as
defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses
under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an
affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code or the
regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or
included the Parent or a Subsidiary of the Parent; provided, however, that
for the avoidance of doubt, Parent Employee Plan shall not include any defined
benefit pension plan or any plan providing for post-retirement medical or
other welfare benefits.

6.11 _Certain Severance Payments_. Immediately prior to the Closing (or on the
date which is six months and one day following the Closing Date, if required
by Section 409A of the Code), and subject thereto, the Company shall make lump
sum cash payments to the employees of the Company whose names are shown on the
list made available to the Parent pursuant to Section 3.14(k), each in an
amount shown adjacent to each such employees name on such list and net of
federal, state and local withholding taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments, subject to a general release (or releases) of all
claims of any kind whatsoever that the employee may have against the Company,
known or unknown as of the Closing Date (and as of the date of payment as
required by Section 409A of the Code, as the case may be) (other than claims
under COBRA, and claims to vested accrued benefits under the Companys tax-
qualified retirement plans) to be executed in each case by the Company and the
employee, in such form as the parties shall reasonably agree. The parties
intend for such payments to be in lieu of all severance, termination or
change-in-control payments pursuant to employment, severance, or change in
control agreements in effect between the Company and the employees, other than
as relates to the Company Stock Options.

Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (with respect
to Sections 8.1(b) through 8.1(g), by written notice by the terminating party
to the other party), whether before or, subject to the terms hereof, after
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (to the extent
required by applicable law):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company; or

(b) by either the Parent or the Company if the Offer shall not have been
consummated by September 14, 2007 (the " _Outside Date_ ") (provided that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Offer to be consummated on or before the Outside Date); or

(c) by either the Parent or the Company if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling
or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect
of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance
for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer or consummation of the Merger; or

(d) by the Parent, prior to the purchase of any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, if: (i) the Company Board shall have failed to
recommend the tender of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
in the Schedule 14D-9 or approval of the Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy
Statement or shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of the Offer
or the Company Voting Proposal in a manner adverse to the Parent; (ii) the
Company Board shall have approved, endorsed or recommended to the stockholders
of the Company an Acquisition Proposal (other than the Offer and the Merger);
or (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been commenced (other than by the Parent or an
Affiliate of the Parent) and the Company Board shall have recommended that
the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or, within 10 Business Days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, the Company Board shall have failed to recommend
against acceptance of such offer; or



 

45 (e) by the Company, if the Company Board, pursuant to and in compliance with
Section 6.1, shall have approved or recommended to the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal, provided that the Company simultaneously
pays the fee described in Section 8.3(b); or

(f) by the Parent, prior to the purchase of any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would cause the conditions set forth in clauses (iii)(e) or (iii)(f) of
Annex I not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured within 30
days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from the Parent; or

(g) by the Company, prior to the purchase of any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach of or failure
to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Parent or the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform shall have had or is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and shall
not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the Parent of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Company.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Parent, the
Company, Purchaser or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or
Affiliates; provided that (a) any such termination shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement (the parties
acknowledging that no measure of damages, if proven, shall be deemed waived or
excluded by the execution of this Agreement or the terms hereof) and (b) the
provisions of Sections 5.2 (Confidentiality) and 8.3 (Fees and Expenses),
this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX (Miscellaneous) of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the
Offer or the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay the Parent a termination fee of $14,165,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e); or

(iii) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if the failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in clause (iii)(e) of Annex I due to a willful breach of
any of the representations and warranties of the Company or any fraudulent
conduct by the Company or clause (iii)(f) of Annex I by the Outside Date shall
have resulted in the Closing not occurring or  



 

46  by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b), but only if in any such case (x)
before the date of such termination, the Company shall have received
an Acquisition Proposal that shall not have been withdrawn and (y) within 12
months after the date of termination, the Company shall have consummated or
entered into any definitive agreement to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal with the Person who made, and on
the terms of, such Acquisition Proposal;

_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this Section 8.3(b), all
references to "20%" in the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be
deemed to be references to "50%"; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to pay any Termination Fee if, at the time of
termination of this Agreement, Parent or Purchaser is in material breach of
this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be paid to the
Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the
date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(ii)
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement by the Company Board pursuant to Section
8.1(e). Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(iii) shall be paid to the Parent by
wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the date on
which the transaction referenced in clause (y) of Section 8.3(b)(iii) is
consummated.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3
shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this
Agreement described in clause (a) of Section 8.2, but otherwise shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any
termination of this Agreement.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.3(c) hereof, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of any
party, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c) hereof, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other
communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
messenger service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless
and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any
party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth. 

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements,
undertakings or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of
them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the
parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior
understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.8 (with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries),
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent may assign, in its sole discretion, all or any of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Parent
with the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve the
Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the  



 

49  term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.8  _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any
party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10  _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



 

50 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or of any federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any other court, and (e) expressly waives, and agrees
not to plead or to make claim that any such action or proceeding is subject
(in whole or in part) to a jury trial. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto
may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided
for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law.

9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENT THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND
COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN
PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS SECTION 9.12 WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS CONSENT THAT ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY
A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall each be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business.

9.14 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Company s Knowledge_" means the actual knowledge as of the date hereof of
the individuals identified in Section 9.14 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

52 _ANNEX I_

_CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_

_Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Agreement") of which this Annex I is a part._

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer, and may terminate or amend the Offer in a manner consistent with
the terms of the Agreement, and may postpone the acceptance of, or payment
for, any shares of Company Common Stock in a manner consistent with the terms
of the Agreement, if:

(i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended
in accordance with the Agreement), the number of shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, together with any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent, does
not equal at least a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of purchase (where "on a
fully diluted basis" means the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding, together with the shares of Company Common Stock which the
Company may be required to issue pursuant to warrants, options or other
obligations outstanding at that date under employee stock or similar benefit
plans or otherwise, at prices equal to or less than the Offer Consideration
whether or not vested or then exercisable) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(ii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) and any approvals or clearances applicable to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust
Laws or as otherwise required by any Governmental Entity shall have expired,
or been terminated or obtained, as applicable; or

(iii) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the
expiration of the Offer, any of the following shall occur and be continuing:

(a) other than the filing of the Certificate of Merger, any authorization,
consent, order or approval of, or declaration or filing with, or expiration
of waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Offer or the Merger and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, the failure of which to file, obtain or occur
is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company
Material Adverse Effect, shall not have been filed or obtained or shall not
have occurred on terms and conditions which would not reasonably be likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(b) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive order,
stay,    decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule
or regulation which is in effect and which has the effect of making the Offer
or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement;

(c) there shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding in which a
Governmental Entity is (i) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement or make materially more costly the making of the
Offer, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any material respect the Parents
or the Purchasers ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends with respect
to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of the
Surviving Corporation, or (iii) seeking to prohibit or impose any material
limitations on the ownership or operation by the Parent (or any of its
Subsidiaries) of all or any portion of the businesses or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to compel the Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation to dispose of or hold separate any
portion of the businesses or assets of the Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries;

(d) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred;

(e) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement shall not be true and correct as of such time as though made on and
as of such time (except (i) to the extent such representations and warranties
are specifically made as of a particular date, in which case such
representations and warranties shall not be true and correct as of such
date, (ii) for changes contemplated by the Agreement, and (iii) where the
failure to be true and correct (without regard to any materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein), individually or in
the aggregate, has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect);

(f) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect
any covenant or obligation required to be performed or complied with by it
under the Agreement;

(g)(i) the Company Board shall have failed to recommend the tender of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in the Schedule 14D-9 or shall
have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of the Offer in a manner adverse
to the Parent; (ii) the Company Board shall have approved, endorsed or
recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal (other
than the Offer and the Merger); or (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been commenced (other
than by the Parent or an Affiliate of the Parent) and the Company Board shall
have recommended that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in
such tender or exchange offer or, within 10 Business Days after
the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board shall
have failed to recommend against acceptance of such offer;



 

2 (h) the Parent and the Purchaser shall not have received a certificate
executed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
confirming that the conditions set forth in clauses (e) and (f) of this Annex
I have been duly satisfied; or

(i) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Parent and the
Purchaser and, subject to the terms of the Agreement, may be waived by the
Parent or the Purchaser (except for the Minimum Condition), in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time, in their respective sole discretion.
The failure by the Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to any particular facts and circumstances shall
not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and
each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

SIXTH: The Board of Directors is authorized to make, alter or repeal the by-
laws of the corporation. Elections of directors need not be by written

SEVENTH: Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors
for breaches of fiduciary duty, no director of the corporation shall be
personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision
of law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision
shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of
such director occurring prior to such amendment.

EIGHTH: 1. _Action, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation_. The corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation),
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the    request of the corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a
similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons
being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action
alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys fees) judgment, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if
he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, except as set forth
in Section 6 below, the corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of
Directors of the corporation. 

---|--- 



   2. | _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The
corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become,
a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer or trustee
of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or
by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her
behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of Delaware shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the
case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware
shall deem proper. 
---|--- 



   3. |

_Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been
successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or
proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified against all expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or
her behalf in connection   
  therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding
is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition
without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the
Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the
corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv)
an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner
he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an
adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes
hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

---|--- 


   4. | _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to
his or her right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the corporation
in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation involving him or her for which indemnity will or could be
sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which
the corporation is so notified, the corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.
After notice from the corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so
to assume such defense, the corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4.
The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in
connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred
after notice from the corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof
shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of
counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the corporation, (ii) counsel
to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict
of interest or position on any significant issue between the corporation and
the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the
corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for
the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the corporation, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The corporation shall not be
entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any
claim brought by or in the right of the corporation or as to which counsel
for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in
clause (ii) above. 
---|--- 



   5. |

_Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in the
event that the corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4
of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the
corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be
paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter;
provided, however, that the payment of such expense incurred by an Indemnitee
in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all
amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be   
  determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking shall be accepted
without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such
repayment. 

---|--- 



   6. | _Procedure for Indemnification_. In order to obtain
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of
this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to the corporation a written
request, including in such request such documentation and information as is
reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or
advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60
days after receipt by the corporation of the written request of the
Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the
corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day
period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made
in each instance by (a) a majority vote of the directors of the corporation
consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), even though less than a
quorum, (b) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of
all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which
quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to
the action, suit or proceeding in question, (c) independent legal counsel
(who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation), or (d) a court of
competent jurisdiction. 
---|--- 


   7. | _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advances as granted
by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of
competent jurisdiction if the corporation denies such request, in whole or in
part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred
to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advanced of
expenses under this Article shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure
of the corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because
the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. The Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the corporation. 
---|--- 



   8. |

_Subsequent Amendment or Legislation_. No amendment, termination or repeal of
this Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law
of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way
the rights of any Indemnitee to   
  indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any
actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal. If the General Corporation Law of Delaware
is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the
indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the corporation shall
indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended. 

---|--- 


   9. | _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his
or her official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the
corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers
and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from
those set forth in this Article. In addition, the corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the corporation and such rights may be equivalent to,
or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article. 
---|--- 



   10. | _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under
any provision of this Article to indemnification by the corporation for some
or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or
on his or her behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and any appeal, therefrom but not, however, for the total
amount thereof, the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee
for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled. 
---|--- 



   11. | _Insurance_. The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan)
against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation law of Delaware. or consolidated with another corporation and the corporation is not the
surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations
of the corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or
consolidation. 
---|--- 



   13. | _Savings Clause_. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the
corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this
Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. 
---|--- 


   14. | _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h)
and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section
145(i).
