share of Company Common Stock, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (the &#147;<U>Offer Consideration</U>&#148;), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Following consummation of the Offer, the
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;). As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent.
