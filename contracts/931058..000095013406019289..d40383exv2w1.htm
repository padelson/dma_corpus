state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or local Law, cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to close
their Income Tax period on the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to close their Income Tax period on the Closing Date, the amount of Income Taxes
allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any allocation of

shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing

shall be allocated as follows: (i)&nbsp;real, personal and intangible property Taxes shall allocated in
proportion to the number of days in each such period and (ii)&nbsp;Taxes (other than Income Taxes and
