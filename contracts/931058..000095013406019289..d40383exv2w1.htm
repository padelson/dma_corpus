their briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each
item remaining in dispute and the amount of the Closing Working Capital, and
the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each
such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Working Capital, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Independent Accounting Firm that
it reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 3.4(d)_. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be KPMG, LLP or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by Seller and Purchaser. Seller
and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the
matters submitted to it within twenty (20) Business Days following

may be entered upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting
Firm in any court referred to in _Section 10.3_. The costs of any dispute
resolution pursuant to this _Section 3.4(d)_ , including the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any enforcement of the
determination thereof, shall be borne by the parties in inverse proportion

the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted. The fees and disbursements of the representatives of each party
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Post Closing
Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement,
as applicable, shall be borne by such party. 

   

 (e) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows: 

    

 (i) if the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ is greater than the Initial Closing Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Working Capital and the Initial Closing Working Capital, and Purchaser shall pay such amount to Seller, and 

   

 (ii) if the Initial Closing Working Capital is greater than the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the difference between the Initial Closing Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital, and Seller shall pay such amount to Purchaser. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_ shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.

 (b) Benefits. 

    

 (i) At the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Continuing Employees, who remain employed with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, with compensation (including salary, wages and opportunities for commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime and premium pay), employee benefits, location of employment and a position of employment that are, in each case, substantially equivalent to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. This Section _7.10(b)(i)_ shall not restrict Purchaser or any Affiliate from terminating any Continuing Employee or modifying any Continuing Employeeยs compensation (including salary, wages and opportunities for commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime and premium pay), employee benefits, location of employment or position of employment at any time after the Closing. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans or pension plans (not including vacation and sick leave which shall continue post-Closing) of Purchaser providing benefits to Continuing Employees (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), Purchaser shall credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Companies, the Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent coverage is not so denied under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and shall credit such Continuing Employees in the year of initial participation in Purchaser Plans for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans to the extent that the deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans is made available to Purchaser in order to enable Purchaser to comply with this provision.

 7.11 _Non-Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Companies and its Subsidiaries) not to, cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees who are or, after the Closing Date, become employees of Seller or its Affiliates to leave their employment with Seller or its Affiliates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward employees of Seller or its Affiliates or the hiring of such employees in response thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any employee of Seller or its Affiliates who presents himself or herself for employment without direct or indirect solicitation by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (b) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to cause, solicit, induce or encourage any Continuing Employees to leave their employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward Continuing Employees or the hiring of such employees in response thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any Continuing Employee who presents himself or herself for employment without direct or indirect solicitation by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller. 

   

 7.12 _Non-Competition_. 

  

 (a) Except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, during the period commencing immediately after the Closing and ending two (2) years from the Closing Date (unless only a shorter maximum period is permitted by applicable Law, in which case, during such shorter period), the Seller shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates (the Seller together with its controlled Affiliates, the " _Restricted Entities_ ") not to compete with the Business (as such business is conducted immediately prior to the Closing Date) in Puerto Rico (such business, as so conducted, a " _Competing Business_ "); 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this _Section 7.12_, any Restricted Entity may: 

    

 (i) purchase or otherwise acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock or controlling interest or otherwise any Person or business or engage in any similar merger and acquisition activity with any Person (such acquired Person, the " _Acquired Entity_ "), so long as: 

   

 (A) a Restricted Entity divests (or enters into an agreement to divest) within one year of such acquisition any portion of such business that would cause non-compliance with _Section 7.12(a)_; or 

   

 (B) such Person is a De Minimis Business;

 (c) In the event any controlled Affiliate of the Seller ceases to be a controlled Affiliate of the Seller, the provisions of this _Section 7.12_ shall no longer apply to such Person. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Exceptions set forth in either of _Section 7.12(b)_ or _(c)_ are set forth therein for the avoidance of doubt, as such exceptions cover actions not necessarily restricted by  _Section 7.12(a)_, and no inference shall be drawn that the activities described in either such _Section 7.12(b)_ or _(c)_ are in any way restricted or limited by the restrictions set forth in _Section 7.12(a)_. 

   

 (e) " _De Minimis Business_ " means: 

    

 (i) any equity investment by any Restricted Entity in any Person in which (x) the Restricted Entities collectively do not have a right to designate a majority, or such higher amount constituting a controlling number, of the members of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of such Person, (y) the Restricted Entities collectively hold not more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding voting securities or similar equity interest, or (z) the Restricted Entities collectively hold not more than five percent (5%) of any class of equity securities of a Person whose securities are publicly traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange; _provided_ , in the case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that no Restricted Entity controls the management of such Person; or 

   

 (ii) any business activity that would otherwise violate _Section 7.12(a)_ that is carried on by an Acquired Entity but only if, at the time of such acquisition, the revenues derived from that portion of the Acquired Entity (as defined below) that engages in the Competing Business constitutes less than fifteen percent (15%) of the annual gross revenues of the Acquired Entity. 

  

 In the event of a breach by the Seller or any other Restricted Entity of the terms of this  _Section 7.12_, subject to terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled, if it shall so elect, to institute legal proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction in New York to enforce the specific performance of such terms by the Seller (or other applicable Restricted Entity) and to enjoin the Seller (or such applicable Restricted Entity) from any further violation of this _Section 7.12_. 

  

 7.13 _Supplements and Amendment of the Disclosure Schedules_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall give reasonably prompt written notice to Purchaser after Seller becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any change, condition or event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would render any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement, if made on or immediately following the date of such event, untrue or inaccurate, (ii) the occurrence of any change, condition or event that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any failure of Seller, any of the Companies, any Subsidiary or any other Affiliate of Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or any event or condition that would otherwise result in the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to Purchaserยs obligations hereunder, (iv) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (v) any Legal Proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Authority (other than inspections in the Ordinary Course   ##### 

  

  

  

of Business) pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against a
party or the parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (b) Seller shall supplement the information set forth on the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter now existing or hereafter arising that, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules or that is necessary to correct any information in the Disclosure Schedules or in any representation or warranty of Seller which has been rendered inaccurate thereby promptly following discovery thereof. No such supplement shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or have any effect for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or the compliance by Seller with any covenant set forth herein or adversely affect Purchaserยs rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_. 

   

 7.14 _Intercompany Contracts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.14_ of the Disclosure Schedules, all contracts, agreements and arrangements (including any Tax sharing or allocation agreements) between and among any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, on the one hand (in effect as of immediately prior to Closing), and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be terminated in their entirety effective as of the Effective Time by the parties and shall be deemed voided, cancelled and discharged in their entirety. Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.14_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all intercompany balances between and among any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be eliminated by capital contribution, discharge or otherwise in their entirety as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries and shall timely pay all Taxes shown due on such returns (subject to Sellerยs indemnification obligation with respect to such Taxes as described in _Section 7.15(b)_ and _Section 9.2(a)_ ), provided that Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of any Tax Return to be filed by or with respect to any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins before but does not end on the Closing Date at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of filing for Sellerยs review and consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Allocation of Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser shall, unless prohibited by applicable state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or local Law, cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to close their Income Tax period on the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the Companies and the Subsidiaries to close their Income Tax period on the Closing Date, the amount of Income Taxes allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Income Taxes relating to such period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date and by means of a closing of the books and records of the Companies and the Subsidiaries on the Closing Date;  _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. Neither Seller, the Companies, the Subsidiaries nor Purchaser shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any similar provision of state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or local tax law) to ratably allocate Tax items for any year or taxable period that includes the Closing Date.

 (c) _Tax Refunds_. Any refund (including any interest with respect thereto) of Taxes of the Companies and the Subsidiaries attributable to any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined under _Section 7.15(b)_) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be the property of Seller, and if such refund is received by Purchaser, the Companies or the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such refund and pay over to Seller the amount of such refund. All other refunds of Taxes shall be for the account of Purchaser.

Seller shall have the right, at its expense to represent the interests of the Companies or the Subsidiaries and control the prosecution, defense and settlement of any Tax Proceeding relating exclusively to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent (and only to the extent) that the resolution of any such Tax Proceeding is reasonably certain to (as reasonably determined by Seller) have a material negative impact on the Companies or the Subsidiaries in any taxable period that does not end on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall keep Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of the portion of such Tax Proceeding that may so impact the Companies or the Subsidiaries and shall not settle such portion of the Tax Proceeding without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall represent, at its expense, the interests of the Companies and the Subsidiaries in any Tax Proceeding relating to any taxable period that begins before the Effective Time and ends after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall allow Seller and its counsel   ##### 

  

  

  

to participate in any such Tax Proceeding at Sellerยs sole expense; (ii)
Purchaser shall keep Seller fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of such Tax Proceeding; and (iii) if the
results of any such Tax Proceeding involve an issue that is the subject of
indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2_ or for which a refund
may be available to Seller, then Purchaser and Seller shall, subject to the
indemnification procedures set forth in _Section 9.4_ to the extent not
inconsistent with this _Section 7.15(d)_, jointly control the prosecution,
defense and settlement of any such Tax Proceeding; each party shall cooperate
with the other party at its own expense and there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Purchaser shall have sole control of any Tax Proceeding relating exclusively
to periods beginning after the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) _Exclusivity_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this  _Section 7.15_, on the one hand, and the provisions of _Article IX_, on the other, the provisions of this _Section 7.15_ shall control. 

   

 (f) _Carry Back of Losses_. Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Companies or the Subsidiaries to, carry back to any taxable period ending at or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss or other Tax attribute and further agrees that Seller has no obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to return or remit any refund or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by Purchaser of the foregoing undertaking. 

   

 (g) _280G_. With respect to each employee of the Companies or the Subsidiaries who is, or would reasonably be expected to be as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) ensure that any payments or economic benefit that would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) shall be exempt from the definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, and (ii) take all actions necessary to so exempt such payments (including, without limitation, obtaining any necessary waivers or consents from such "disqualified individuals") as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Within a reasonable period of time prior to taking such actions, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser and its counsel for review and comment a copy of any documents or agreements necessary to effect this _Section 7.15(g)_, including but not limited to, any consent form, disclosure statement or waiver. 

   

 (h) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

    

 (A) At the sole option of Purchaser, Seller shall make a joint election with Purchaser under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or local Tax law) with respect to the purchase of the stock of WAPA, LIN TV of San Juan and WNJX-TV, Inc. (the " _Elections_ "). If Purchaser exercises its option to have the Elections made pursuant to this _Section 7.15(h)_, Seller agrees to (i) provide Purchaser with any information reasonably requested by Purchaser to permit the Elections to be made and (ii) take all actions reasonably requested by Purchaser to effect and preserve timely the Elections (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other 

   ##### 

  

   

documents reasonably requested by Purchaser to effect and preserve such
Elections in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the
Treasury regulations (or any comparable provisions under state or local Tax
law)). If Purchaser exercises its option to have the Elections made pursuant
to this _Section 7.15(h)_, Seller represents that their sale of the stock of
WAPA, LIN TV of San Juan and WNJX-TV, Inc. is eligible for, and Purchaser
represents that it is qualified to make, such Elections. The Seller and
Purchaser shall, on or before the date that is one hundred and twenty (120)
days following the Closing Date, exchange completed and executed copies of
IRS Form 8023, required schedules thereto and any similar state or local Tax
forms. If any changes are required in those Tax forms as a result of
information that is available after the date the Elections are made, parties
will promptly agree on and make such changes. 

   

 (B) If Purchaser exercises its option to have the Elections made pursuant to this _Section 7.15(h)_, following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, as promptly as practical, prepare a schedule showing the allocation of the Purchase Price, liabilities and other relevant items among the assets of the Companies (which, for purposes of this _Section 7.15(h)(B)_ shall include WNJX-TX, Inc.) that are deemed to have been acquired pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or comparable provision of state or local Tax law) (the " _Price Allocation_ "). The Price Allocation shall be made in accordance with all relevant provisions of the Code (or applicable state or local Tax law). If, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Price Allocation, Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller objects to the allocation of one or more items reflected in the Price Allocation, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Seller and Purchaser fail to resolve such dispute within ten (10) Business Days, an independent third party mutually agreeable to the Seller and Purchaser shall, acting reasonably, determine the final Price Allocation. The allocation reflected in the Price Allocation shall be binding on the parties hereto, and the Seller and Purchaser agree to act (and cause their respective Affiliates to act) in accordance with the Price Allocation in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return, including IRS Form 8594 or any equivalent statement and not to take (or permit any of their Affiliates to take) any tax reporting position that is inconsistent with such Price Allocation unless otherwise required by Law. If, as a result of a change in circumstances after the Price Allocation is provided to the Seller, the Purchase Price is adjusted, then Purchaser shall notify Seller of its proposed reallocation of the Purchaser Price and the Purchaser and Seller agree to file (and cause their respective Affiliates to file) any amended Tax Returns as necessary to properly reflects such reallocation; _provided_ that if Seller disagrees with the Purchaserยs proposed reallocation in writing within ten (10) Business Days of being notified of such proposed reallocation, the same procedures that apply above with respect to the Price Allocation shall apply with respect to the proposed reallocation. 

  

 7.16 _Insurance_. For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Seller shall cause its director and officer insurance policy to be made available, at Sellerยs expense, for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Companies and Subsidiaries who on or prior to the Closing

 7.17 _Release of Indemnity Obligations_. Seller, on or prior to the Closing, shall execute and deliver to the Company, for the benefit of each of the Companies and each of the Subsidiaries, a general release and discharge, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser, releasing and discharging the Companies and each of the Subsidiaries from any and all obligations to pay or indemnify Seller or its Affiliates, guarantee or secure its or their obligations or otherwise hold it or them harmless pursuant to any agreement or other arrangement entered into prior to the Closing. 

  

 7.18 _Resignations_. Seller will deliver at the Closing the resignation of all of the directors of each of the Companies and each of the Subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing, except for such directors that Purchaser specifies in writing to Seller prior to the Closing Date.

Seller shall cause the Company to forward all invoices for Transaction Expenses to the Seller and, on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall have made payment or reimbursed the Company for each Transaction Expense, other than the fees and expenses that are estimated for services to be performed after the Closing Date or for services performed prior to the Closing Date for which the Company has not yet been billed, all of which fees and expenses shall be paid by Seller as they are later incurred or billed. Seller hereby indemnifies Purchaser and the Companies and the Subsidiaries for all Transaction Expenses.

Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct or attempt to control, supervise or direct, the operations of the Stations; those operations, including complete control and supervision of all of the Stationsย employees and policies shall be the sole responsibility of Seller, but Purchaser shall be entitled to reasonable inspection of the Stations and assets (upon reasonable prior notice and approval of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) during normal business hours with the purpose that an uninterrupted and efficient transfer of the businesses of the Companies and the Subsidiaries may be accomplished. After the Closing, Seller shall have no right to control the Stations and Seller shall have no reversionary rights in the Stations. 

  

 7.21 _Damage or Destruction_. If any damage or destruction of any of the assets of the Companies or the Subsidiaries occurs at any time after the date hereof but prior to Closing (i) Seller does not replace or restore such assets before the Effective Time, and (ii) the Closing occurs, then (1) Seller shall pay any deductibles due under applicable insurance policies and assign, convey and deliver to Purchaser all insurance proceeds received and all of Sellerยs right, title and interest to proceeds (including the right to prosecute any claims) receivable by Seller in connection with such damages, destruction or other event (net of any retrospective premium, payback or similar obligations in applicable insurance policies), and (2) Purchaser shall not be entitled to any other compensation, including any payment pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, with respect to the assets so damaged or destroyed. If any damage or destruction of any of the assets of the Companies or the Subsidiaries occurred at any time prior to the date hereof but Seller has not replaced or restored such assets before the Effective Time and insurance proceeds due with respect to such damage or destruction remain unpaid to the Companies and the Subsidiaries at

ARTICLE IX 

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until two (2) years after the Closing Date, except that (a) the representations and warranties in _Sections 5.1_,  _5.2_ , _5.4(a)_ , _5.6_ , _5.20_ , _6.1_ , _6.2_ , _6.5_ and  _6.6_ shall survive indefinitely; (b) the representations and warranties in _Section 5.9_ shall survive the Closing until the close of business on the 120th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof); and (c) the representations and warranties in _Section 5.18_ relating to environmental matters shall survive until five (5) years following the Closing Date.

 9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Sections _9.1_ and _9.5_ hereof and to the last sentence of this  _Section 9.2(a)_, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, agents, attorneys, representatives and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any Losses incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties based upon or arising directly from (i) any breach of the representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement except for _Section 5.9_ and so much of _Section 5.15(c)_ as it relates to withholding Taxes, (ii) any breach of the covenants or agreements made by Seller in this Agreement, (iii) any Taxes imposed on the Companies or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period or portion thereof (determined in accordance with  _Section 7.15(b)_) ending on or before the Closing Date, except to the extent reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, (iv) Taxes, if any, imposed on the Companies or the Subsidiaries by reason of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any similar provision of state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or local Law) by reason of being a member of an Affiliated Group on or before the Closing Date, (v) liabilities for the payment of any amounts as a result of an express or implied obligation to indemnify any other Person with respect to the payment of Taxes and (vi) those litigation matters listed on _Schedule 5.16_ of the Disclosure Schedules as of the Closing Date (as the same is required to be updated pursuant to _Section 7.13_). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any indemnity for Tax matters is limited solely to Losses relating to Taxes due and payable for any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, except for Damages arising out of or otherwise related to the breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections_   _5.9(d)_ , _5.9(e)_ , and _5.9(h)_ and any such indemnification with respect to such breaches of representations and warranties shall be subject to the limitations in Section 9.5(b). 

   

 (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such Loss relates to action taken by Purchaser or any other Person (other than Seller in breach of this Agreement) after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to   ##### 

  

  

  

mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to
the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to the
Loss. 

   

 9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Sections 9.1_ and _9.5_ , Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, agents, attorneys, representatives and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of, based upon, arising out of or relating to (a) any breach of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement, (b) any breach of the covenants or agreements made by Purchaser in this Agreement and (c) except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.2(a)_, all Liabilities of any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries arising on, before or after the Closing Date, including any Taxes imposed on any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Seller shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to the Loss. 

   

 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person against an indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnified party shall promptly provide written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim with such information with respect thereto as the indemnifying party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the indemnifying party from any of its obligations under this  _Article IX_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) If the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party against any and all Losses that may result from a Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within thirty (30) days of the indemnifying partyยs receipt of notice and requested information from the indemnified party pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim by the indemnified party during which the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party does not expressly assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party assumes the   ##### 

  

  

  

defense of any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate,
at its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate, or (ii) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party that would make such separate representation advisable; and provided,
further, that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall, at the indemnifying
partyยs expense, cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense and
make available to the indemnifying party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the indemnified partyยs possession or
under the indemnified partyยs control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the indemnified party from
all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the indemnified party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the indemnified party will be indemnified
hereunder. If a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant and does not include any of the matters listed
in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, and the
indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the
indemnifying partyยs willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject
to the applicable limitations of _Section 9.5_, pay the amount called for by
such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any
participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party
has an obligation to pay hereunder, subject to the applicable limitations of 
_Section 9.5_, shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the
settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus the
Losses of the indemnified party relating to such Third Party Claim through
the date of its rejection of the settlement offer, or (B) the
aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party
Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim,
the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party
Claim. 

   

 (c) The indemnification required hereunder in respect of a Third Party Claim shall be made by prompt payment by the indemnifying party of the amount of actual Losses in connection therewith, as and when bills are received by the indemnifying party or Losses incurred have been notified to the indemnifying party, together with interest on any amount not repaid as necessary to the indemnified party by the indemnifying party within five (5) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Losses, from the date such Losses have been notified to the indemnifying party, at the rate of interest described in _Section 3.4(f)_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) The indemnifying party shall not be entitled to require that any action be made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is made against it hereunder by the indemnified party. 

   

 (e) In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim with such information with respect thereto as the indemnifying party may reasonably request with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the indemnifying party from any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the indemnified party or otherwise than pursuant to this _Article IX_. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its Liability to the indemnified party hereunder, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the indemnifying party hereunder and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand. If the indemnifying party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the indemnified party, without prejudice to or waiver of the indemnified partyยs claim for the difference. 

   

 9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert an Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to representations and warranties of Seller only to the extent such Purchaser Indemnified Party gives notice of the Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in _Section 9.1_ for such representation and warranty. A Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert an Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _(iv)_ or _(v)_ , as the case may be, only to the extent such Purchaser Indemnified Party gives notice of the Indemnification Claim in accordance with _Section 9.4(a)_ prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the matters indemnified under _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _(iv)_ or _(v)_. Any Indemnification Claim not made in accordance with _Section 9.4(a)_ by Purchaser Indemnified Parties on or prior to the applicable date set forth in _Section 9.1_ or herein, and Sellerยs indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived by Purchaser Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article IX_, Seller shall not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $1,300,000, and then only to the extent of such excess. In no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses to be paid by Seller under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceed 50% of the Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this _Article IX_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by the indemnified   ##### 

  

  

  

party under insurance policies or otherwise, and net of any Tax benefit or
detriment actually realized by the indemnified party with respect to such
Losses. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto), neither Seller nor any other Person is making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Seller, the Companies, the Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Seller disclaims any representations or warranties, whether made by Seller, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives. Any claims a Purchaser Indemnified Party may have for breach of representation or warranty shall be based solely on the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article V_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto as supplemented or amended). In furtherance of the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto), Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and agrees that none of the Companies, Seller, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to a Purchaser Indemnified Party or any other Person for, and Seller hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility for, any representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of the Companies relating to any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries or other publications or data room information provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives, or any other document or information in any form provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives in connection with the sale of the Shares and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any opinion, information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives by any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the Companies or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates) or for Purchaserยs use of any such information. 

   

 9.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, local and foreign Income Tax purposes. 

  

 9.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person, either in contract or in tort, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages of such other Person, including loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof, whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other party in advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other party (provided that such limitation shall not limit Sellerยs right to recover contract damages in connection with Purchaserยs failure to consummate the Closing in violation of this Agreement). The exclusion of consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages as set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to any such damages sought by third parties against a Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in
connection with Losses that may be indemnified pursuant to this _Article
IX_. 

  

 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any covenant or agreement under this Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance with this _Article IX_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against the Seller Indemnified Parties or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise).

of steps to enforce such right or power or any course of conduct, by such
party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy.
