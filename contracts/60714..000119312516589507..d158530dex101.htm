(iii) the amount of CCG Entities Indebtedness, LSB Receivables and LSB

Closing, and, in such case, the Purchaser shall have the Sellers objection
rights under _Section 2.3(f)_. If neither the Purchaser nor the Seller

agreed to by the Seller in the form in which it was delivered, and shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any written notice of a dispute
regarding the Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
elements and amounts with which the Seller disagrees (a " _Notice of Dispute_

amounts contained in the Closing Statement not specifically disputed. During
the forty-five (45) day period following the delivery of a Notice of Dispute,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall make reasonable good faith efforts to
attempt to resolve such dispute and agree in writing upon the final content of
the disputed Closing Statement or to stipulate to such portion thereof with

Experts; _provided_ that the Purchaser and the Seller shall use commercially

made in accordance with this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent

records relating to the unresolved disputed items as the Accounting Experts

25  provided) to the Accounting Experts all information and records, and to make
available at any proceeding all personnel, as are reasonably necessary to
permit the Accounting Experts to resolve any disputes pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(g)_. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller may submit information
or make presentations to the Accounting Experts relating to the item or items
in dispute so long as a copy of any such submission is provided
simultaneously to the other party and so long as both parties are allowed to
be present during any such presentation. The decision of the Accounting
Experts shall be final and binding on all parties and the Closing Statement as
determined by the Accounting Experts (including the final amounts of Cash,

(ii) If the Transaction Price, as finally determined as provided in _Section

Price. If the Purchaser fails to pay such excess by such date, on and after

such excess from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, and the Indemnification

pay to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount
of any such additional excess within six (6) Business Days after the final
determination of the Transaction Price to the account specified in _Section
2.2_ (or to such other account as the Seller may indicate by written notice
to the Purchaser delivered at least two (2) Business Days in advance).

 



26 (iii) If the Transaction Price, as finally determined as provided in _Section
2.3(d)_ or _Section 2.3(g)_, as applicable, is equal to the Transaction

withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having

Entity and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the applicable CCG Entity and, to the extent necessary,
any Affiliate of such CCG Entity. No vote of, or consent by, the holders of

or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as a transferee or
successor, pursuant to a Tax Agreement or otherwise). No CCG Entity has
received or applied for a Tax ruling or entered into a closing agreement
pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any predecessor provision or any
similar provision of state or local Law), in either case that would be binding
upon a CCG Entity after the Closing Date.

 



32 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including any
provision set forth in  _Section 4.10_), no CCG Entity makes any
representation or warranty with respect to the existence, availability,

net operating loss carryforward, capital loss, capital loss carryforward,
basis amount or other Tax attribute (whether federal, state, local or foreign)

exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, as a result of any (i) change

Date under Section 481 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign income Tax law), (ii) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) any election

or "series of related transactions" in conjunction with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. No CCG Entity is a party to a "gain
recognition agreement" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under
Section 367 of the Code. No withholding of Taxes is required in connection
with the payment of the Transaction Price.

benefit plans, programs or arrangements, that are maintained, contributed to

Employee participates immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of any
Employee, but not to include the Retention Awards, which are specifically
excluded herefrom, and (ii) material employment, retention, termination,
change in control, severance or other similar contracts or agreements pursuant
to which any CCG Entity has any material obligation with respect to any
Employee, as applicable (the plans, programs, arrangements, contracts and
agreements described in clauses (i) and (ii) above are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Employee Plans_ "). Accurate and complete copies of all plan
documents, summary plan descriptions, the most recent applicable Internal
Revenue Service determination letter and the most recently filed IRS Form 5500

terms and with the requirements prescribed by ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Laws. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.11(b) of the Company

to the form of each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified and tax-
exempt under the provisions of Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code
and such Employee Plans have not been amended thereafter in any way that

Company, no fact or circumstance exists that would materially and adversely
affect the qualification or tax-exempt status of an Employee Plan that is
intended to be tax-exempt.

(d) No act, omission or transaction has occurred which would result in
imposition on any CCG Entity of (i) breach of fiduciary duty liability damages
under Section 409 of ERISA, (ii) a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
subsections (c), (i) or (l) of Section 502 of ERISA or, with respect to any
Employee Plan, Section 6652 of the Code or (iii) a material tax imposed
pursuant to Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code. No CCG Entity nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates have been involved in any transaction that could
cause any CCG Entity to be subject to liability under section 4069 of ERISA.

any liability under Title IV of ERISA and there are no facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such liability.

 

(f) There are no actions, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims
for benefits) or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, or
with respect to, any of the Employee Plans or their assets and there is no
matter pending (other than routine qualification determination filings) with

sponsored, participated in, or had any obligation to (or has any other
liability with respect to) any "multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

 

(i) All Employee Plans that are non-qualified deferred compensation programs
are in compliance or have been amended to comply with Section 409A of the
Code and have been administered in material compliance with Code Section 409A

from the Code Section 409A requirements. 

(j) The CCG Entities have not provided, and the CCG Entities have no
obligation to provide, any medical, life or similar benefits to current or

to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. No consent, approval or authorization
of, or declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person which has not been received or made, is required to be
obtained by the Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party by
the Purchaser or the consummation by the Purchaser of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (a) such filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and other
applicable requirements of, the HSR Act; and (b) any other consents,
approvals, authorizations, filings or notices which, if not made or obtained,
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 5.4 _Funds_. The Purchaser has, and at all times until the time of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have,
cash on hand, or access through existing credit facilities of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to cash, in an aggregate amount sufficient to enable the

this Agreement and to otherwise perform its obligations hereunder, including
to pay in full (a) the Transaction Price, and (b) all fees and expenses
payable by the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.5 _Independent Review; No Reliance_. The Purchaser has conducted its
own independent review and analysis of the Company, and its condition, cash
flow and prospects, including being permitted access to properties and
premises of the CCG Entities. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser
has relied exclusively upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties contained herein, and the Purchaser:

 



46 (a) acknowledges and agrees that (i) neither the Company nor the Seller nor
any Person on behalf of the Company or the Seller is making any
representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the Purchaser has not been
induced by, or relied upon any representations, warranties or statements
(written or oral), whether express or implied, made by any Person, that are
not expressly set forth in  _Article III_ or in _Article IV_ or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; and

(b) agrees, to the full extent permitted by Law, that (except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct) no director, officer, employee, Affiliate (other
than the Seller and the CCG Entities), agent or representative of the Company
or the Seller shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the
Purchaser on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state
securities laws, or otherwise) based upon any information provided or omitted,
or based on statements or omissions beyond the representations and warranties
expressly given in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges
that no representations or warranties have been made with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information that may
have been made available to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives, beyond those expressly given in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Assuming the representations and warranties of the CCG
Entities contained in this Agreement are accurate in all material respects,
at and immediately after the Closing, each of the CCG Entities and the
Purchaser (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of their respective
assets will not be less than the sum of their respective debts and that the
present fair saleable value of their respective assets will not be less than
the amount required to pay their respective liabilities as they become
absolute and matured), (b) will have adequate capital with which to engage in
their respective businesses and (c) will not have incurred, and does not
immediately plan to incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
absolute and mature.

 

Section 5.7 _Purchase for Investment_.

 

(a) The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely for investment for its own
account and not with the view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any "distribution" (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities
Act) thereof. The Purchaser understands that the sale of the Shares has not
been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities
laws by reason of specified exemptions therefrom that depend upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of its investment intent as expressed herein and
as explicitly acknowledged hereby and that under such laws and
applicable regulations such securities may not be resold without registration
under the Securities Act or under applicable state or foreign law unless an
applicable exemption from registration is available.

 

(b) The Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Purchaser, by
reason of its business and financial experience in business, has such
knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters as
to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the purchase of the
Shares, is able to bear the economic risk of such investment in the Company,
and is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.

Representatives of the Purchaser access to such offices, properties,
books and records of the CCG Entities relating to the CCG Entities and such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the CCG
Entities as such Authorized Representatives may reasonably request, and shall
allow such Authorized Representatives to make copies of, such information and
documentation (including Contracts, books and records of the CCG Entities), as
the Purchaser may reasonably request with respect to any CCG Entity for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of the representations and warranties made

into the Purchasers business operations, and shall instruct the employees,
counsel and financial advisors of Seller and Sellers Affiliates to cooperate
with the Purchaser in its investigation of the CCG Entities; _provided_ that
such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the CCG Entities;

reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secret or violate any applicable Laws (including antitrust laws of the United
States) or any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality, or (ii) to
disclose any privileged information of the Company in a manner that is
reasonably expected to result in the loss of such privilege, or (iii) to

restrict the Purchaser or its Affiliates from contacting any suppliers,
Employees, independent contractors, sales representatives or customers of any
CCG Entity on its own in the ordinary course of the Purchasers or its

of the Seller (or to cause the Seller to enforce its rights) under

the solicitation of employees, sales representatives and other agents of any
Entity, and the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser copies of any such
agreements.

confidentiality, non-solicitation or similar agreement entered into by LSB or
any of its Affiliates (i) in connection with a proposed sale of the Business

consent of Purchaser. Following the Closing, at the sole expense
of Purchaser, LSB, Seller and any of their respective Affiliates with rights
to enforce a Non-Disclosure Agreement will do so at the request and under the
direction of Purchaser through legal counsel selected by Purchaser.

any litigation as contemplated by this _Section 6.4(b)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not require

Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, no CCG Entity shall
amend its organizational documents in any manner so as to modify the
indemnification or exculpation provisions therein in such a manner
inconsistent with this _Section 6.6(b)_ or otherwise adverse to a DandO

this _Section 6.6(c)_ and (ii) in addition to, and not in

 



54  substitution for, any other rights to indemnification that any such DandO
Indemnitee may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Purchaser
and the Company under this  _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any DandO
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.6(c)_ applies unless (x) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected DandO
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification.

(d) Following the Closing and to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the
Purchaser agrees not to, and to cause its affiliates not to, bring any action

respective capacities as director, manager or officer of a CCG Entity prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
6.6(d)_ shall preclude the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof (including any
CCG Entity) from bringing an action against a DandO Indemnitee in relation to
any act(s) or omission(s) of such DandO Indemnitee that (i) was committed in bad
faith or was the result of Fraud, or (ii) as a result of or in connection with
which such DandO Indemnitee gained or received, directly or indirectly, any
financial profit or other advantage to which such DandO Indemnitee obtained as a
result of Fraud or criminal acts.

 

(e) In the event that the Purchaser, a CCG Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser and the applicable CCG Entity shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 6.6(e)_.

this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
parties, issue such press release or make such public statement (x) if it is
required to do so by law, regulation or the rules of any regulatory authority
(including any recognized stock exchange) or (y) in the case it is compelled
to do so in connection with legal proceedings or pursuant to a subpoena,
order, requirement or an official request issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by any administrative, legislative, regulatory or self-
regulating authority (including any recognized stock exchange) or entity
towards such party, and (to the extent reasonably practicable having regard

which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made plus any other relevant tax
items) among the CCG Entities and for the deemed sale of assets resulting
from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, setting forth the estimated fair market
values of the assets of each of the CCG Entities with respect to which a
Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made. The Purchaser shall prepare draft
Forms 8883 (Asset Allocation Statement under Section 338) (or successor forms)
with respect to each such CCG Entity and provide such draft Forms 8883 to the
Seller no later than ninety (90) days prior to the due date of such Forms
8883. If, within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the draft Forms 8883,
the Seller notifies the Purchaser in writing that the Seller disagrees with a
draft Form 8883, then the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
their disagreement within the forty-five (45) days following the Sellers
notification to the Purchaser of such disagreement. If the Seller does not so
notify the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a draft Form
8883, or upon resolution of the disputed items by the parties, the draft Form
8883 shall become a "Final Form 8883." If the parties are unable to resolve
their disagreement within the forty-five (45) days following any
such notification by the Seller, then the parties shall submit all such
disputed items for resolution to the Accounting Experts whose decision shall
be final and binding upon the parties and whose fees and expenses shall be
borne equally by the parties. Any Form 8883 delivered by the Accounting
Experts shall be a Final Form 8883. The parties shall act in good faith to
cause the Accounting Experts to deliver a Final Form 8883 within twenty (20)
days after such submission. The parties shall (i) be bound by all Final Forms
8883 for purposes of determining any Taxes and prepare and file their Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with the Final Forms 8883, unless otherwise
required because of a change in applicable Tax Law. No later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the date such Forms 8883 and any related documentation are
required to be filed under the applicable Laws, LSB shall execute and deliver
to the Purchaser a Final Form 8883 with respect to each of the CCG
Entities (other than IEC and Koax). With respect to any amounts paid by the
Purchaser after the Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchaser agree that such
amounts shall be characterized as goodwill. LSB, on behalf of the Seller, and
the Purchaser agree to file a Supplemental Form 8883 on a timely manner, as
specified in the instructions to Form 8883.

(iii) Each of the Purchaser, LSB and the Seller agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to modify or revoke the Section
338(h)(10) Elections or any form filed in connection therewith, or any such
available election under any substantially similar state or local Law if
requested by the other, without the written consent of such other.

(iv) The Purchaser, LSB and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
information contained in all Final Forms 8883 (including any Supplemental Form
8883) or any form filed in connection therewith, unless otherwise
required because of a change in applicable tax Law.

 



56 (b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, LSB shall in a
timely manner prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Seller Consolidated Returns and pay all Consolidated Taxes. All such Tax
Returns to the extent related to the CCG Entities shall be filed consistent
with most recent past practice unless failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to cause any adverse effect (other than a de minimis one) on any CCG
Entity or the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties intend that
any federal income Tax deductions incurred by the Company on the Closing Date
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
payment of CCG Entities Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses) shall be
treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(ii) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns (other
than Seller Consolidated Returns) of the CCG Entities for all tax periods
that end on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") and for
all Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Tax Returns_ "). Straddle Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with most recent past practice except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. For each Pre-Closing Tax
Return or Straddle Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date, no
later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (including any applicable
extensions) thereof, the Seller shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return,
together with all supporting documentation and work papers, to Purchaser for
its reasonable review and comment. The Seller shall provide the Purchaser with
such Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Tax Return, as applicable, (fully
prepared and completed by the Seller, and revised by the Seller to incorporate
the Purchasers reasonable comments) and the Purchaser shall cause such Tax
Return to be executed and timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Entity and provide a copy of such executed and filed Tax Return to the Seller.

 

(iii) If the Purchaser objects to any item on a Tax Return prepared by the
Seller pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)(ii)_, the Purchaser shall, within fifteen
days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify the Seller in writing that it
so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the
specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice
of objection is duly delivered, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. In
the event of any disagreement that cannot be resolved between Purchaser and
Seller, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of national
or international reputation mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Tax Accountant_ "), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be
final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller. If the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences
between Seller and Purchaser with respect to such Tax Return at least five
days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by the Seller and amended to reflect the Tax Accountants resolution.
The preparation and filing of any Tax Return that does not relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control
of the Purchaser.

 



57 (iv) In the case of Taxes (other than Consolidated Taxes) that are payable
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(A) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the applicable
CCG Entity ended with (and included) the Closing Date; _provided_ that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period; and

 

(B) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the applicable CCG Entity, deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period.

 

(v) Unless otherwise required by Law, after the Closing, LSB and the Seller
shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to, amend any Tax
Returns or change any Tax elections or accounting methods with respect to any
CCG Entity relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such amendment
or change would reasonably be expected to have a material cost to the
Purchaser or any CCG Entity without the consent of the Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(vi) Unless otherwise required by Law, the Purchaser shall not amend any Pre-
Closing Tax Returns or Straddle Tax Returns without the prior written consent
of the Seller to the extent such amendment would reasonably be expected to
have a material cost to the Seller.

(c) _Books and Records; Cooperation_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any audit, litigation,
examination or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") and claim for
refund, the determination of a Tax liability or a right to refund with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of any CCG Entity. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, Tax Proceeding, Tax
refund or Tax determination and making Employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, the control and
conduct of any Tax Proceeding that is a Third Party Claim shall be governed by
_Section 10.6_.

 

(d) _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding _Section 10.6_, any Tax Proceeding
relating to a Seller Consolidated Return or Consolidated Taxes shall be
exclusively controlled by Seller. Any other Tax Proceeding constituting a
Third Party Claim shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 10.6_.

 



58 (e) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for all state and
local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes and shall cooperate and timely make all filings, returns,
reports, and forms with respect to such Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall execute and deliver to each other at the Closing any appropriate
exemption certificate relating to any available exemption from Transfer Taxes.

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of any CCG Entity for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ (other than to the
extent such refund results from the carryback of a Tax attribute of any CCG
Entity relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period and other than any such refunds
reflected on the Closing Statement as finally determined) shall be for the
account of the Seller to the extent provided in this _Section 6.8(f)_. All
other refunds of Taxes of any CCG Entity shall be for the account of the
Purchaser. The amount of any refund of Taxes of any CCG Entity for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Purchaser and the
Seller in accordance with the principles set forth in  _Section 6.8(b)(iv)_.
Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
party entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this _Section 6.8(f)_
the amount of such refund within thirty (30) days after such refund is
received, net of any costs or expenses or any Taxes incurred by such party or
its Affiliates in procuring such refund. The Purchaser shall make and shall
cause the CCG Entities to make elections under Section 172(b)(3) and other
relevant provisions of the Code, and under any comparable provision of any
state, local or foreign tax law in any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction
in which the CCG Entities are included in a Seller Consolidated Return, to
relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to any net operating
loss, capital loss, or tax credit of the CCG Entities in any Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date that could be carried back to a Pre-Closing
period of the CCG Entities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
any such item for which an election cannot be made under applicable Law, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive (and the Seller shall be required to
pay to the Seller) the Tax refund received or Tax benefit that results from
such carryback.

(g) _Tax Agreements; Powers of Attorney_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall terminate all Tax Agreements to which any CCG Entity is a party such
that no CCG Entity shall have no obligations thereunder following the Closing.

 

(h) _Consolidated Return Elections_. Seller shall cause the Seller
Consolidated Group to make (or refrain from making, as applicable)
Tax elections (including on a protective basis) so that the CCG Entities
shall suffer no reduction in tax basis or other attributes pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36.

 

Section 6.9 Resignation _of Officers, Managers and Directors_. Unless directed
otherwise by the Purchaser in writing, the Company and the Seller shall cause
all officers and directors of the CCG Entities to deliver their written
resignations to the Purchaser or to otherwise by removed from office to be
effective on or before the Closing.

 



59 Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Purchaser of: (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event of which it has Knowledge that causes or would be reasonably
likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or the Seller
contained in this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material respect at any
time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time and (b) the failure of the
Company or the Seller to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant to be complied with by such party hereunder (a " _Disclosure Letter
Update_ "). No Disclosure Letter Update shall have any effect for the purposes
of indemnification hereunder or, except as provided below, relieve the Seller
or the Company from any breach or violation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless the Purchaser provides
the Company with a written termination notice pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_ within seven (7) Business Days after the expiration of any
applicable cure period, if any, in respect of a breach described in a
Disclosure Letter Update delivered pursuant to this  _Section 6.10_ and
which uncured breach would otherwise give rise to a termination right by the
Purchaser under _Section 9.1(d)(i)_, then the Purchaser, in respect of such
uncured breach, shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this
Agreement or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 7.3_ and such breach
shall not be deemed to be a breach that would prevent the Company or the
Seller from delivering the certificate referenced in _Section 8.2(b)_ or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_.

 

Section 6.11 _Third-Party (Non-Governmental Entity) Consents_.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall give any notices to third parties (who are not
Governmental Entities) and use, and cause their Subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts (including cooperating to the fullest extent
reasonably practicable with the efforts of the other parties) to obtain any
consents and approvals from such third parties triggered in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (regardless of
whether such consents are conditions to the closing of this Agreement);
_provided_ that the Seller shall be required to pay a fee to obtain a Persons
consent (if required in order to obtain such consent) only with respect to
Contracts listed in _Section 7.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter_;
_provided_ _further_ (subject to the foregoing proviso) that the Seller shall
not be required to pay a fee to a Person in order to obtain such Persons
consent or to amend any existing Contract with such Person or to enter into
any new Contract with such Person in order to obtain such Persons consent.

 

(b) With respect to any Material Contract for which any consent necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby has
not been obtained prior to the Closing, in the event that the Closing occurs,
(i) the Seller shall, at the Purchasers request, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such consent after the Closing until either
such consent has been obtained or the Seller and the Purchaser mutually
agree, in good faith, that such consent cannot reasonably be obtained and (ii)
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser
with the same benefits arising under any such Material Contract that is an
Assigned Contract, including performance by the Seller as agent if legally and
commercially feasible, _provided_ that the Purchaser shall provide the Seller
with such access to the premises, books and records and personnel of
Purchaser and the Company as is reasonably necessary to enable the Seller to
perform its obligations under such Assigned Contract, and the Purchaser shall
pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such
benefits to the extent the Company would have been responsible therefor if
such consent had been obtained prior to the Closing.

 



60 Section 6.12 [Reserved]

 

Section 6.13 _Existing Letters of Credit_. The Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the CCG Entities) to be released in full from any letters of credit,
surety bonds, guarantees and other contractual obligations of the Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the CCG Entities) set forth on _Section 6.13 of
the Company Disclosure Letter_, effective as of the Closing. The Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to, cooperate with and
to provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser as may be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in connection with the actions contemplated by
this _Section 6.13_.

Section 6.14 _Other Agreements_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall, on the one hand, and, as applicable, the Seller shall, or shall cause
one or more of its Affiliates to, on the other hand, enter into the following
agreements (together, the " _Ancillary Agreements_ ").

(a) a Transition Services Agreement in a form and substance attached as
_Exhibit A_ to this Agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "), and

(b) two leases, in the form and substance as may be further negotiated by
the parties in good faith based on drafts exchanged prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Leases_ ") for the lease of the premises occupied by certain
CCG Entities at 15 S. Virginia Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and 518 N.
Indiana Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Section 6.15 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall take such action as may be necessary so that on and
after the Closing and at all times prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Covered Employees (as defined below) shall, for so long as
their employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates continues during
such period, be provided employee benefits, plans and programs (including
deferred compensation, pension, life insurance, welfare, profit sharing,
severance, salary continuation and fringe benefits, but excluding 401(k),
incentive compensation arrangements and retention awards) which, in the
aggregate, are (i) not materially less favorable than those currently
provided to Covered Employees by the Seller immediately prior to the Closing
or (ii) are substantially the same as those made available by the Purchaser to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. Any costs (including without
limitation vendor and broker costs) associated with replicating current
employee benefits, plans and programs for this purpose that are incurred prior
to the Closing shall be borne by the Seller. For all purposes of
this Agreement, " _Covered Employees_ " shall mean all Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date other than the Identified Employees. For purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits provided by the
Purchaser or the CCG Entities on and after the Closing, the Covered Employees
will be credited with their years of service with the CCG Entities and prior
employers to the extent service with the CCG Entities and prior employers is
taken into account under the Employee Plans. The eligibility of Covered
Employees to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of the
Purchaser and the CCG Entities on and after the Closing shall not be subject
to any eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or
any exclusions or

 



61  limitations for any pre-existing conditions except to the extent such
individual was or would have been subject to such exclusion under similar
Employee Plans. The Purchaser shall cause each Covered Employee to be given
credit under any welfare benefit plan or program of the Purchaser or the CCG
Entities for all amounts paid by such Covered Employee under any benefit plans
or programs offered by the CCG Entities or any Affiliate of the CCG Entities
prior to the Closing for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable plan or program maintained by the Purchaser for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs. At the Purchasers request, the Seller
will cause the CCG Entities to provide the Purchaser with information
reasonably necessary (including employment records and payroll records) to
permit the Purchaser to give effect to and to comply with this _Section
6.15(a)_, subject to applicable Law.

 

(b) For a period of ninety-one (91) days (inclusive) following the Closing
Date, the Purchaser and the CCG Entities shall not implement any plant
closing, mass layoff or other termination of employees that, either alone or
in the aggregate (with any other termination of employees by the CCG Entities
prior to the Closing Date), would create any obligations upon or liabilities
for Seller or its Affiliates under the WARN Act. Following the Closing Date,
the Purchaser and the Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries hereby
agree to indemnify the Seller and its officers, directors, employees,
consultants, stockholders and Affiliates for, and to hold each of them
harmless from and against, all Damages (which shall not include, for avoidance
of doubt, Seller Severance Costs) that any of them may suffer by reason of or
in connection with any claim, proceeding or suit brought against any of them
under the WARN Act, or other Law relating to Employment, which relate to
actions taken by the Purchaser or the CCG Entities or any of their respective
Affiliates at any time after the Closing (including any discharge or
constructive discharge of any of the employees of the CCG Entities with regard
to any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within
any site of employment of the CCG Entities) or to the Purchasers pre-
Closing identification of any Identified Employee.

(c) The Seller shall bear and be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations under any written retention bonus, transaction bonus or similar
arrangement of the CCG Entities, the Seller, LSB or any of their respective
Affiliates entered into prior to the Closing applicable to any Employee
whereby payment is triggered by the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, the Retention Awards, and shall ensure that
such bonuses are paid in accordance with their terms in effect as of the
Closing Date.

 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Covered Employee shall cease active
participation in and benefit accrual under, and each CCG Entity shall cease
to be a contributing sponsor of, and participating employer in, any benefit
plans, programs or arrangements, including the Seller 401k Plan, that are
sponsored or maintained by Seller or LSB. Prior to the Closing, Seller or
its Affiliates shall fully fund, through the Closing, all employee
contributions and employer matching contributions required pursuant to the
terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan with respect to Covered Employees. Effective
as soon as administratively possible following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause, or cause its Affiliates to cause, the Covered Employees to
participate in a defined contribution plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred arrangement which meets
the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Purchaser DC Plan_ ").
The terms of the Purchaser DC Plan

 



62  shall provide that Covered Employees shall have the right to make direct
rollovers to the applicable Purchaser DC Plan of their accounts in the Seller
401k Plan, including if the entire account balance is rolled over, a direct
rollover of any notes evidencing loans made to such Covered Employees with
respect to the transferred accounts.

 

(e) To the extent that such coverage constitutes Seller Severance Costs,
Seller shall provide COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning of
Section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder) to all
Identified Employees who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning
assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury regulation Section 54.4980B-9)
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the
duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such
coverage. Seller shall take any and all necessary actions to ensure that
Purchaser and its affiliates are not required to provide such continuation
coverage to the extent of Seller Severance Costs to any such individual at any
time. Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the cost to Seller of providing
COBRA continuation coverage to the Identified Employees in excess of the
limits of the Seller Severance Costs to the extent such limits are exceeded.

 

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date: (a) to the extent such balances are not
actually transferred, each Covered Employees account balance, if any, in the
health care flexible spending account and dependent care spending account
(whether positive or negative, collectively, the " _Transferred Account
Balances_ ") under the health care flexible spending and dependent care
spending plan(s) of LSB or its Affiliates (collectively, the " _LSB Flex Plan_
") shall be credited or debited for booking purposes, as applicable, to one or
more comparable plans of the Company, the Purchaser or their
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Flex Plan_ "); (b) the elections,
contribution levels and coverage levels of the Covered Employees who
participated in the LSB Flex Plan prior to Closing (the " _Covered Flex
Plan Employees_ ") shall apply under the Purchaser Flex Plan in the same
manner as under the LSB Flex Plan; and (c) the Covered Flex Plan Employees
shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser Flex Plan for claims incurred at any
time during the plan year of the Purchaser Flex Plan in which the Closing
occurs that are submitted to the Purchaser Flex Plan from or after Closing on
the same basis and the same terms and conditions as under the LSB Flex Plan.

 

(g) Except as provided in _Section 6.15(e)_, the Seller agrees that any
claims for welfare benefits incurred before the Closing Date with respect to
any Employees (or their covered dependents or beneficiaries) shall be the
responsibility of the Seller or the insurers of the Sellers welfare plans and
the Purchaser agrees that any claims for welfare benefits incurred on
or after the Closing Date with respect to any Employees (or their covered
dependents or beneficiaries) shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser or
the insurers of Purchasers welfare plans. For the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to health care services provided in connection with in-patient
hospitalization, such claim is deemed to incurred on the first day on which
hospitalization occurs. In the event of an employees death or permanent
disability, the claim for welfare benefits shall be deemed to be incurred on
the date the employee dies or is deemed permanently disabled under the
applicable plan.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.15_ are solely for the benefit of the
Company, the Seller and the Purchaser, and no current or former Employee or
any other individual shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this  _Section 6.15_. In no event shall the terms of this
_Section 6.15_ be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any

 



63  Employee Plan, any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained
or sponsored by Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
(ii) alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any CCG Entity) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, or (iii) confer upon any
current or former Employee, officer, partner, member, director or consultant,
any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including any CCG Entity), preclude the
ability of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including any CCG Entity) to
terminate the employment or services of any Employee, officer, partner,
member, director or consultant for any reason, or constitute or create an
employment agreement with any such Person.

(i) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
shall identify in writing to the Seller each Employee that Purchaser
determines will be terminated from employment with a CCG Entity effective at
the Closing (each such Employee along with any other Employees Purchaser
otherwise requests that Seller terminate, an " _Identified Employee_ ").
Seller shall take all action necessary or appropriate to cause each Identified
Employee to be terminated from employment with the applicable CCG Entity
effective at the Closing. Seller may cause the employment of any Identified
Employee to be transferred to an Affiliate of the Seller (other than a CCG
Entity). Seller shall be responsible for and shall bear all Seller
Severance Costs. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall bear all
Purchaser Severance Costs.

Section 6.16 _Seller s Access to Information_. From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the CCG Entities to) hold all the books
and records of the CCG Entities existing on the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of any such books or records for a period of five (5)
years from the Closing, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose of
such books and records, to offer first in writing at least ninety (90) days
prior to such destruction or disposal to surrender them to the Seller. During
that five year period, the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the CCG Entities
to), during normal business hours, and upon reasonable notice, make available
and provide the Seller and its representatives (including counsel
and independent auditors) with access to the facilities and properties of the
CCG Entities and to all information, files, documents and records (written and
computer) that are not otherwise protected by legal privilege relating to the
CCG Entities or any of their businesses or operations for any and all periods
prior to or including the Closing Date that they may reasonably require with
respect to any reasonable business purpose (including any Tax matter) or in
connection with any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, investigation or
proceeding of any kind by or against any person, and shall (and shall cause
the CCG Entities to) cooperate fully with the Seller and its representatives
(including counsel and independent auditors) in connection with the
foregoing, at the sole cost and expense of the Seller, including by making
tax, accounting and financial personnel and other appropriate employees and
officers of the CCG Entities reasonably available to the Seller and
its respective representatives (including counsel and independent auditors),
with regard to any reasonable business purpose.

 



64 Section 6.17 _Insurance_.

 

(a) The Seller shall cause to be maintained through the Closing the Policies
(or other policies providing substantially similar insurance coverage). Prior
to Closing, the Seller shall purchase "tail" insurance policies that meet the
following criteria: (1) naming the DandO Indemnitees and CCG Entities as
insureds; (2) containing a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Closing; (3) issued by the current insurers or an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the current insurers; (4) for (a) directors and
officers liability with stand alone policy limits of $20 million ($250,000
self insured retention), (b) employment practices liability with stand alone
policy limits (including entity coverage) of $10 million ($100,000 self
insured retention), (c) fiduciary with stand alone policy limits of $5
million ($0 self insured retention) and (d) lawyers professional liability
with stand alone policy limits of $1 million ($10,000 self insured retention)
coverages (or for such lesser amount of coverage as Purchaser may agree to in
its sole discretion); and (5) otherwise in a scope at least as favorable as
the existing policies or towers of policies with respect to acts, omissions,
or wrongful acts that allegedly took place at or prior to the Closing and upon
terms and coverage substantially identical to those set forth in the existing
policies. The premiums for such "tail" insurance policies shall be borne by
the Seller up to a maximum of $250,000, with any excess over such amount to be
paid directly by the Purchaser at the time such policies are bound. The

(other than the CCG Entities), including the Seller and LSB making available
to the Purchaser human resources and other data reasonably requested by the
Purchaser related to the CCG Entities and (ii) finalize _Schedule A_ to the
Transition Services Agreement setting forth the Transition Services (as
defined in the Transition Services Agreement), respectively. Each party shall
bear its own costs incurred in connection with the activities contemplated in

65 Section 6.19 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) LSB and the Seller acknowledge and agree that (A) the agreements and
covenants contained in this _Section 6.19_ (i) impose a reasonable restraint
on LSB and the Seller in light of the activities and business of the CCG
Entities on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the current plans
of the CCG Entities, (ii) are reasonable and valid in geographical and
temporal scope and in all other respects, and (iii) are essential to protect
the value of the Business and (B) they have obtained knowledge, contacts,
know-how and experience and that such knowledge, contacts, know-how
and experience could be used to the substantial advantage of a competitor of
the CCG Entities and to the detriment of the CCG Entities. LSB and the Seller
also acknowledge that the Purchaser has agreed to purchase the Shares in
reliance on the covenants made by LSB and the Seller in this _Section 6.19_,
and that the Purchaser would not have agreed to purchase the Shares in the
absence of the covenants made by LSB and the Seller in this _Section 6.19_.
Subject to  _Section 6.19(b)_, from and after the Closing and until the
third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restrictive Covenant
Period_ "), LSB and the Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, (i) engage in the Business in the United States or (ii) own
an interest in, or manage, operate, control, or participate in or be connected
with, as a director, officer, employee, partner, member, stockholder,
consultant, agent or otherwise, any Person engaged in the Business ("
_Competing Person_ "), in each case, directly or indirectly, alone or in
conjunction with any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, for purposes of this _Section 6.19_, "Affiliates" of LSB
and the Seller shall not include any Person solely based on being a
stockholder or director of LSB. Each of LSB and the Seller further agrees
that, during the Restrictive Covenant Period, it shall not, directly or
indirectly, for its own account or for the account of any other Person, engage
in Interfering Activities.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.19_ to the contrary, nothing
contained in this _Section 6.19_ shall prohibit or restrict LSB, the Seller
or any of their respective Affiliates from collectively owning up to an
aggregate of three percent (3%) of the outstanding shares of any class of
capital stock of any publicly traded Competing Person so long as none of LSB,
the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates participates in the
management of such Competing Person.

(c) Each of LSB and the Seller hereby agrees and stipulates, on behalf of
itself and each of its Affiliates, that in any action or claim brought by LSB,
the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, or in any action or claim
brought against LSB, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates,
involving the provisions of _Section 6.19(a)_, each of LSB and the Seller
hereby waives, and hereby agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any claim
or defense that the non-competition covenants provided in _Section 6.19(a)_
are unenforceable, void or voidable, for any reason, including, but not
limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, illegality, unenforceable restraint of
trade, failure of consideration, illusory contract, mistake or any other
substantive legal defense.

(d) From and after the date hereof and until the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, LSB and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and representatives (in such capacity) to keep confidential any
knowledge and information relating to any CCG Entity or any portion of the
Business which is not publicly available, including information which (i) is
in the nature of competitively sensitive information the disclosure of which
could harm the competitive advantage of any CCG Entity or its successors with
respect to the operation of the Business or provides a competitive advantage
to a competitor of any CCG Entity or its successors, or (ii) could otherwise
materially harm any CCG Entitys ownership or operation of the Business (each
of the foregoing, the " _Proprietary Information_ ") which LSB, the

 



66  Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the CCG Entities)
obtained with respect to the CCG Entities or their respective representatives
unless and to the extent (x) publicly available (other than as a result of an
act or omission of LSB, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives), (y) required by the rules of any national or international
securities exchange or other self-regulatory entity applicable to LSB, the
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives, or (z) as
requested pursuant to a subpoena, court order, civil investigative demand or
similar judicial process or other oral or written request issued by a court
of competent jurisdiction or by international, national, state or local
governmental or regulatory body.

(e) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall at any time deem the
duration or the geographic scope of any of the provisions of this _Section
6.19_ unenforceable, the other provisions of this _Section 6.19_ shall
nevertheless stand and the duration and/or geographic scope set forth herein
shall be deemed to be the longest period and/or greatest size permissible by
Law under the circumstances, and the parties hereto agree that such court
shall reduce the time period and/or geographic scope to permissible duration
or size.

(f) Without limiting the remedies available to the Purchaser, LSB and the
Seller acknowledge that a breach by LSB or the Seller of any of the covenants
contained in this _Section 6.19_ may result in material irreparable injury to
the Purchaser and the CCG Entities for which there is no adequate remedy at
Law, that it may not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the
Purchaser or any CCG Entity shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining
order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without the necessity of
proving irreparable harm or injury as a result of such breach or threatened
breach hereof, restraining LSB and/or the Seller from engaging in activities
prohibited by this _Section 6.19_ or such other relief as may be required
specifically to enforce any of the covenants in this _Section 6.19_.

(g) Each covenant in this _Section 6.19_ shall be construed as an agreement
independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any
claim or cause of action of LSB or the Seller against the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Purchaser of each such
covenant. The covenants contained in this _Section 6.19_ shall not be
affected by any breach of any other provision hereof by any party hereto.
LSB, the Seller and Purchaser intend that the covenants in this _Section
6.19_ shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each and
every county of the United States.

 

Section 6.20 _Title Insurance_. The Purchaser shall have the right to procure,
with any title premiums, other title charges and survey costs being at the
Purchasers sole cost and expense, an owners policy of title insurance (or
endorsements to any existing owners policy of title insurance issued to any
CCG Entity) for each Owned Real Property (the " _New Title Coverage_ "), and
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Purchaser in connection therewith, including by the Seller providing to Title
Insurer, at or prior to Closing, (a) one or more owners affidavits in form
and substance customary for the jurisdiction in which the applicable Owned
Real Property is located; (b) a non-imputation affidavit from the Seller in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller; (c) one or more
survey affidavits in form and substance customary for the jurisdiction in
which the applicable Owned Real Property is located; and (d) such other
information or documents as Title Insurer may reasonably request from
the Seller in connection with the Purchasers efforts to

 



67  procure the New Title Coverage (collectively, the " _Title Documents_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall (i) obtaining the New Title
Coverage be a condition to the Purchasers obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any Title Document expand the
Sellers obligations or liabilities or decrease its rights or benefits under
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.21 _Purchaser R andW Insurance_.

 

(a) Not more than five Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
Seller shall pay to the applicable Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider the
underwriting fee and premiums necessary to bind the Purchaser RandW Insurance
Policy. Prior to or in connection with the Closing, the Seller shall pay the
applicable Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider the remaining premiums necessary
for the issuance of the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy up to a maximum of
$2,500,000 (inclusive of the underwriting fee and premiums paid to bind the
policy), with any excess over such amount to be paid directly by the
Purchaser.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall execute and cause to be executed all certifications
attached to the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy or otherwise as may be
reasonably required by the Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider.

representatives shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein to the Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives. Each of the parties hereto

liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller in
the circumstances in which such Payment is due and payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Purchaser be
entitled to payment of the Payment on more than one occasion.

Closing and any Transaction Expenses, in each case, not taken into account in
connection with the calculation and payment of the Transaction Price at
Closing or after Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_.

 

For the purposes of determining under this _Section 10.2_ (i) whether any
representation made by the Company or the Seller herein is inaccurate or
whether there has been a breach of any warranty and (ii) the amount of any
Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach, such

 



74  representation and warranty (excluding each Scrape Excluded Representation)
shall be considered without regard to any qualification by or reference to the
words "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect,"
"material," "materiality," "in all material respects" or any similar words or
qualifications contained therein (other than any qualification or
reference contained in the definition of any defined term used herein).

Section 10.3 _Limitation on the Seller s Indemnification Obligations_. The
Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to the provisions of _Section
10.2_ are subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
10.2(a)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes) or the Fundamental
Representations) any Damages until the total amount which Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under _Section 10.2(a)_ (except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes) or
the Fundamental Representations) exceeds $2,730,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which point the Seller shall be liable only for the amounts in excess of
the Deductible; _provided_ that the Seller shall not be liable to indemnify
Purchaser Indemnitees for any individual claim or claims relating to the same
set of facts and circumstances pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ until
Purchaser Indemnitees have suffered aggregate Damages arising out of such
claim or claims relating to the same set of facts and circumstances equaling
or exceeding $36,000, in which case the Seller shall be liable for all Damages
arising out of such claim or claims subject to the limitations of this
_Section 10.3_; and _provided_ _further_ that all claims for which the Seller
is not required to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees because the associated
Damages do not equal or exceed $36,000 shall also not count towards the
Deductible;

(b) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover from Seller under 
_Section 10.2(a)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes) or
Fundamental Representations) any Damages to the extent the aggregate claims
under  _Section 10.2(a)_ (except for the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes) or the Fundamental Representations) of
Purchaser Indemnitees exceed $2,730,000 (the " _Liability Cap_ ").

 

(c) The aggregate liability of the Seller for Damages of Purchaser Indemnitees
under _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed the amount of the final Transaction
Price.

(d) _Indemnification Escrow Fund_. To provide a fund against which a Purchaser
Indemnitee may assert claims of indemnification under this _Article X_ (each
a " _Purchaser Indemnification Claim_ "), the Indemnification Escrow Amount
shall be deposited into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance
with  _Section 2.2(b)_. The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be held and
distributed in accordance with this _Article X_ and the Escrow Agreement.
Each Purchaser Indemnification Claim shall be made only in accordance with
this  _Article X_ and the Escrow Agreement. A Purchaser Indemnitee shall
seek monetary recourse for Purchaser Indemnification Claims solely as set
forth in _Section 10.3(h)_.

 

(e) _Reserved Amounts in the Indemnification Escrow Fund; Release in respect
of Claims_. In the event any Purchaser Indemnification Claim is made by a
Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to a Notice of Claim delivered to the Seller
prior to the Final Release Date,

 



75  the Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to determine a
reasonable amount to be reserved and held in deposit in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund in respect of such Notice of Claim (a " _Reserved Amount_ "). If
the Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement as to the Reserved
Amount by the Final Release Date, then the Reserved Amount with respect to
such Notice of Claim shall be a reasonable amount determined in good faith by
the Purchaser. Upon the agreement by the Seller and the Purchaser Indemnitee
or as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of
any Notice of Claim, any amounts payable with respect to any Damage in a
Notice of Claim to the Purchaser Indemnitee shall be payable in accordance
with _Section 10.3(h)_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall deliver executed
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Purchaser such
amount. 

(f) _Release from Escrow_.

 

(i) On the Final Release Date or promptly thereafter, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall deliver executed instructions, directing the Escrow Agent to,
subject to the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement, disburse to the Seller
the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount which exceeds any
Reserved Amounts in respect of Purchaser Indemnification Claims pending, but
not yet paid.

(ii) Following the Final Release Date, from time to time, upon resolution of
any Purchaser Indemnification Claim and the payment of amounts, if any,
determined to be payable to the Purchaser from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, the Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to release to the Seller the excess of the then-current balance in
the Indemnification Escrow Fund over the aggregate Reserved Amounts in
respect of all remaining unresolved Purchaser Indemnification Claims made
prior to the Final Release Date, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(g) _No Escrow Offsets_. Purchaser Indemnitees may not offset funds held in or
to be released from (i) the Adjustment Escrow against any claims against
Seller, LSB or any of their respective Affiliates, including Purchaser
Indemnification Claims or (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Fund against any
claims against Seller, LSB or any of their respective Affiliates,
including Purchaser claims pursuant to _Section 6.16_ or _Section 6.19_.

(h) _Sources of Recovery for Section 10.2(a) Claims; Required Recourse to
Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties agree that recovery for Purchaser Indemnification
Claims pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ shall be subject to the following
requirements:

(i) Until the Final Release Date and while funds remain in the Indemnification
Escrow Account, the Purchaser Indemnitees may seek recovery from the
Indemnification Escrow Account for Purchaser Indemnification Claims arising
under _Section 10.2(a)_. After the Final Release Date, subject to _Section
10.3(e)_, or at the point when no funds remain in the Indemnification Escrow
Account, neither the Seller, LSB nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any liability for any Damages arising pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_
except with respect to any breach relating to a representation or warranty
contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes) or a Fundamental Representation.

 



76 (ii) With respect to any breach relating to any representation or warranty
contained in Fundamental Representations, at the point (i) when no funds
remain in the Indemnification Escrow Account and (ii) no recovery is allowed
under the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, the Purchaser Indemnitees may seek
recovery from the Seller subject to the applicable limitations contained in
this _Article X_; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the point when no funds
remain in the Indemnification Escrow Account and prior to seeking recovery
under the Purchaser RandW Policy with respect to any such breaches, the
Purchaser Indemnitees may (and shall) seek recovery directly from the Seller
in an amount up to, but not exceeding, $2,730,000 (which together with the
Indemnification Escrow Amount is reflective of the required retention amount
under the Purchaser RandW Policy).

(iii) With respect to any breach relating to any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes), at the point when (i) no funds remain in
the Indemnification Escrow Account, and (ii) no recovery is allowed under the
Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, the Purchaser Indemnitees may seek recovery
from the Seller subject to the applicable limitations contained in this
_Article X_; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the point when no funds
remain in the Indemnification Escrow Account and prior to seeking recovery
under the Purchaser RandW Policy with respect to any such breaches, the
Purchaser Indemnitees may (and shall) seek recovery directly from the Seller
in an amount up to, but not exceeding, $2,730,000 (which together with
the Indemnification Escrow Amount is reflective of the required retention
amount under the Purchaser RandW Policy).

(i) _Indemnification Exclusive Remedy_.

(i) From and after the Closing, except (i) as otherwise provided in _Section
2.3_, (ii) in the event of Fraud, or (iii) claims by Purchaser Indemnitees
for recovery under the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, the indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article X_ and _Section 6.8_ shall be
the exclusive remedy of the parties in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement including for any
misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty, covenant,
agreement or undertaking contained herein or in any certificate executed and
delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof; _provided_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the limitations
set forth in this _Article X_ shall apply to any action for specific
performance, injunctive relief, or other equitable remedy. For illustration
purposes only, attached as _Annex E_ are certain recovery scenarios, subject
to the restrictions and limitations in this Agreement.

 

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 10.3(i)(i)_, no party hereto shall have
any liability, and no party hereto shall make any claim for any loss, whether
legal or equitable, and the parties hereto hereby waive any right of
contribution against each other, arising out of this Agreement relating to
Environmental Laws (including the federal Superfund or Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state
laws Superfund laws), whether based on contract, tort or strict liability.

 

(j) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the
Seller, the amount of each claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be deemed to
be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Seller pursuant to _Section
10.2_ shall be limited to, the amount of Damages that remain after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or
other similar payment, in each case, that are actually collected by a
Purchaser Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto.

 



77 (k) The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitees
from and against any Damages arising out of the breach of any of the
representations or warranties made herein unless, within the Survival Period,
Purchaser Indemnitee delivers to the Seller a Notice of Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.5_ or  _Section 10.6_ relating to the breach which gives rise
to such Damages.

(l) In the event of any matter giving rise to an indemnity obligation of the
Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2_, the Purchaser will take, or cause the
applicable CCG Entities to take, reasonable commercial measures to mitigate
the consequences of the matter as required by applicable law. 

(m) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall not have (and hereby
releases) any right of contribution, indemnification or other recourse
against the Company or any other CCG Entity with respect to any pre-Closing
breach by the Company or the Seller of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 

(n) The Seller shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section 10.2_ in
respect of any amount of Damages to the extent reflected on the final Closing
Statement as a deduction in determining the Transaction Price hereunder or to
the extent reflected as a reserve in the Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(o) In any claim for indemnification hereunder, the Seller shall not be
required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee for special,
incidental, exemplary or indirect damages, or for any punitive damages
unless, in each case actually paid to a third party.

(p) The obligation to indemnify the Purchasers officers, directors,
employees and other Purchaser Indemnitees in accordance with this _Article X_
shall be enforceable exclusively by the Purchaser and nothing herein shall
grant such officers, directors, employees or other Purchaser Indemnitees any
individual rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities with respect to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties may amend or modify the
terms hereof in any respect without the consent of such officers, directors,
employees and other Purchaser Indemnitees.

(q) The Purchaser shall treat any payments that the Seller makes or receives
pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment to or refund of (as applicable)
the Transaction Price for federal Tax purposes, unless a final determination
(which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form)
with respect to the Purchaser and the Seller causes such payment not to be
treated as an adjustment to or refund of the Transaction Price for federal Tax
purposes.

 

(r) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.

 



78  The representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller and the Company
and the Purchaser Indemnitees rights to indemnification with respect thereto
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Purchaser (including by any of its Affiliates, and its and
their advisors, consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that
the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or its and their advisors, consultants
or representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Purchasers waiver
of any condition set forth in _Article VII_. 

(s) The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitees
from and against any Damages arising out of any environmental sampling,
testing or investigation of the soil, groundwater, surface water, sediments,
air, or any other environmental media (" _Environmental Tests_ ") by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, or authorized representatives or agents of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, after the Closing on any of the Companys
properties unless the Environmental Tests are conducted (i) to comply with the
specific and reasonably determined requirements of applicable
Environmental Laws or environmental Permits, (ii) in response to a request,
claim, demand or investigation by a Governmental Entity, which request, claim,
demand or investigation has not been invited or deliberately initiated by the
Purchaser or any of Purchasers Affiliates, or (iii) to respond to any
environmental conditions that pose or could reasonably be expected to pose, in
the reasonable judgment of Purchaser or its Affiliates, a material risk of
harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public, the Purchasers and its
Affiliates employees, or the environment.

Section 10.4 _Purchaser s Indemnification Obligations_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from, against and in respect of, and pay or reimburse the Seller
Indemnitees for, any and all Damages (whenever arising or incurred) arising
out of or relating to:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder (including the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_); and

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by
the Purchaser or, after the Closing, the Company in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered hereunder (including the certificate delivered pursuant
to _Section 8.3(b)_).

 

For the purposes of determining under this _Section 10.4_ the amount of any
Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach, such representation and
warranty shall be considered without regard to any qualification by or
reference to the words "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect," "material,"
"materiality," "in all material respects" or any similar words or
qualifications contained therein (other than any qualification or reference
contained in the definition of any defined term used herein).

 



79 (b) The Purchasers indemnification obligations pursuant to the provisions
of  _Section 10.4(a)(i)_ are subject to the following limitations:

(i) Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under  _Section
10.4(a)(i)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the representations
and warranties contained in the Fundamental Representations) any Damages until
the total amount which Seller Indemnitees would recover under  _Section
10.4(a)(i)_ (except for the representations and warranties contained in the
Fundamental Representations) exceeds the Deductible, at which point the
Purchaser shall be liable only for the amounts in excess of the Deductible; 
_provided_ that the Purchaser shall not be liable to indemnify Seller
Indemnitees for any individual claim or claims relating to the same set of
facts and circumstances pursuant to _Section 10.4(a)(i)_ until Seller
Indemnitees have suffered aggregate Damages arising out of such claim or
claims relating to the same set of facts and circumstances equaling or
exceeding $36,000, in which case the Purchaser shall be liable for all Damages
arising out of such claim or claims subject to the limitations of this
_Section 10.4_; and _provided_ _further_ that all claims for which the
Purchaser is not required to indemnify Seller Indemnitees because the
associated Damages do not equal or exceed $36,000 shall also not count
towards the Deductible;

(ii) Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
10.4(a)(i)_ (except with respect to any breach relating to the
representations and warranties contained in the Fundamental Representations)
any Damages to the extent the aggregate claims under _Section 10.4(a)(i)_
(except for the representations and warranties contained in the Fundamental
Representations) of Seller Indemnitees exceed the Purchaser Liability Cap.

(iii) The aggregate liability of the Purchaser for Damages of Seller
Indemnitees under _Section 10.4(a)_ shall not exceed the amount of the final
Transaction Price.

 

(iv) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the
Purchaser, the amount of each claim by a Seller Indemnitee shall be deemed to
be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 10.4_ shall be limited to, the amount of Damages that remain after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions
or other similar payment, in each case, that has actually been collected by a
Seller Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto.

 

(v) The Purchaser shall have no obligation to indemnify any Seller Indemnitees
from and against any Damages arising out of the breach of any of the
representations or warranties made herein unless, within the Survival Period,
Seller Indemnitee delivers to the Purchaser a Notice of Claim pursuant to
_Section 10.5_ or _Section 10.6_ relating to the breach which gives rise to
such Damages.

(vi) In the event of any matter giving rise to an indemnity obligation of the
Purchaser pursuant to this  _Section 10.4_, the Purchaser will take
reasonable commercial measures to mitigate the consequences of the matter as
required by applicable law.

 

(vii) In any claim for indemnification hereunder, the Purchaser shall not be
required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for special, incidental or
exemplary damages, or for any punitive damages unless, in each case actually
paid to a third party.

 



80 (viii) The obligation to indemnify the Sellers officers, directors, employees
and other Seller Indemnitees in accordance with this _Article X_ shall be
enforceable exclusively by the Seller and nothing herein shall grant such
officers, directors, employees or other Seller Indemnitees any individual
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities with respect to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties may amend or modify the terms hereof
in any respect without the consent of such officers, directors, employees and
other Seller Indemnitees.

 

(ix) The Seller shall treat any payments that the Purchaser makes or receives
pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment to or refund of (as
applicable) the Transaction Price for federal Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to the Purchaser and the Seller causes such payment not to
be treated as an adjustment to or refund of the Transaction Price for federal
Tax purposes.

 

Section 10.5 _Non-Third Party Claims Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified
Party claims a right to payment pursuant hereto, such Indemnified Party shall
send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party (a "
_Notice of Claim_ "). Such Notice of Claim shall specify the legal and factual
basis for such claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim made
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.4_, as applicable, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being
understood that any Notice of Claim for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period for such representation or warranty.

Section 10.6 _Third Party Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) Following the receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, the party
receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall promptly (i) notify the
other party of its existence setting forth with reasonable specificity the
facts and circumstances of which such party has received notice and (ii) if
the party giving such notice is an Indemnified Party, specifying the legal
and factual basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification is asserted; _provided_ that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
hereunder with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that,
such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results in (x) the forfeiture
by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (y) actual material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of notice of
a Third Party Claim, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and shall be solely
responsible for the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. The
Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such
Third Party Claim after it notifies the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party
Claim prior to the time that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party
of its election in accordance with the preceding sentence to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails or is not entitled hereunder to assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim

 



81  as provided herein or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, in either case within such thirty (30) day period, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense and,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Damages in respect of such Third Party Claim
shall include the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel
for the Indemnified Party as incurred. If the Indemnified Party in good faith
determines that the Third Party Claim involves an issue or matter which could
reasonably have a material adverse effect on the Business or the assets of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to
take over and control the defense, settlement, negotiation or litigation
relating to any such Third Party Claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying
Party, _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party does so take over and control,
the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

(b) In any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is being sought
hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not
assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in
such matter and to retain its own counsel at such partys own expense;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense
of such claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that there may be defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or
(iii) the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party
in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there is a
conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall
at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the other Party reasonably
apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of which it is
maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the
defense of any such matter.

 

(d) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No Indemnifying
Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent (x) includes, as a condition of such settlement,
compromise or consent, a complete and unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from any and all liability arising out of such claim, (y)
does not contain any finding, admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing, violation of Law, or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party
and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any
manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified
Party or otherwise encumbers any of the assets of the Indemnified Party.

 



82 Section 10.7 _Recoveries from Third Persons; Duplicative Recoveries_.

 

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has
indemnified it pursuant hereto, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over
to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom
the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be required to pay over to the
Seller any amounts recovered pursuant to the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy,
unless such amounts are duplicative of amounts paid by the Seller with
respect to any Purchaser Indemnification Claim.

(b) No Indemnified Party may recover Damages from an Indemnifying Party under
this _Article X_ to the extent such recovery would result in duplicative
recovery for the same Damages.

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and

contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral
and written, with respect thereto, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 11.5  _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their

respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of laws
principles, to the extent such principles would require or permit the

Section 11.10 _Disclosure Letters_.

 

(a) Disclosure of any fact or item in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other
Section to which such disclosure is relevant to the extent that the relevance
of such item to such other Section is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item. The inclusion of any specific item in any Section of the Company

other

 



85  items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes hereof.

(b) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment
of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used
in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any
schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement (other than
with respect to any representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement
in which such specification occurs).

Section 11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Delaware and the courts of the United States
for the District of Delaware, and the appellate courts thereof, solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated herein, and hereby
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto, that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), that such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in
said courts, that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the
venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware state or federal court. The
parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree
that delivery of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 11.3_ hereof or in such other
manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver, (ii) such party understands and has considered the
implication of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver voluntarily and
(iv) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section.

 



86 Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any
portion thereof had never been contained herein.

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement, without any bond or other security being required, such
requirement being hereby waived, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section 11.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 11.3_ shall in any
way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which the
Purchaser or any other Purchaser Related Party may be liable under this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) To the extent any party hereto brings any Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than a Proceeding to specifically enforce any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2_
hereof) when such remedy is expressly available to such party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended
by (i) the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus twenty
(20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding.

Section 11.14 _Conflicts and Privilege_. The parties agree that, in the event
a dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser or the Company, on
the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. may
represent the Seller in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller
may be directly adverse to the Company, and even though Vinson and Elkins
L.L.P. may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company. The parties
further agree that, as to all communications between Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.,
the Company and the Seller, that relate in any way to this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Seller may be controlled by the Seller, and shall not pass to or be
claimed or controlled by the Company; _provided_ that the Seller shall not
waive such attorney-client privilege other than to the extent appropriate in
connection with the enforcement or defense of its rights or
obligations existing under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event a dispute arises between the Purchaser or the Company and a Person
other than the Seller after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by
Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. to such Person.



 



87 Section 11.15 _Seller Guarantee_. All of the Sellers obligations hereunder
are hereby guaranteed by LSB. LSB hereby acknowledges and agrees that it
shall cause the Seller to comply with all of the Sellers obligations under
this Agreement (" _Seller Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and in the event the
Seller fails to comply with any such obligations, it shall intervene to
perform, or cause to be performed, such obligations in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not
of collectability. LSB agrees that, for so long as the Seller is an affiliate
of LSB, the Purchaser and the Seller may at any time and from time to time,
without notice to LSB or LSBs further consent, extend the term of this
Agreement and make any agreement with the Seller or any Person liable with
respect to any of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations hereunder for the
extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in
whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of
any agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller or any such other Person
without in any way impairing or affecting any of its Seller Guaranteed
Obligations hereunder. LSB agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be
released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the
failure of any of the Purchaser Related Parties to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any right or remedy against the Seller or any other Person
liable with respect to any of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any
change in the time, place or manner of payment of any Seller Guaranteed
Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Agreement
or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any change in
the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Seller or any other
Person liable with respect to any of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations; (d)
any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting the Seller or any other Person liable with respect to any of the
Seller Guaranteed Obligations; (e) the existence of any right of set-off
which LSB may have at any time against the Purchaser Related Parties, whether
in connection with any Seller Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or (f) the
adequacy of any other means the Purchaser may have of obtaining payment of
any Seller Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, LSB
hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of
any Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by any of the
Purchaser Related Parties. LSB waives promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this guarantee and of any Seller Guaranteed Obligation,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the incurrence of any Seller Guaranteed Obligations
and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by
virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the
Purchaser or any other Person liable with respect to the Seller Guaranteed
Obligations and all suretyship defenses generally. LSB acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this guarantee
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

 



88 Section 11.16 _Purchaser Guarantee_. All of the Purchasers obligations
hereunder are hereby guaranteed by NIBE. NIBE hereby acknowledges and agrees
that it shall cause the Purchaser to comply with all of the Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement (" _Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and
in the event the Purchaser fails to comply with any such obligations, it
shall intervene to perform, or cause to be performed, such obligations in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This is an unconditional
guarantee of payment and not of collectability. NIBE agrees that, for so long
as the Purchaser is an affiliate of NIBE, the Purchaser and the Seller may at
any time and from time to time, without notice to NIBE or NIBEs further
consent, extend the term of this Agreement and make any agreement with the
Seller or any Person liable with respect to any of the Purchaser Guaranteed
Obligations hereunder for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of
the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller or
any such other Person without in any way impairing or affecting any of its
Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. NIBE agrees that its obligations
hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any of the Seller Related Parties to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the
Seller or any other Person liable with respect to any of the Purchaser
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment
of any Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of the Agreement or any other agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with any of the Purchaser Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure or
ownership of the Purchaser or any other Person liable with respect to any of
the Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations; (d) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Purchaser or any
other Person liable with respect to any of the Purchaser Guaranteed
Obligations; (e) the existence of any right of set-off which NIBE may have at
any time against the Seller Related Parties, whether in connection with any
Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or (f) the adequacy of any
other means the Seller may have of obtaining payment of any Purchaser
Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, NIBE hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law
which would otherwise require any election of remedies by any of the Seller
Related Parties. NIBE waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance
of this guarantee and of any Purchaser Guaranteed Obligation, presentment,
demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest,
notice of the incurrence of any Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations and all other
notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Seller or any
other Person liable with respect to the Purchaser Guaranteed Obligations and
all suretyship defenses generally. NIBE acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this guarantee are knowingly
made in contemplation of such benefits.
