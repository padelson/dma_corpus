AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of August 6, 2019 by and among Inogen, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), Move Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer ("Merger Sub"), New Aera, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and Gregory J. Kapust as the representative of the Entitled
Holders (the "Entitled Holders' Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Appendix A
attached hereto.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Buyer wishes to acquire the Company through a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the Company
will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer;

 

WHEREAS, the respective Board of Directors of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company deems it advisable and in the best interests of its respective
stockholders to consummate the Merger and has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger);

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Buyer to enter
into this Agreement, the Non-Compete Stockholders have executed and delivered
to Buyer a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Non-Compete Agreements") to be
effective as of the Closing; and

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

 

Article I 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1The Merger

 

. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and

Merger, is referred to hereinafter as the "Surviving Corporation."

   

Section 1.2Closing

 

. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VI, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall be effected as promptly as
practical but in no event later than the date that is three (3) Business Days
after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article V
of this Agreement (other than conditions which can be satisfied only by the
delivery of certificates or other documents at the Closing) at the offices of
Dorsey and Whitney LLP, 305 Lytton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301, unless a
different date, time and/or place is agreed to by the parties hereto. The
date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing
Date".

 

Section 1.3Effective Time

 

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing the Certificate of Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger,
with acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as shall be agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter
referred to as, the "Effective Time"). The parties hereto shall make all
other filings, recordings or publications required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger.

 

Section 1.4Effect of the Merger

 

. From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

 

Section 1.5Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

 



 

(a)Immediately upon the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in Exhibit A of the
Certificate of Merger, and such certificate of incorporation shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Law and such certificate of incorporation.

 

(b)Immediately upon the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such bylaws.

 

Section 1.6Directors; Officers

 

. The directors and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and
officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors
shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

   

Section 1.7Merger Consideration

 

.

 

(a)Merger Consideration. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Entitled Holders shall be entitled
to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (without
duplication):

 

(i)$70,400,000 (the "Merger Consideration"); plus

 

(ii)the aggregate amount of all Closing Date Company Cash; minus

 

(iii)the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses; minus

 

(iv)all Closing Date Company Indebtedness; minus

 

(v)the payment to Silverbow, as described in Section 2 of the Termination and
Release Agreement; minus

 

(vi)the payment to Silverbow, as described in Section 1(a) of the IP
Acquisition Agreement (the Merger Consideration as so adjusted, the
"Stockholder Merger Consideration")

 

(b)Escrow. At the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of the Entitled Holders, shall
deposit with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent"), a
portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration equal to $8,000,000 in cash
(the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund shall be held in trust by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C and shall be released in accordance with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto agree that any payment of the Escrow Fund to
Entitled Holders shall constitute part of the Stockholder Merger Consideration
and is intended to qualify for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of
the Code.

 

(c)Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund. At the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of
the Entitled Holders, shall deposit with the Entitled Holders' Agent, a
portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration equal to the Entitled Holders'
Agent Expense Amount (including and distributions received pursuant to Section
1.11(d) and Section 7.4, the "Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund"). The
Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund shall be held in trust by the Entitled
Holders' Agent to be held for the purpose of funding any expenses of Entitled
Holders' Agent arising in connection with the administration of Entitled
Holders' Agent's duties in this Agreement after the Closing and the
indemnification of the Seller Agents in accordance with Section 7.9. For the
avoidance of doubt, for all income Tax purposes, the Entitled Holders' Agent
Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Entitled Holders (i) with respect to the Entitled Holders' Agent
Expense Amount, at the Closing, and (ii) with respect to any funds received by
the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund thereafter, at such time.

   

Section 1.8Effect on Capital Stock

rights for such shares in accordance with in Section 262 of the DGCL or, if
applicable, dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with Chapter 13
of the CCC, and who, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, has not

will forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share will
thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished and, if applicable,
converted, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, into and represent the
right to receive the respective portion of the Stockholder Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.8(c) and the respective portion of the

Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or settle or offer to settle any such demand.

(i)Termination of Options and Option Plans. The Company shall have taken all
actions prior to the Effective Time such that all stock incentive plans

be released), divided by (II) the Adjusted Diluted Share Number; and

 

(D)the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such In-The-Money Company Options and (2) a fraction equal to (I) the

Closing Date Company Indebtedness and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, and
any necessary Tax forms, including W-9 or the appropriate series of W-8, as

expressly survive repayment in full) and, with respect to Closing Date Company
Indebtedness, shall contemplate the delivery of UCC-3

Section 1.9Surrender and Payment

 

.

 

(a)Not less than one (1) day prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and the
Entitled Holders' Agent shall enter into a paying agent agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Paying Agent Agreement") with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging Company Certificate(s) for the Stockholder Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article I. Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent shall
each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.
At or substantially contemporaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the Stockholder Merger Consideration (less the
aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of In-the-Money Company
Options, pursuant to Section 1.8(f)(ii)) (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than the payment of the Stockholder Merger Consideration and
shall not be subject to any claim of Buyer under Section 1.7, Section 4.7 or
Article VII. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as set
forth in the Paying Agent Agreement. Any losses resulting from the investment
of the Exchange Fund shall not in any way diminish Buyer\'s obligations to pay
the full amount of the Stockholder Merger Consideration. At or substantially
contemporaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company the aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration allocable to holders of In-the-Money Company
Options pursuant to Section 1.8(f).

 

(b)Company Certificate Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver and make
available to each Company Stockholder (other than Buyer or the Company, if
applicable) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E
(the "Letter of Transmittal"). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of, with
respect to Company Stockholders, a certificate or certificates evidencing the
Company Capital Stock (the "Company Certificate(s)") for cancellation,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent
shall, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cause the Paying
Agent to pay to the holder of such Company Certificate, in exchange therefore,
the amount of cash in immediately available funds which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Company Capital Stock formerly represented
by such Company Certificate pursuant to Section 1.8(c), and the Company
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the relevant portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Company Certificate representing such Company

   

Capital Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the relevant portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Company Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Buyer that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.9, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender (or at such other applicable time) such portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration and the Earnout Consideration to which the
holder of such Company Certificate is entitled pursuant and subject to this
Section 1.9. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Company Certificate(s) pursuant to the provisions of this Section
1.9.

Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming the Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, the delivery of an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate
the applicable portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Company Capital Stock represented by such Company Certificate
as contemplated by this Section 1.9. No Company Stockholder shall be required
to post any bond in respect of any lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate.

 

(d)No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company
Capital Stock represented by such Company Certificates, except the right to
receive the Stockholder Merger Consideration and the Earnout Consideration to
which such holder is entitled or as provided by Law. 

 

(e)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Company Stockholders twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand, and any Company
Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.9 shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for, and Buyer shall remain liable for, payment
of their claim with respect to the Stockholder Merger Consideration without
any interest thereon. 

 

(f)Stock Option Cancellation Procedures. Subject to delivery of a duly
completed and validly executed option cancellation agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (each, a "Option Cancellation Agreement") from
any holder of In-The-Money Company Options in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, such holder of In-The-Money Company Options shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, from the Company's payroll in the next
practicable payroll cycle following such delivery and the Closing, the Closing
Option Payment that such holder shall have the right to receive as set forth
in Section 1.8(f)(ii)(A) of this Agreement with respect to such In-The-Money
Company Options. Further, subject to delivery of a duly completed and validly
executed Option Cancellation Agreement, each such former holder of In-The-
Money Company Options shall have the right to receive such holder's portion of
the Earnout Consideration, such

   

holder's portion of the Escrow Fund, and such holder's portion of the Entitled
Holders' Agent Expense Fund with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such In-The-Money Company Options in accordance with the applicable
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Until
cancelled in accordance with this Section 1.9(f), each In-The-Money Company
Option will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence the right to receive the holder's Closing Option
Payment, portion of the Earnout Consideration, if any, portion of the Escrow
Fund, if any, and portion of the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund, if any,
that such holder shall have the right to receive as set forth in Section
1.8(f)(ii) of this Agreement.

 

(g)Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 1.9 shall also apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Buyer under this Section 1.9 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such shares the aggregate portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration
that such holder shall have the right to receive as set forth in Section
1.8(c) of this Agreement.

in this Article I.

Entitled Holders' Agent will advise Buyer in writing whether it agrees with
the Earnout Payment for the applicable period set forth in such Earnout
Statement or whether the Entitled Holders' Agent objects to such Earnout
Payment. If the Entitled Holders' Agent disputes the Earnout Payment set

statement setting forth its objections thereto, including, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, the dollar amounts involved and the

Objection Period, the Earnout Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. The Entitled Holders' Agent and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections made by the Entitled
Holders' Agent. If they do not reach a final resolution within forty-five (45)
days after the delivery of such Earnout Objection Statement, the Entitled
Holders' Agent and Buyer shall submit the any amount under dispute (the
"Disputed Amount") for final resolution to a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm upon which Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent shall
reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall act as an
expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall make all calculations
in accordance with the applicable Accounting Standards, shall determine only
the Disputed Amount remaining in dispute between Buyer and the Entitled
Holders' Agent, and shall not be permitted or authorized to assign a dollar
amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. Each of Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent shall (i)
enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm at the time
such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with
the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a written statement
in support of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items,
to provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a
written statement responding to the other party's position with respect to
such disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality agreement,
provide the Accounting Firm with access to their respective books, records,
personnel and representatives and such other information as the Accounting
Firm may require in order to render its determination. The Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent a
written determination (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth
all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be
based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer and the
Entitled Holders' Agent) of the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar
days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Entitled Holders' Agent, on the other hand, based on a percentage
equal to (i) the portion of the total amounts disputed not awarded to each
such party divided by (ii) the total amounts disputed.

   

(d)Payment Procedures. Subject to Section 7.7:

 

(i)Within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Earnout Statement, Buyer
shall deposit in the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund an amount equal to
the Undisputed Amount. 

 

(ii)Within fifteen (15) days after the final determination of the amount of
each Earnout Payment, Buyer shall deposit in the Entitled Holders' Agent
Expense Fund an amount equal to such corresponding Earnout Payment, less any
Undisputed Amounts deposited in the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund
pursuant to Section 1.11(d)(i) with respect to such corresponding Earnout
Payment.

 

(iii)The Entitled Holders' Agent shall cause disbursements to the Entitled
Holders from the Entitled Holders' Expense Fund in such amounts as it
reasonably determines based on the necessity of withholding funds to satisfy
potential obligations of the Entitled Holders' Agent from the Entitled
Holders' Agent Expense Fund pursuant to Article VII; provided, however, that
the Entitled Holders' Agent may from time to time make such proportionate
discretionary distributions to the Entitled Holders in the Entitled Holders'

shall exercise operational control of the business and assets of the Company.
The Entitled Holders and the Company acknowledge, understand and agree that
the future development, use and/or commercialization activities of the Company

business judgment and in their sole and absolute discretion. Subject to
compliance with Section 1.11(f), the Entitled Holders and the Company further
acknowledge, understand and agree that: (i) as between the parties, Buyer and
its Affiliates will have complete control and sole and absolute discretion
with respect to decisions concerning such activities as well as the conduct of
the Company's business, (ii) such control and discretion over such activities
and the conduct of the Company's business by or under the authority of Buyer
and its Affiliates could have a material adverse effect upon any amount of
Earnout Consideration, (iii) such control and discretion by Buyer and its
Affiliates over the matters set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above could
result in the Entitled Holders receiving no amounts whatsoever with respect to
Earnout Consideration, and (iv) Buyer and its Affiliates have no duty to the
Company or the Entitled Holders to maximize Net Sales, Net Licensing Revenue
or the Earnout Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall use

Property; (ii) grants, or purports to grant, to any Person any rights or
immunities under any Company Intellectual Property; (iii) requires any Company

free from malicious code and do not contain any bugs, errors, vulnerabilities
or problems that, in each case, would be expected to materially adversely
affect the operation or use thereof. There has not been any material (i)
unauthorized intrusions or breach of the security of the Company IT Assets,
(ii) malfunction of the Company IT Assets or (iii) accidental or unauthorized

the Company (including the development, manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale
and other exploitation of Company Products), to the Company's Knowledge, has

not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property of
any Person. To the Company's Knowledge, the Company's rights in the Company
Intellectual Property are valid, subsisting and enforceable. To the Company's
Knowledge, the Company has at all times taken, and has caused its Affiliates
to take, commercially reasonable measures to maintain, protect and defend
(and, in any case, all actions required under applicable Law or Contract) the
rights of the Company and its Affiliates in and to all Company Intellectual
Property, and to ensure that confidential information and trade secrets
therein are protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, use,
modification, or other misuse, including requiring all Persons having access

that have resulted in a third party obtaining access to any confidential,
personal or proprietary information of either Company or its Affiliates or any
of their employees. Company has complied in all material respects with all
applicable contractual and legal requirements pertaining to information
privacy and security.

brought, are currently pending, or, to the Company's Knowledge, are threatened
against Company by any Person alleging a violation of any rights relating to
the use, collection, storage, distribution, handling, processing,
transferring, or disclosure of any personally identifiable or private
information.

 

(n)Neither the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor the conduct of the business and
operations of the Company as presently conducted and as currently proposed to
be conducted will result in (i) Company granting to any third party any right
to or with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed to, the
Company, (ii) Company being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete, non-
solicit or other restriction on the operation or scope of its business, or
(iii) Company being obligated to pay any royalties or other fees or
consideration with respect to Intellectual Property of any other Person in
excess of those payable by Company in the absence of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Closing, Company will have the
right to exercise all of its current rights under agreements granting rights
to Company with respect to Intellectual Property of a third party to the same
extent and in the same manner they would have been able to had the
transactions contemplated hereby not occurred.

injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.3 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 4.4Public Disclosure; Non-Disparagement

 

. Buyer and the Company shall, prior to the Closing, consult with each other
before issuing or authorizing any press release or any other public statement
or making (or authorizing) any other disclosure to any third party (whether or
not in response to an inquiry) regarding the existence or terms of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the
dissemination of the initial substantive press release to be broadly
disseminated concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, neither the Buyer, nor the Entitled Holders' Agent shall (or permit
any of their respective subsidiaries, representatives or advisors to) issue
any such press release or make any such statement or disclosure without the
prior written approval of the other, except as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the disclosing party shall provide to the
other party such advance notice as is reasonable under the circumstances prior
to the making of, and shall consult with the other party regarding the form
of, such required disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the
Company may reveal the existence and terms of this Agreement to their
respective

   

representatives and advisors (a) who need to know the terms of this Agreement
for the purpose of evaluating the Merger, (b) who are informed of the
confidential nature of the Agreement, and (c) who agree to act in accordance
with the terms of this Section 4.4. Each of the Buyer and the Company
covenants and agrees that neither it nor any of its respective Affiliates
shall in any way, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others,
cause, express or cause to be expressed in a public manner or to any
stockholder, investor, analyst, journalist or member of the media (including,
without limitation, in a television, radio, internet, newspaper or magazine
interview), orally or in writing, any remarks, statements, comments or
criticisms that disparage, call into disrepute, defame, slander or which can
reasonably be construed to be defamatory or slanderous to the other party or
such other party's Affiliates, successors, assigns, officers (including,
without limitation, any current officer of a party or a party's subsidiaries
who no longer serves in such capacity following the Effective Time), directors
(including any current director of a party or a party's subsidiaries who no
longer serves in such capacity following the Effective Time), employees,
stockholders, agents, attorneys or representatives, any of their products or
services or any action or matter publicly disclosed prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 

Section 4.5Notices, Consents, Amendments and Terminations

 

. Prior to the Closing, the Company (a) shall send the notices, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents, waivers and approvals,
required under each Contract, and (b) amend or terminate each Contract, in
each of cases (a) and (b), as set forth in Schedule 4.5, which notices,
consents, waivers, approvals, amendments and terminations shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

Section 4.6Commercially Reasonable Efforts and Further Assurances

 

. Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, actions
necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable Laws) to consummate
and make effective the Merger as promptly as practicable including, but not
limited to, the satisfaction of the other parties' conditions to Closing.

 

Section 4.7Tax Matters

 

.

 

(a)Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for all Tax periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are due to be filed after the Closing Date.
All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Company's past practices unless otherwise required by applicable Law;
provided, however, that Tax Returns for the period that includes or ends on
the Closing Date shall include Transaction Tax Deductions to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, further, that all Transaction
Tax Deductions arising on or attributable to the Closing Date (or prior to the
Closing Date) shall be treated as deductions in the income tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date and that no party shall take a
position inconsistent with the foregoing. Buyer shall provide copies of all
income and other material Tax Returns described in this Section 4.7(a) that
reflect a Tax for which the Entitled Holders would reasonably be expected to
be liable for under this Agreement to the Entitled Holders' Agent at least
twenty (20) days prior to their timely filing due date (for income Tax
Returns) and five (5) days prior to their timely filing due date (for other
material Tax Returns), in each case taking into account extensions, and shall
incorporate the Entitled Holders' Agent's reasonable comments to such Tax
Returns prior to their filing. 

   

(b)Transfer Taxes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes") shall be paid by Buyer and the Company when due, in equal proportions,
and Buyer and the Company shall jointly file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, fees and charges,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

(c)Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, any real, personal,
ad valorem, intangible property Taxes or other Taxes that accrue based upon
the passage of time for any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period") shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a per diem
basis, and all other Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated as if
such Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date, except that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions), other than with respect to property
placed in service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis.

 

(d)Amended Returns. None of Buyer, Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates
shall, or shall cause or permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend any Tax
Returns of Company for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or
make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any period ending before
the Closing Date if such amendment or election would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a Tax for which the Entitled Holders would reasonably be expected
to be liable for under this Agreement without the Entitled Holders' Agent's
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 4.8Stockholder Approval; Joinder Agreements; Option Cancellation
Agreements. 

 

(a)Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
solicit written consent from each of the Company Stockholders in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Stockholder Written Consent"). Within four
(4) hours after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer the Stockholder Written Consents from Company Stockholders pursuant to
the preceding solicitation that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably
deliver the Requisite Approval.

 

(b)Promptly upon obtaining the Requisite Approval, the Company shall prepare
and, as soon as reasonably practicable, send to all Company Stockholders as of
the record date for the Stockholder Written Consent who did not execute a
Stockholder Written Consent the notices required pursuant to the DGCL and, if
applicable, the CCC. Such materials submitted to the Company Stockholders in
connection with such Stockholder Written Consents shall be subject to review
and comment by Buyer and shall include an information statement regarding the
Company, the terms of this Agreement and the Merger and the unanimous
recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors that the Company
Stockholders not exercise their dissenters or appraisal rights under any
applicable Law in connection with the

   

Merger (the "Information Statement"). The parties shall update, amend and
supplement the Information Statement from time to time as may be required by
applicable Law. The information prepared by the Company furnished on or in
any document mailed, delivered or otherwise furnished to Company Stockholders
by the Company in connection with the solicitation of their consent to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated will not contain, at or prior to
the Effective Time, any untrue statement of a material fact and will not omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading.

 

(c)As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each
Company Stockholder to deliver to Buyer a duly executed joinder agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (each, a "Joinder
Agreement" and collectively, the "Joinder Agreements") and (ii) each holder of
In-The-Money Company Options to deliver to Buyer a duly executed Option
Cancellation Agreement.

 

Section 4.9280G Stockholder Approval.

 

(a)Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later
than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyer a waiver agreement,
substantially in the form approved by Buyer (a "280G Waiver"), from each
Person who the Company, in consultation with Buyer, reasonably believes is,
with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the
initiation of the solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholder approval
described in Section 4.9(b) and who might otherwise receive or have the right
or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code,
unless the requisite Company Stockholder approval of such parachute payments
is obtained pursuant to Section 4.9(b).

 

(b)Promptly following the delivery by the Company to Buyer of each 280G Waiver
described in Section 4.9(a), the Company shall submit to the Company
Stockholders for approval (in a form and manner reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer) by such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments or benefits that are subject to
a 280G Waiver and that Buyer determines may separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and
benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Buyer
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (i) that a Company Stockholder vote
was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with
respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the Company
Stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be
made or provided, pursuant to the waivers of those payments or benefits which
were executed by the affected individuals on the date of this Agreement.

   

Section 4.10Access to Information; Confidentiality

 

.

 

(a)From and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time or such
earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms,
subject to compliance with applicable Law and Section 4.10(b), the Company
shall, with reasonable advance notice, (i) give Buyer and its representatives
reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Company during normal business hours, (ii) furnish to Buyer and its
representatives such financial and operating data and all other information as
such Persons may reasonably request, and (iii) shall cooperate with Buyer in
its investigation of the business of the Company. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses
of the Company that may result from requests for access, data and information
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
to provide any information (i) that it reasonably believes it may not provide
to Buyer by reason of contractual or legal restrictions, including applicable
Laws, or which it believes is competitively sensitive information or (ii) the
disclosure of which would be expected to jeopardize attorney-client or any
other privilege applicable to such information. In addition, the Company may
designate any competitively sensitive information provided to Buyer under this
Agreement as "outside counsel only" and such information shall be given only
to the outside counsel of Buyer and may not be shared with Buyer or any of its
representatives (other than such outside counsel).

 

(b)All information provided or obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be kept confidential by Buyer
in accordance with the terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated
November 7, 2018, between Buyer and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall govern.

 

Section 4.11Employee Matters.

 

(a)Buyer shall provide offer letters to each employee of the Company who is
employed with the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such employee who
is offered employment with Buyer to accept such offer, including causing such
employee to execute and deliver an employment offer letter and proprietary
information and invention assignment agreement, each on Buyer's form. For the
one-year period following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide each employee
of the Company that accepts such offers (other than the Key Employee) (the
"Continuing Employees") with compensation and benefits that, with respect to
each Continuing Employee, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee under the
Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   

(b)Buyer shall give the Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of benefits (including, for purposes
of vacation and severance) under any benefit plans maintained by Buyer for
such Continuing Employees' service with the Company (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not include service with Silverbow or any other Person besides
the Company) to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

 

(c)Buyer shall (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any
plan that provides health benefits in which Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing to the extent such conditions
are covered under the analogous Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Effective Time and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee
or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Company Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Employee listed on Section 2.13(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to have entered into and executed, and each person who
becomes an Employee of the Company after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing shall be required by the Company to enter into and execute, a
proprietary information and invention assignment agreement with the Company
effective as of such Employee's first date of employment or service and in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the "PIIAs").

 

(e)Unless Buyer provides written notice to the Company to the contrary, (i)
effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate the Company's
participation in any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan"), and (ii) effective as of
no later than immediately prior to the Closing, each of the Company and any
ERISA Affiliate shall terminate the service agreement between the Company and
TriNet (the "TriNet Agreement") and the Company's participation in any and all
Company Employee Plans that provide any health and welfare benefits (together
with the 401(k) Plan, the "Terminated Company Employee Plans"). Unless Buyer
provides such written notice to the Company as contemplated in the foregoing
sentence, (x) no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that the Company's participation
in each 401(k) Plan has been terminated and the participation of each Employee
in each 401(k) Plan has been terminated, as applicable (effective as of no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date), pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or such ERISA Affiliate,
and (y) prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence
that TriNet Agreement and the Company's participation in all other Terminated
Company Employee Plans

   

have been terminated. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to the reasonable prior review and approval of Buyer. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of the foregoing as Buyer
may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the TriNet Agreement
or the Company's participation in any Terminated Company Employee Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees, then such charges or fees shall be included in Transaction
Expenses of the Company and shall be the responsibility of the Company, and
the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate
the amount of such charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to
Buyer no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 

(f)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay out all vacation, and/or paid
time off that has been accrued but unused by any Employee, as well as all
accrued wages, earned but unpaid bonuses, unreimbursed business expenses, and
other accrued but unpaid benefits of any Employee as of the Closing Date.

 

(g)The provisions contained in this Section 4.11 are included for the sole
benefit of the Company and Buyer and nothing in this Section 4.11, whether
express or implied, shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any current or former employees, any
participant in any Company Employee Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or
limitation on the ability to terminate any Company Employee Plans or benefit
plan or agreement of Buyer or (iii) limit the ability of Buyer, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time.

 

Section 4.12Notification of Certain Matters

 

. The Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer of: (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is
likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time,
and (b) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
4.12 shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the
party receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission
of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this
Section 4.12, however, shall affect or be deemed to qualify, limit, modify,
amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained herein or in the
Company Disclosure Schedules, the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the rights of Buyer or any Indemnified Party under or arising
out of a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.13Resignation of Directors and Officers

 

. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause each officer and director of
the Company to execute a resignation letter in the form set forth on Exhibit I
(the "Resignation Letters"), to be effective as of the Effective Time.

   

Section 4.14Indemnification; DandO Insurance

 

(a)Buyer and the Company agree that, until the later of (i) six (6) years
after the Closing and (ii) such time as the Earnout Cap has been paid to the
Entitled Holders, Buyer shall cause, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each of the Company's present and former directors and
officers (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees"), in their capacities as
such, to be indemnified by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to the same
extent as provided in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, and any
indemnification agreements between the Company and the Company Indemnitees
disclosed in Section 2.21(a)(xvii) of the Company Disclosure Schedules as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b)The Company will purchase prior to the Closing for each Company Indemnitee
either (i) for a period from the Closing through and including the date six
(6) years after the Closing Date directors' and officers' liability insurance
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Closing, which insurance policy shall contain substantially the same
coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous
than, in the aggregate, the coverage provided by the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on the date hereof; or
(ii) a "tail" insurance policy (the "Tail Policy") with a claims period from
the Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the Closing
Date with substantially the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on the
date hereof. Until the date that is six (6) years after the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall not take any actions to terminate,
cancel or modify, or to cause the termination, cancellation, modification or
lapse in, any directors' and officers' liability insurance policy obtained
pursuant to this Section 4.14(b).

 

(c)It is expressly agreed that the covenants contained in this Section 4.14
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Company Indemnitees and their respective heirs and legal representatives
and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Company
Indemnitee is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

(d)In the event Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors and assigns), shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.14.

 

(e)The obligations of the Surviving Corporation and Buyer under this this
Section 4.14 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to affect adversely any Company Indemnitee to whom this
this Section 4.14 applies without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee. The obligations of Buyer under this Section 4.14 are in addition
to and separate from any indemnification provided to any Company Indemnitee,
Seller Agent or Entitled Holder under Section 7.6 or Section 7.9, and a
determination on entitlement under one source of indemnification shall have no
effect on another source of indemnification (except to the extent the same
Damages would be indemnified for twice).

   

Section 4.15Transition Services.

 

During the ninety (90) days following the Closing, the Entitled Holders' Agent
agrees to provide Buyer with any reasonably requested services, in an amount
not to exceed thirty (30) hours in the aggregate, as may be necessary for the
transition of the business of the Company. The Entitled Holders' Agent shall
not be obligated to perform any services except as described in this Section
4.15; provided, however, that if Buyer desires and Entitled Holders' Agent
agrees to continue to perform any additional services, the parties shall
negotiate the terms and cost of such service.

effectively held harmless or otherwise compensated for such Damages other than
pursuant to this Article VII.

 

(iv)No claim for indemnification may be asserted following the expiration, as
provided in Section 7.1, of the representation, warranty, covenant or

representations and warranties to which such claim relates, as applicable.

contrary, nothing herein shall preclude an Indemnified Party from bringing an
action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

covenants, or any other indemnity, in this Agreement. If an Indemnified

Entitled Holders' Agent shall disperse, or cause to be dispersed, to the
Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund the amount of the Escrow Fund then-
remaining in the Escrow to be released to the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense
Fund; provided, however, that the all or a portion of the Escrow Fund shall be
required to remain in the Escrow after the Escrow Period until, with respect
to (I) a Threatened Claim, the expiration of the 180 (one hundred and eighty)
day period following receipt of such initial threat (unless it has become an

resolution of such Open Claim, (or such longer period as agreed to by the
Buyer and the Entitled Holders' Agent), in an amount sufficient to satisfy any
unsatisfied claims relating to such Open Claim or Threatened Claim as

Section 7.5Indemnification Claims

 

.

 

(a)Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim (a "Claim") under this Article
VII, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim Notice")
to the Entitled Holders' Agent (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) (or in the
event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue such indemnification claim
directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party directly)
(i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain
Damages, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such
Damages, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of
the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. An Indemnified Party may update a Claim Notice from time to time to
reflect any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth in
such Claim Notice.

 

(b)If the Entitled Holders' Agent on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or
the Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the thirty (30) day period after receipt of a Claim Notice (the
"Objection Period") by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting an
objection to the applicable Claim (an "Objection Notice"), such failure to so
object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Entitled Holders' Agent
on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party)
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for
Damages set forth in such Claim Notice, and such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover in accordance with Section 7.5(e). 

   

(c)In the event that the Entitled Holders' Agent (or in the event that
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party,
such Indemnifying Party) shall deliver an Objection Notice within the
Objection Period, the Entitled Holders' Agent (or such objecting Indemnifying
Party) and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to the applicable Claim within the thirty (30)
day period following delivery of such Objection Notice (the "Dispute Period").
If the Entitled Holders' Agent (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and
Buyer should so agree, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
the agreed upon amount of Damages in accordance with Section 7.5(e).

 

(d)If no agreement can be reached with respect to the amount of Damages with
respect to a Claim after good faith negotiation and prior to the end of the
Dispute Period:

 

(i)With respect to any portion thereof to which the parties do not dispute,
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover such undisputed amount of
Damages in accordance with Section 7.5(e); and

 

(ii)With respect to any portion thereof to which the parties continue to
dispute, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(e)In the event any Damages become payable to an Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VII, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3, such
Damages shall be recovered as follows:

 

(i)First, by recovery from the Escrow Fund, in which case Buyer and the
Entitled Holders' Agent shall promptly cause the Escrow Agent to release from
the Escrow Fund cash equal to the amount owed to such Indemnified Party, or
such lesser amount remaining in the Escrow Fund;

 

(ii)Second, should recovery pursuant to Section 7.5(e)(i) above, if any, be
insufficient to satisfy the amount owed to an Indemnified Party in accordance
with this Section 7.5, the remaining amount shall be set off from any Earnout
Consideration pursuant to Section 7.7;

 

(iii)Third, should recovery pursuant to Section 7.5(e)(i) and Section
7.5(e)(ii) above, if any, be insufficient to satisfy the amount owed to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Section 7.5, then the Entitled
Holders' Agent shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the date such
Damages became payable, pay to such Indemnified Party such remaining amount
owed to such Indemnified Party from the Entitled Holders' Agent Expense Fund;

 

(iv)Lastly, should recovery pursuant to Section 7.5(e)(i), Section 7.5(e)(ii)
and Section 7.5(e)(iii) above, if any, be insufficient to satisfy the
remaining amount owed to an Indemnified Party in accordance with this Section
7.5, then each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date such Damages became payable, pay to such Indemnified Party
such Indemnifying Party's Proportionate Share of such remaining amount owed to
such Indemnified Party.

   

Section 7.6Defense of Third-Party Claims

 



 

(a)Promptly after Buyer or the Surviving Corporation receives notice of any
actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third
party against any Indemnified Parties and that may give rise to an
indemnification claim by any Indemnified Parties under this Article VII (any
such actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding by a third-party being referred to as a
"Third-Party Claim"), Buyer shall deliver to the Entitled Holders' Agent a
written notice stating the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim and the
dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known. The failure to
give prompt written notice will not affect any Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification under this Article VII, except to the extent the Entitled
Holders' Agent, on behalf of the Entitled Holders, has been prejudiced as a
result of such failure. 

 

(b)The Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume control of the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to
Entitled Holders' Agent. The Indemnified Party will have the right to settle,
compromise or defend such claim, provided that in conducting such defense,
settlement and compromise: (i) the Indemnified Party will cause its counsel
to consult with the Entitled Holders' Agent (or, in the event indemnification
is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such
Indemnifying Party) and, if applicable, its counsel, and keep them fully
advised of the progress of the defense, settlement and compromise, and (ii)
subject to Section 7.6(c), any settlement shall require the consent of the
Entitled Holders' Agent (or the applicable Indemnifying Party), which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

 

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may pay or settle any
claim (other than a Specified Claim) at any time without the consent of the
Entitled Holders' Agent (or the applicable Indemnifying Party), provided that
the Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to recover the reasonable amount
of settlement for any such settlements, and provided further that such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Party,
the Entitled Holders' Agent and the Indemnifying Parties from all liability on
claims that are the subject matter of such Third-Party Claim and (ii) does not
include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, the Entitled Holders' Agent or any
Indemnifying Parties.

 

(d)The Entitled Holders' Agent (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party)
will be entitled to participate in the defense, settlement and compromise of a
Third-Party Claim, and such Indemnified Party will cause its counsel to
consult with the Entitled Holders' Agent's (or applicable Indemnifying
Party's) and, if applicable, its counsel, and keep them fully advised of the
progress of the defense, settlement and compromise, and the Entitled Holders'
Agent's (or applicable Indemnifying Party's) will be entitled to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such
employment will be at the Entitled Holders' Agent's (or applicable
Indemnifying Party's) own expense, other than as set forth in Section 7.6(f).

   

(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of any written
communication after the date hereof from a third party of any actual or
possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or
proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by such third party
against any Indemnified Party or any Seller Agent arising out of or relating
to Section 7.2(a)(ii) or Section 7.2(m), none of the Indemnified Parties, on
the one hand, or Seller Agents, on the other hand, shall initiate any
communication, solicit or otherwise engage with such third party concerning
any such matters without the mutual consent of Buyer and the Entitled Holders'
Agent. 

 

(f)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Third-Party Claim arising
out of or relating to Section 7.2(a)(ii) or Section 7.2(m) (a "Specified
Claim"), the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule 7.6(f) shall apply.

 

Section 7.7Setoff Against Earnout Consideration

 

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3, in the event any Earnout
Consideration would otherwise become payable following the time a Claim Notice
has been delivered pursuant to Section 7.5, such Earnout Consideration shall
be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of Damages set forth in such Claim
Notice (the "Setoff Amount"), and if the Setoff Amount is greater than such
Earnout Consideration, any Earnout Consideration that would otherwise become
due following such time shall also be reduced dollar-for-dollar until and to
the extent the aggregate Earnout Consideration that would have become due has
been reduced, in the aggregate, by an amount equal to the Setoff Amount. In
the event all Claims with respect to which Earnout Consideration was reduced
pursuant to this Section 7.7 are finally resolved for an amount in the
aggregate that is less than the total Setoff Amounts, then Buyer shall deposit
such difference (the "Setoff Repayment") with the Paying Agent and shall cause
the Paying Agent to promptly disburse the Setoff Repayment to the Entitled
Holders' Agent Expense Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate
amount that any Earnout Payment may be reduced pursuant to this Section 7.7
shall be limited to eighty percent (80%) of the amount of such Earnout
Payment, and any Setoff Amount remaining that is not otherwise recovered by
the Indemnified Parties shall be recoverable from subsequent Earnout Payments,
if any.

(a)The parties to this Agreement each acknowledge and agree that (a) all
communications between Dorsey and Whitney LLP, Shartsis Friese LLP or Artegis
Law Group (collectively, "Company Counsel"), on the one hand, and the Company
or any of its representatives, on the other hand, and (b) privileged work
product of Company Counsel, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), made or
produced before the consummation of the Closing in connection with this

Buyer as a result of such communication being an attorney-client privileged
communication or otherwise privileged in nature ("Relevant Privileged
Materials"), shall continue after the Closing to be attorney-client privileged
communications of the Surviving Corporation with Company Counsel or otherwise
privileged in nature, as applicable, and, in no event, shall any Entitled
Holder, the Entitled Holders' Agent, any of their respective Affiliates, or

otherwise jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other privilege
attaching to the Relevant Privileged Materials. Neither Buyer nor its
Affiliate (including the Surviving Corporation) shall seek to admit into
evidence any of the Relevant Privileged Materials in connection with any
dispute concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including in respect of any indemnification claims, between any Entitled
Holder or the Entitled Holders' Agent, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the other hand, by
any process on the grounds that the attorney-client privilege or other
privilege attaching to such Relevant Privileged Materials belongs to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the immediately preceding
sentence in this Section 8.2(a) shall not be applicable with respect to
Relevant Privileged Materials to the extent the same does not concern or
otherwise relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) this Section 8.2(a) shall not limit any claim for fraud by any
Person.

   

(b)Each party to this Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) at the
Closing the attorney-client relationship between Company Counsel and the
Company with respect to the negotiation and Closing of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents shall terminate and (ii) Company Counsel in the future
may represent the Entitled Holders' Agent and any of the Entitled Holders (and
any of their respective heirs, executors, administrators, Affiliates,
successors and assigns) (collectively, the "Seller Parties") in any matter,
including any dispute, negotiation, controversy, arbitration or litigation
which may arise between any Seller Party(ies) on the one hand, and Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (and any of their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns) (collectively, the "Buyer
Entities"), on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, even if such matters are directly adverse to
the Company and each of the other Buyer Entities, and each of the Company and
the other Buyer Entities hereby consents to such representation. Company
Counsel will not be required to notify the Company or any other Buyer Entity
of any such representation as it arises. In connection with any such
representation by Company Counsel of any one or more of the Seller Parties in
any matter in which the Buyer Entities are adverse, the Company and each other
Buyer Entity hereby waives any duty of confidentiality or attorney-client
privilege which may have arisen as a result of Company Counsel's
representation of the Company. The Company and each other Buyer Entity
understands that it is being asked now to waive future conflicts as described
above without specific knowledge as to the specifics of those conflicts
because the waiver pertains to future facts and events. This consent and
waiver is intended to be for the benefit of Company Counsel and effective in
all jurisdictions in which Company Counsel practices, and to extend to any
rights conferred on the Company or any other Buyer Entity by the professional
rules of conduct of any such jurisdiction and any other statute, rule,
decision or common law principle relating to conflicts of interest that may
otherwise be applicable.

causes beyond its reasonable control, specifically: war, terrorism, strikes,
natural disaster or acts of God. Any delay resulting directly from any of
said causes shall extend accordingly the time to perform or respond by the
length of the delay. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall in no event
