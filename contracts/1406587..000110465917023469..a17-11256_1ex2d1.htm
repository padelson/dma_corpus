") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is
required by the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DRULPA, and shall make
all other deliveries, filings or recordings required by the DGCL and the

interest in, to or under such assets in the Surviving Entity or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement.

limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.5 _General Partner and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The
general partner of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the general partner of the Surviving Entity immediately following the
Effective Time. The officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Entity until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly designated, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. It is the intent of the parties
that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger will be treated as a
taxable sale by the Company of all of the Companys assets to Parent in
exchange for the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes
as provided herein) provided for herein to be provided to the holders of
Company Common Stock and the assumption of all of the Companys other
liabilities, followed by a distribution of such consideration to the holders
of Company Common Stock in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or of any partnership interests
in Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not
including shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
payable to the holder thereof, equal to $14.25 (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of any Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein), to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.2,
without interest.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Partnership Interests_. All of the partnership
interests of Merger Sub that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged by virtue of the Merger
as an outstanding partnership interest of the Surviving Entity, and such
partnership interests shall continue to be owned by Parent.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as a treasury share and each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or Parent or by any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be
cancelled without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in
respect thereof.

 



 

(d) _Company Equity Awards_. As of the Effective Time, (i) each award made or
otherwise denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (an " _Equity Award_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Company Benefit Plans shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as
of the Effective Time and (ii) in exchange for the cancellation of such Equity
Award, the holder of such Equity Award shall receive the Merger Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Equity Award (plus
payment of cash of all accrued dividend equivalents, if any, with respect to
such Equity Awards and, in the case of Equity Awards that are stock options or
stock appreciation rights, less the aggregate exercise or strike price
thereunder, but not less than $0), whether or not otherwise vested as of the
Effective Time (with such payment to be subject to any applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with Section 3.1(e)), provided that with respect to
any such Equity Awards that vest upon the achievement of performance-based
metrics, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Equity
Awards shall be determined pursuant to the terms set forth in the applicable
award agreements. The payments described in this Section 3.1(d) shall be made
upon the earliest date upon which such payments may be made without resulting

 



      
 

 



 

in the imposition of Taxes upon the recipient pursuant to the operation of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable
Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the " _Code_ "). The Company
and, as necessary, the Surviving Entity will take all actions necessary to
effect this Section 3.1(d).

 



 

(e) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Equity
Awards such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or
Equity Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall engage a nationally-
recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, cash equal to the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock. All cash
deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by
the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent will, or will cause Merger Sub (or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity) to, promptly deposit cash with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency required to fully
satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_
"), in each case, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a letter of
transmittal (which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (1)
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto or (2) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

receive in exchange the Merger Consideration (less applicable withholding
Taxes) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1, and any
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of
the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (I) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(II) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein), without interest,
upon such surrender.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article III.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article
III shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment
of their claim for the Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall remain jointly and severally liable for, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Entity, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Paying Agent or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after
the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former
stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article
III. Any interest and other income resulting from such

 



      
 

 



 

investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article III shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein) as
may be required pursuant to Section 3.1(a); provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an
agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent against
any claim that may be made against Parent or the Paying Agent in respect of
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III, and holders of
such Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect
or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock
will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals
of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

of its properties requires it to be so qualified, licensed or in good

binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to
or affecting creditors generally or by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in

or (c) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse

 



       
 

 



 

of time or both would become a default) under, give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result in the
triggering of any payment or other obligation or any right of consent, or

or by which the Company or any property or asset of the Company is bound or
affected (including any Material Contract and any Company Permit), except, in
the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for any such conflicts, violations,

Effect.

Company of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company and the performance by
the Company of this Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, order,

(ii) state securities or "blue sky" Laws, (iii) the DGCL to file the
Certificate of Merger or other appropriate documentation and (iv) the NYSE and
(b) such Consents, the failure of which to obtain, would not individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Letter.

each Joint Venture is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its respective organization except where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of the Company, each Joint Venture has the requisite corporate or
other applicable power and authority to carry on its respective business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective
properties and assets, except where the failure to have such power and
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of the Company, each Joint Venture is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each Joint Venture (i) have been duly authorized and validly issued

rights and (ii) except as set forth in Section 4.6(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company (and with
respect to each Joint Venture, to the extent of the Companys interest
therein), free and clear of all Liens and free of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock or other equity or voting interest) that would prevent the
operation by the Surviving Entity of such Subsidiarys or Joint Ventures
business in substantially the same manner as such businesses are presently
conducted. There are no options, warrants, convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable securities, subscriptions, stock appreciation rights, phantom
stock rights or stock equivalents or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments (contingent or otherwise) of any character issued or authorized by
any Subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company and except
as set forth in any Joint Venture Organizational Document, any Joint Venture
(i) relating to any issued or unissued capital stock or other equity interest
or voting securities of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) obligating any
Subsidiary of the Company or Joint Venture to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold, any shares of capital stock of, or options,
warrants, convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities, subscriptions
or other equity interests or voting securities in any Subsidiary of the
Company or Joint Venture, as applicable or (iii) that give any Person the
right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the
economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of capital stock of any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Joint Venture.

 



 

(d) The Company has made available to Parent copies of the articles of
incorporation, by-laws, shareholders agreement, limited liability company
agreement or similar organizational or governing document of each Subsidiary
of the Company and each Joint Venture.

 



 

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements and documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2014 (the " _Company

applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in
effect on the date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended, restated
or corrected by a subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of the
Agreement. None of the Company SEC Reports (excluding any financial statements
or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when
filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Report.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement, all
of the financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports, in each case,
including any related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed with
the SEC are collectively referred to as the " _Company Financial Statements_
"), comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules of the SEC with respect thereto and have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC, as applicable, and subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and to normal, recurring year-
end audit adjustments which were not material). The consolidated balance
sheets (including the related notes) included in such Company Financial
Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows (in each case,
including the related notes) included in such Company Financial Statements (if
applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent Company
SEC Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company
for the periods indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements,
to the absence of notes and to normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments
which were not material.

 



 

(c) With respect to the Company SEC Reports, each of the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company (or each former
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) have made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC or the NYSE, and the
statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is reasonably designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes.

 



 

(e) Based solely on the Companys managements most recently completed
evaluation of Companys internal control over financial reporting, the
Companys auditors (to the knowledge of the Company) and the Company Board
have not been advised of and the Company has not identified any "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls and procedures which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, in each case which has not been subsequently
remediated.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and

basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Companys filings
with the SEC and other public disclosure documents.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any joint venture, off
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys audited financial
statements or other Company SEC Reports.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2014 through the date hereof, none of the Company, its

significant role in financial reporting or the internal controls over

withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitment is in full force and effect. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Equity
Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitment. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto,
under the Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, Parent reasonably
believes that it will be able to satisfy the conditions to the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment and that the Equity
Financing will be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent will
provide to the Company any amendments to the Financing Commitment, or any
notices given in connection therewith, or any termination thereof, as promptly
as possible (but in any event within 24 hours following such amendment or
termination or receipt of such notices).

 



 

Section 5.7 _Merger Sub s Operations_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and has not owned any assets, engaged in any business activities or
conducted any operations, and will not at any time prior to the Effective Time
own any assets, engage in any business activities or conduct any operations,
in each case, other than in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Section 203 Matters_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at
any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested stockholder"
as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated by this
Agreement).

 



 

Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company in Article IV that relate to the subject matter of
clauses (i) - (iii) of this Section 5.9 (including Section 4.7), after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including
payment of all

 



      
 

 



 

amounts payable under Article I and Article III in connection with or as a
result of the Merger) and the payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
will be Solvent as of the Closing Date immediately after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, shall mean that, as
of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of
the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the sum of the
value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such Person as computed in
accordance with applicable Law as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will be
able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" mean that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due. Parent is not entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Disclosure Documents_. The information with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries that Parent or Merger Sub furnishes, or causes to be
furnished, to the Company in writing specifically for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will not, at the time of the mailing thereof or at the time the
Company Stockholders Meeting is to be held, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Compliance with Laws and Orders_. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with all Laws and Orders
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property,
business or asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected
and has not been given written notice of any violation of any such Laws or
Orders, except for failures to comply with or violation of such Laws or Orders
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to Company a guarantee (the " _Guarantee_ ") executed by
SOF-X U.S. Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the " _Guarantor_
"), in favor of Company with respect to certain obligations of the Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement. The Guarantee is in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors
generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). No event
has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee.

 



 

Section 5.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Article
V, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets,
operations, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaims any such other representations
or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer,
except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in
this Article V, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person makes or has
made any representation or warranty to the Company or any of its
Representatives, with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or operations or (ii) any oral or
written information furnished or made available to the Company or any of its
Representatives in the course of its due diligence investigation of Parent,
the negotiation of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including the accuracy, completeness
or currency thereof, and neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person will
have any liability to the Company or any other Person in respect of such
information, including any subsequent use of such information, except in the
case of fraud. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the Company nor any other Person has made or is making any representations or
warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly made by the
Company in Article IV, including any implied representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company
furnished or made available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives.

communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the

Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
substantive written or oral communication with any such Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) not participate in any substantive meeting or have any
substantive communication with any such Governmental Entity with respect to

has given the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other the opportunity
to attend and participate therein and (iv) furnish the other with copies of
all filings and communications between it and any such Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concern.

will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could be expected to limit the
right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of
their respective businesses or assets, including those of the Company. With
regard to any Governmental Entity, neither the Company nor any of its
respective affiliates shall, without Parents written consent, in Parents

take any action that limits Parents freedom of action with respect to, or
Parents ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of,
the Company or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement; provided
that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any such
action unless such action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third
Person and its Representatives concerning any Acquisition Proposal or
discussion that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, cease providing any
further information with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
Acquisition Proposal to any such Third Person or its Representatives,
terminate access for any such Third Persons and their Representatives to any
physical or electronic data room, and request that any such Third Person and
its Representatives in possession of confidential information about the
Company or its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company
to such Persons in connection with such activities, discussions or
negotiations return or destroy all such information in accordance with any
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement between the Company and such
Third Person. From and after the date of this Agreement, except as expressly
permitted by this Section 6.5, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not (and
the Company shall direct its and their respective Representatives not to),
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, request, initiate or knowingly facilitate
or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing information) any
proposal, offer or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, or take any other action to facilitate or
initiate the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish or make
available any information, or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any
Third Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal,
offer or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) amend or grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless the Company Board
after considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company that the
failure to waive or release or fail to enforce such provision would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws
of the State of Delaware, (iv) approve any Third Person becoming an
"interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL, (v) enter into any
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, term
sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.5(b)(iii)) (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (vi) propose publicly to do any of the
foregoing. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.5 or
clarifying the terms and conditions thereof. It is understood that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.5 by
any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective Representatives shall
be deemed a breach of this Section 6.5 by the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives may participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding, and furnish or disclose information (including non-public
information) in response to, an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal which was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result
from any breach of this Section 6.5 that is submitted to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives; provided that (i)
the Company Board determines in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iii)
prior to participating in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or
disclosing any non-public information to, a Third Person with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Third Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms not less favorable to the Company
than the terms then applicable under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv)
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after furnishing or making
available any non-public information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any such Third Person, the Company furnishes or makes
available such information to Parent or its Representatives (to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished or made available by the
Company to Parent or its Representatives).

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent in writing promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any _bona fide_
written indication that a Third Person intends to make an Acquisition Proposal
or any written request for information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case by any Third Person that intends to make
an Acquisition Proposal in connection therewith. The Company shall identify
the Third Person making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any material changes
thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto),
and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide
to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any
material oral communications addressing such matters).

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.5, the Company Board shall
not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, or propose publicly or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation (a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ ") (it being understood that the Company Board may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close
of business of the tenth Business Day following a written request by Parent to
the Company Board to affirm the Company Recommendation after the commencement
of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal
without such action

 



      
 

 



 

being considered an adverse modification), (ii) adopt, approve, authorize or
recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt,
approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take or fail to take any formal action or make or
fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) or (iv)
enter into any Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(e) If, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) to enter into a definitive, written
agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, if, and only if:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
effect a Change in Company Recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.5(e) or
to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive, written agreement
concerning a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), which notice
shall specify the basis for such Change in Company Recommendation or
termination and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, the
material terms and conditions thereof and all material documents relating to
such Acquisition Proposal; provided that in the event of any material
revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to
be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.5(e)
with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the "Notice
Period" in respect of such new written notice shall be two Business Days);

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change in Company
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal,
as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under this
Section 6.5;

 



 

(iii) after providing the notice contemplated by Section 6.5(e)(i), the
Company shall have discussed and negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to discuss and negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent Parent has requested that the Company discuss and
negotiate with Parent and its Representatives) during the Notice Period such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, as applicable; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) (A) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any proposed
changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on the last day of the Notice Period, and, taking into account
any such proposed changes, shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect and the failure to
take such action would continue to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and
(B) in the case of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Acquisition
Agreement concerning a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c), including paying
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(h).

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company Board,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) complying with
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;
provided that any such position taken or disclosed that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation
unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
statement or in connection with such Acquisition Proposal requiring compliance
with Rule 14e-2(a) no later than the ten business day deadline set forth in
Rule 14e-2(a) or (ii) making a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, an express rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company
or its Subsidiaries, the Company Board may effect a Change in Company
Recommendation (and the Company shall not be required to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement) in response to an Intervening Event if
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; provided, that, (i) the Company promptly notified Parent
in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action, of its
intention to do so, attaching a reasonably detailed description of the facts
relating to such Change in Company Recommendation, (ii) during such four
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (to the
extent that Parent has requested that the Company discuss and negotiate) with
Parent and its Representatives regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement in response to such potential Change in Company
Recommendation; and (iii) after such four Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering advice from its
outside legal counsel, and taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms of this Agreement made during such period, that the failure to take
such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its
directors and threatened

 



      
 

 



 

stockholder litigation of which the Company has knowledge, in each case
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby
and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such stockholder
litigation. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be
made by the Company in connection with any such stockholder litigation (and
the Company will in good faith take such comments into account), the
opportunity to consult on any settlement, understanding or other agreement
with respect to such stockholder litigation; provided, however that without
Parents prior written consent the Company shall only be permitted to offer to
make or make any payment with respect to any such stockholder litigation and
to enter into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to any
such stockholder litigation if the terms thereof, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable to the Company than those described in Section 6.6 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each such director
or officer an " _Indemnified Person_ "), in each case to the fullest extent a
Delaware corporation would be permitted by Law to indemnify such individuals,
including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date hereof that increase the
extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors, from
and against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys fees, expenses
and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any circumstances, developments or matters
in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, throughout this Section 6.7, for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery
and approval of this Agreement, the performance of the Companys obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
arising out of or pertaining to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and any other transaction considered by the Company in
lieu of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, at no expense to the beneficiaries, purchase as of the Effective Time a
tail endorsement to the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company which tail endorsement shall be effective
for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years
after the Closing Date (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time, and which Reporting Tail Endorsement shall contain coverage and amounts
at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the coverage currently
provided by Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
policies (in the aggregate); provided, that in no event shall the Surviving
Entity and Parent be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this
Section 6.7(b) that exceed 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the date of this
Agreement for such purpose, it being understood that if the

 



      
 

 



 

annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Entity and Parent, as applicable, shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount. Such Reporting Tail
Endorsement shall be placed through such broker(s) as may be specified by
Parent and as is reasonably acceptable to the Company. Notwithstanding the
first and second sentences of this Section 6.7(b), the Company shall be
permitted at its sole and exclusive option to purchase the Reporting Tail
Endorsement (in lieu of the Surviving Entity) prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the proviso of the first sentence of this Section 6.7(b).

 



 

(c) The limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Entity shall include
provisions for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and
exculpation of the Indemnified Persons and employees of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries on the same basis as set forth in the Company Organizational
Documents in effect on the date hereof with such changes as may be reasonably
necessary as a result of the Surviving Entitys organization as a limited
partnership and which will not adversely impact the Indemnified Persons or
employees rights to indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses or exculpation in any material respects. Following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, maintain in effect such provisions in its limited partnership agreement
providing for such indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses
and exculpation of Indemnified Persons and employees, as applicable, with
respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, in the case of the Indemnified Persons, to the fullest extent permitted
from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended
except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation
provisions of the agreements listed in Section 6.7(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any
of the Indemnified Persons or employees, or any such provisions contained in
the Surviving Entitys organizational documents to the extent such provisions
apply to Indemnified Persons or employees.

 



 

(e) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.7(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify Parent and the Surviving Entity thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Entity of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Person to the extent such failure does not
materially prejudice the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), as of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof through counsel (i) with
recognized competence and experience in connection with claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or investigations of the type involved, and (ii) reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Persons, and neither Parent nor the Surviving
Entity shall be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expense subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Persons in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Entity elects not to assume such defense or counsel or the
Indemnified Persons advise that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Persons or
between the Indemnified Persons, the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor
are received; provided, however, pursuant to this Section 6.7(e), (x) the
Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (y)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and provided, further, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner
contemplated by Section 6.7(a) is prohibited by applicable Law. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in respect of which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnified Person hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Entity may not replace
any counsel engaged by any Indemnified Person prior to the Effective Time
without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Persons or employee on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final and non-appealable
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(g) The covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.7 are intended to
be for the irrevocable benefit of and to grant third-party rights to, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons or employees and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person or employee is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this Section 6.7 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Person or employee unless the affected Indemnified Person or
employee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification.
It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified Person and or employee shall be a
third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.7, and entitled to enforce the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.7. If any Indemnified
Person or employee makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses under this Section 6.7 that is denied by Parent and/or the Surviving
Entity, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified
Person or employee is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified Persons or employees costs and
expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with
pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Entity. The rights of
the Indemnified Persons and employees under this Section 6.7 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Persons
or employees may have under the Company Organizational Documents, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Entity or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws
and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor and perform
under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause proper provision
to be made prior to consummation of any transaction of the type described in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence so that the successors or assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other Indemnified Person, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.7 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a
joint press release and thereafter, during the period between the date hereof
and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1, the Company and Parent each shall obtain the
prior consent of the other prior to issuing any press releases or making other
public statements and communications with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE. In
addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in the Proxy
Statement in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor the Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or disclosure concerning the other Party or the other Partys
business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of
the other Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.8 shall not apply to any release or
public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company in accordance with
Section 6.5 or in connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, honor all employment agreements and
Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

 



 

(b) Parent shall provide each Company Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the twelve month period following the Effective Time with
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
described in Section 6.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9, express or implied, will: (i) be
construed to establish, amend, terminate or modify any Company Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy,
Contract, or arrangement; (ii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any Person (including any Company Employee, other employee of
the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
their respective beneficiaries), including with respect to any right to
employment or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of
employment; (iii) obligate Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Entity or any of their Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, Contract, or arrangement or (B)
hire or retain the employment or any particular Company Employee for any
period following the Closing Date or limit the ability of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee
(including a Company Employee) following the Effective Time at any time and
for any or no reason; or (iv) alter or limit the ability of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
policy, Contract or arrangement at any time following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.11 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover Law becomes
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Convertible Notes Supplemental Indenture_. The Company shall
take all actions as and when reasonably necessary to satisfy the Companys
obligations under the Indenture, dated as of February 26, 2013, between the

including entering into a supplemental indenture in accordance with Section
4.07(a) of such First Supplemental Indenture.

 



 

Section 6.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Closing, and nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.14 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
others in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in any event no more than 40 days following the date of this Agreement),

respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or requests for additional
information from the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing
any other document to be filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (A) cooperate and
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document
or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response) and related correspondence and filings, (B) consider in good faith
and include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and (C) promptly (and in no event later than the fifth
Business Day following the date of this Agreement) initiate a "broker search"
in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) The Company (i) shall cause the Proxy Statement and any amendments or
supplements thereto, when filed, to comply as to form, with all material legal
requirements applicable thereto and (ii) agrees that none of the information
to be included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any

 



       
 

 



 

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made
by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein to the extent based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein. Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the
information to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any
Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement shall, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; provided,
however, that no representation or warranty is made by either Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein to
the extent based on information supplied by the Company or any Affiliate of
the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



 

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto,
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement and in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company.
Nothing in this Section 6.16(d) shall limit the obligations of any Party under
Section 6.16(a) or 6.16(b).

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. As soon as reasonably
practicable, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for the Company Stockholders
Meeting to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at
the Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting.
The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders
that they provide the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have made a Change in Company Recommendation as
permitted by Section 6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.16(d), (i) if, on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of the Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies
and votes in favor of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, which postponements or adjournments shall be for the minimum time, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, as is necessary to obtain such
additional proxies and votes required to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval and (ii) the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure if the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law and then only for the minimum time as the Company Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
reasonably necessary to give the holders of Company Common Stock the required
time to evaluate any applicable information or disclosure; provided, further,
that the Company shall, if requested by Parent, delay, adjourn or postpone
convening the Company Stockholders Meeting (x) for the absence of a quorum or
(y) for up to 10 Business Days to allow additional time to solicit additional
proxies if necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.

Debt Financing, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of

expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Existing
Indebtedness or any Joint Venture Organizational Documents (provided, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall seek the consent of the parties to any
such contracts governing Existing Indebtedness or any Joint Venture
Organizational Documents as requested by Parent) or (b) unreasonably and

necessary to facilitate the redemption and/or satisfaction and discharge of
such series pursuant to the applicable section of the indenture applicable
thereto, and shall redeem and/or satisfy and discharge, as applicable, the
Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the indenture applicable thereto at

Senior Secured Notes and any opinion of counsel requirement to be delivered
after the Closing shall be delivered by Parent.

thereto and applicable securities Laws, (ii) any supplemental indentures in
accordance herewith shall become operative only concurrently with the Closing;
and (iii) the Company shall not be obligated to enter into any supplemental

Section 6.19 _Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
upon Parents written request at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing

that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as set
forth in Section 6.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter (each such subsidiary
identified in such written request, a " _Converted Entity_ ") to (i) convert
into, at Parents election, a limited liability company or limited partnership
(or other entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the Company
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (a " _Disregarded Entity_ "), (ii) merge
with and into a Disregarded Entity, and/or (iii) make an election under
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) to be disregarded as an entity

the Effective Time) (as determined by the Company in its reasonable
discretion), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each such Converted Entity
is a Disregarded Entity; provided that (A) the Company shall not be required
to take any such action that would reasonably be expected to result in the
failure of, or materially delay the satisfaction of, any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII and (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any such actions unless such actions are conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing; and provided, further, that the Company and its

action by Parent, Parent provides written notice to the Company of its
withdrawal of such

 



      
 

 



 

direction. In all cases for purposes of this Section 6.19, subject to the
first proviso in the first sentence of this Section 6.19, the determination of
the type of Disregarded Entity (e.g., limited partnership, limited liability
company, etc.) shall be at the direction of Parent. In the event the Closing
does not occur, Parent shall reimburse the Company for all filing fees and
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses to the extent
relating to the actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.19. Parent hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a result of taking such
actions (including any tax consequences). Without limiting the foregoing, none
of the representations and warranties of the Company or the covenants set
forth in Section 6.1 shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or
violated by, any of the actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.19.

shall only make

 



      
 

 



 

such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any material and
publicly proposed or disclosed amendment thereto).

 



 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1
(other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Party.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated

terminate, and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party with
respect thereto, except that (i) the provisions of this Section 8.2 and
Article IX shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability or damages for fraud or for any
willful and material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement prior to the date of termination.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in this Section 8.2, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

(iii) (A) Section 8.1(b)(i) (but only if at such time Parent would not be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement by the proviso in Section
8.1(b)(i)) or Section 8.1(b)(iii) by the Company or Parent or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), (B) there has been publicly disclosed or
publicly proposed prior to the date of termination of this Agreement an
Acquisition Proposal that remains outstanding and not withdrawn as of the date
of termination of this Agreement and (C) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries consummates or enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that,
solely for the purposes of this Section 8.2(c)(iii), references to "15%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%", then the Company shall pay, without duplication, to Parent concurrently
with the consummation of such transaction or entry into such definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal the Company Termination
Fee by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by
Parent.

 



 

As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal

(e) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that the provisions
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, that the damages resulting from the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and that the amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.2 are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be
incurred by Parent under such circumstances. The amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 8.2 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Section 9.13, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (i)
Parents right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.2 (plus any costs, expenses or interest payable in connection
therewith pursuant to Section 8.2(h)) in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable, shall constitute the only monetary damages
of (A) Parent and Merger Sub and (B) the former, current and future holders of
any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, financing sources, Affiliates (other than Parent and Merger Sub),
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of
each of Parent and Merger Sub (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and other
Representatives (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") and none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company
in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is entitled
to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2, any such
amounts payable as the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2
shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company
to Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Company for any losses, damages, costs or expenses
of the Parent or Merger Sub relating to the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, or a breach of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by the Company or otherwise, shall be limited to $30,000,000 (the "
_Company Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Company Liability
Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the Merger or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, other
than in the case of fraud. Without limiting the rights of Parent and Merger
Sub against the Company hereunder, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or
their Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Company
Related Party. In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person
acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to
seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company
Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no
event will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary
damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company
Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub together for any losses, damages,
costs or expenses of the Company relating to the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee (the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall
the Company or any of its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Parent
Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the Merger or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. The
Company agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal
liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Related Parties (other than
Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement), through Parent
or Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against any Parent
Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but
not any other Parent Related Party) under and to the extent provided in the
Guarantee and subject to the Parent Liability Limitation and the other
limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the
Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and their
respective Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Related Party
(other than Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement) in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law
or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights
of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the
Company or its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from,
any Parent Related Party

 



      
 

 



 

(other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and subject
to the Parent Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein).

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2, it is agreed
that Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.13.

 



 

(h) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by either Party (A) pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i) (provided that, at such time, the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(d) has not been satisfied and all conditions set forth in Section
7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied or waived other than those conditions
that are only capable of being satisfied or waived at Closing (but provided
that such conditions were so capable of being satisfied or waived)) or (B)
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for its actual and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000
(provided, in the case of clause (A), such amount is not to exceed $3,000,000)
(the " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the second Business Day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement; provided, that the existence of circumstances
which would require the Company Termination Fee (less any Parent Expense
Reimbursement previously paid to Parent by the Company) to become subsequently
payable by the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay
the Parent Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 8.2(i); and
provided, further, that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 8.2(h) shall not relieve the Company of
any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee (less any Parent
Expense Reimbursement previously paid to Parent by the Company). For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Parent Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion and (y) in no event
shall the sum of the Parent Expense Reimbursement and Company Termination Fee
payable by the Company exceed the amount of the Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(i) Any amounts not paid when due pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall bear
interest from the date such payment is due until the date paid at a rate equal
to the prime rate plus 200 basis points as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was due. If either Parent or the
Company fails to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.2 in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Party failing to pay such amounts shall pay the costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of the other Party
in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken by such other Party to collect payment that results in a
judgment against the Party for such amounts due under this Section 8.2.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Amendments_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
by written agreement of the Parties, at any time before or after receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time with respect
to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that after the
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the
consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of Company

 



      
 

 



 

without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. No amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, agreements,
obligations or other acts of any other Party or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of
any representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements,
covenants or conditions of any other Party or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _GENERAL PROVISIONS_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 9.1 shall not limit the survival of any covenant or agreement of
Parent or the Surviving Entity in this Agreement which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if delivered personally, sent via electronic mail (receipt confirmed),

Section 9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Exhibit, or Section of the Company Disclosure Letter, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or Section of
the Company Disclosure Letter to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,

 



      
 

 



 

including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
The term "or" is not exclusive. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic method), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Letter, and the exhibits hereto, together
with the other instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b)
except for (i) following the Effective Time, the rights of the Companys
stockholders to receive the payments provided for herein and (ii) the
provisions of Section 6.7, is not intended to and shall not confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereby submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any
appellate courts thereof (the " _Delaware Courts_ "), for any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or validity
thereof (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise). Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such proceedings brought in the Delaware Courts. With respect to
any such proceeding, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court (a) that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for any reason
other than the failure to serve process in accordance with applicable Law, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of the Delaware
Courts or from any legal process commenced in the Delaware Courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in the Delaware Courts is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by the
Delaware Courts.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.9 _Headings, etc._ The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter
in the Company Disclosure Letter shall expressly not be deemed to constitute
an admission by the Company or Parent, respectively, or to otherwise imply,
that any such matter is material for the purpose of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the Parties. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable harm would occur and that Parent and Merger Sub would not have any
adequate remedy at Law (a) for any actual or threatened breach of the
provisions of this Agreement or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that, except where this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection
herewith, in each case, if the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived, and the Company further agrees to waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond or proving actual damages in
connection with such remedy. The Company hereby consents to the right of
Parent and Merger Sub to seek the issuance of such injunction or injunctions,
and to the grant of such injunction or injunctions. The Company further agrees
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.13, Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this
Agreement, including payment of the Company Termination Fee, other monetary
damages

 



      
 

 



 

or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.13 are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this
Section 9.13 shall require Parent or Merger Sub to institute any proceeding
for (or limit either such Partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.13 before exercising any termination
right under Section 8.1 (and pursuing the payment of the Company Termination
Fee or other monetary damages after such termination) nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 9.13 or anything contained
in this Section 9.13 restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1 or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. For
the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with this Section 9.13 and payment of the
Company Termination Fee or other monetary damages, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any such payment.
The Company further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide for an adequate
remedy. The Parties agree that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the Financing Commitment and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of the Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in Section 8.2(c); provided, however,
that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of Section 6.2.
