                                     - 18 -

All outstanding Common Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued, are
fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to, nor were they issued in
violation of, any pre-emptive rights, and all Common Shares issuable upon the
exercise of outstanding Leitch Options in accordance with their respective terms

paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to any pre-emptive rights. Other
than the Leitch Options and the Restricted Share Awards, there are no securities
of Leitch or of any subsidiary outstanding which have the right to vote
generally (or are exercisable, convertible into or exchangeable for securities
having the right to vote generally) with the Shareholders on any matter. Except
as set out in the Leitch Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual
or other obligations of Leitch or any subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or

         (f) Ownership of Subsidiaries. The Leitch Disclosure Letter includes a
list of (i) all subsidiaries of Leitch and the number and percentage of shares
(equity and voting) of each subsidiary owned, directly or indirectly, by Leitch
and (ii) all other investment interests of Leitch, including any minority (less

venture, coventurer or other similar interest or investment. Except as set forth
in the Leitch Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock
and other ownership interests in Leitch's subsidiaries are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such shares and other
ownership interests indicated as owned directly or indirectly by Leitch are
owned free and clear of all Liens, and there are no outstanding options, rights,
entitlements, understandings or commitments (contingent or otherwise) regarding
the right to acquire any such shares of capital stock or other ownership
interests in or material assets or properties of any of Leitch's subsidiaries.

         (g) Financial Statements; Reports. As of their respective dates or,
where no such date is specified, the date of filing with applicable securities
regulatory authorities: (i) Leitch's consolidated audited financial statements
as at and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2003, April 30, 2004, April 30,
2005 and the draft unaudited interim financial statements as at and for the
first quarter ended July 31, 2005 as provided to Harris on August 29, 2005
(collectively, the "LEITCH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"); (ii) Leitch's Annual
Information Form dated July 29, 2005 (including all documents incorporated by
reference therein); (iii) Leitch's Management Information Circular dated July
26, 2005 in respect of its 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders; (iv) all Leitch
material change reports, or similar documents filed with the Canadian Securities
Administrators since April 30, 2005; and (v) all prospectuses or other offering
documents used by Leitch in the offering of its securities or all reports filed
by Leitch with securities regulators pursuant to applicable securities Laws
(including periodic and other reports filed under the Exchange Act) since
September 1, 2003: (1) at their respective effective dates did not (or, in the
case of the interim financial statements referred to above, will not) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and (2)
complied (or, in the case of the interim financial statements referred to above,
will comply) with all applicable securities Laws except where any non-compliance
would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
Leitch. The Leitch Financial Statements, and all financial statements of Leitch
and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in such information
circulars forms, reports, statements, prospectuses


<PAGE>

                                     - 19 -



and other documents, were prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except (A) as otherwise indicated in such financial statements
and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited statements, in the related
report of Leitch's independent auditors, or (B) in the case of unaudited interim
statements, to the extent they may not include footnotes, are subject to normal
year end adjustments, or may be condensed or summary statements), and fairly
present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and changes
in financial position of Leitch and its subsidiaries, as of the dates thereof
and for the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and reduced note
disclosure) and reflect reserves required by Canadian GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis, in respect of contingent liabilities of Leitch and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Leitch is not currently aware of any
year-end adjustments that are expected to be material. There has been no change
in Leitch's accounting policies, except as described in the notes to the Leitch
Financial Statements, since April 30, 2005. Leitch owns a ten percent interest
in LC Limited, a Hong Kong joint venture. Leitch also has a relationship with
Leitch Italia S.R.L. ("LEITCH ITALIA"). Leitch has not consolidated the
financial statements of LC Limited or Leitch Italia with Leitch or disclosed
these entities as variable interest entities. If Leitch would have been required
to consolidate or disclose the financial position and results of operations of
LC Limited or Leitch Italia in any of the Leitch Financial Statements, such
consolidation or disclosure would not have materially adversely impacted
Leitch's financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as of the
dates and for the periods indicated in each of the Leitch Financial Statements.

         (h) Books and Records. The financial books, records and accounts of
Leitch and its subsidiaries in all material respects (i) have been maintained in
accordance with good business practices on a basis consistent with prior years,
(ii) are stated in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the
material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Leitch and its
subsidiaries and (iii) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the Leitch
Financial Statements. Leitch has devised and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (x)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements' general or specific
authorization; and (y) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP. Leitch's
and its subsidiaries' corporate records and minute books have been maintained
substantially in compliance with applicable Laws and are complete and accurate
in all material respects, and full access thereto has been provided to Harris,
except with respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (i) Litigation. Except as set out in the Leitch Disclosure Letter,
there is no investigation, inquiry, request for information, audit, charge,
claim, action, suit or other Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Leitch,
threatened, affecting Leitch or any of its subsidiaries or affecting any of the
property or assets of Leitch (including the Intellectual Property), or any of
its subsidiaries at law or in equity before or by any Governmental Entity which
investigation, inquiry, request for information, audit, charge, claim, action,
suit or other Proceeding (a) involves, or could reasonably involve or lead to a
judgement or claim against or potential liability of Leitch or its subsidiaries
which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Leitch or could prevent or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) sought or seeks injunctive
relief against Leitch or its subsidiaries as of the date hereof or which, as at
the Effective Time, has sought or is

seeking injunctive relief against Leitch or its subsidiaries which, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Leitch or could
prevent or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (c) is related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as of the date hereof or which, as at the Effective Time, is related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which, individually or in
the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on Leitch or could prevent
or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set out in the Leitch Disclosure Letter or as Publicly
Disclosed by Leitch, neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries or the
respective assets or properties of Leitch or any of its subsidiaries is subject
to any outstanding judgement, order, writ, injunction or decree that has had or
would have a Material Adverse Effect on Leitch or could prevent or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (j) Taxes.

         (i)      Leitch and each of its subsidiaries have timely filed (taking
                  into account any extension of time to file granted or
                  obtained), all material Tax Returns required to be filed by
                  them (all of which returns were correct and complete in all
                  material respects), have timely paid, all material Taxes due
                  (whether or not shown on any Tax Return), and have satisfied
                  in full in all respects all material Tax withholding, deposit
                  and remittance requirements imposed on or with respect to any
                  of Leitch and its subsidiaries, and the most recently
                  published financial statements of Leitch contain an adequate
                  provision in accordance with Canadian GAAP for all material
                  Taxes payable in respect of each period covered by such
                  financial statements and all prior periods to the extent such
                  material Taxes have not been paid, whether or not due and
                  whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns. Leitch
                  and each of its subsidiaries have made adequate provision in
                  accordance with Canadian GAAP in their books and records for
                  material Taxes accruing in respect of any accounting period
                  ending subsequent to the period covered by such financial
                  statements.

         (ii)     Neither Leitch nor any subsidiary of Leitch has received any
                  written notification that any material issue involving
                  material Taxes has been raised (and is currently pending) by
                  the Canada Revenue Agency, the United States Internal Revenue
                  Service or any other taxing authority, including, without
                  limitation, any sales tax authority, in connection with any of
                  the material Tax Returns filed or required to be filed, and no
                  waivers of statutes of limitations or objections to any
                  assessments or reassessments involving material Taxes have
                  been given, filed or requested with respect to Leitch or any
                  subsidiary of Leitch. All material liability of Leitch and its
                  subsidiaries for Canadian federal and provincial income and
                  capital taxes has been assessed by the Canada Revenue Agency
                  and, where applicable, Canadian provincial tax authorities for
                  all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended
                  April 30, 2005. Neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries has
                  received any notice from any taxing authority to the effect
                  that any material Tax Return is being examined or of any Tax
                  audit or other material Tax issue. No deficiency for
                  additional material Taxes has been proposed against Leitch or
                  any of its subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Leitch, no claim
                  has ever been made in




<PAGE>

                                     - 21 -

                  writing by any Tax authority in a jurisdiction where neither
                  Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries files material Tax Returns
                  that Leitch or any of its subsidiaries is or may be subject to
                  taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no material Tax Liens
                  on any assets of Leitch or any of its subsidiaries except for
                  Taxes not yet due and payable and Taxes being contested in
                  good faith. Neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries has
                  received a refund of any material Taxes to which it was not
                  entitled. Except for the employment agreements between Leitch
                  and each of Timothy Thorsteinson dated November 17, 2003, Jim
                  Sakaguchi dated May 25, 2004 and February 21, 2005, Robert
                  Schonbeck dated January 4, 2005 and Simon Gatt dated April 20,
                  2004 updated in June 2005, copies of which have been provided
                  to Harris, neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries is a
                  party to any Tax sharing, allocation or other similar
                  agreement or arrangement or any Tax indemnification agreement
                  of any nature with any other Person (other than among Leitch
                  and any of its subsidiaries) pursuant to which Leitch or any
                  of its subsidiaries has or could have, individually or in the
                  aggregate, any material liability in respect of Taxes.

         (iii)    The Leitch Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of estimated
                  Tax loss carry-forwards prepared for financial statement
                  purposes as of April 30, 2005 of Leitch and its subsidiaries,
                  organized by entity subject to filing of relevant Tax Returns
                  and audit adjustments or reassessments by the relevant taxing
                  authority.

         (k) Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as Publicly Disclosed by
Leitch in the Leitch Financial Statements as at and for the year ended April 30,
2005, neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries has any material obligations or
liabilities of any nature, whether or not matured or unmatured, accrued, fixed,
contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be disclosed in a
balance sheet or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Leitch.

         (l) Absence of Change; No Material Adverse Effect. Except as Publicly
Disclosed by Leitch, since April 30, 2005, there has not been any Material
Adverse Effect on Leitch. Since April 30, 2005, the Business has been conducted

                  or any subsidiary except in compliance with Environmental Law.
                  In addition, neither the owned real property or leased real
                  property nor, to the knowledge of Leitch, any location
                  formerly owned, operated or leased by Leitch or any subsidiary
                  is the subject of any enforcement actions or other
                  investigations by a Governmental Entity or other third party
                  that would reasonably be expected to lead to Environmental
                  Liability for Leitch or any subsidiary. No underground storage
                  tanks containing Hazardous Materials are, or to the knowledge
                  of Leitch, have been, located on any property or facility

                  the transportation of Hazardous Materials, or at which any
                  Hazardous Materials for which Leitch or any subsidiary would
                  reasonably be expected to have Environmental Liability have
                  been deposited, disposed or otherwise placed. In addition, to
                  the knowledge of Leitch, no such off-site location is the
                  subject of any enforcement actions or other investigations by
                  any Governmental Entity or other third party that would
                  reasonably be expected to lead to Environmental Liability for
                  Leitch or any subsidiary.

         (v)      Neither Leitch nor any subsidiary has within the past three
                  years received any written request for information, notice,
                  demand letter, administrative inquiry, or compliance notice,
                  or notice of claim or other inquiry from a Governmental Entity
                  or third party with respect to the presence of Contamination

                  Contamination or threatened Contamination present at or
                  migrating from any off-site location or locations to which
                  Leitch or any subsidiary transported or arranged for
                  transportation of any Hazardous Material or Hazardous
                  Material-containing substance generated by Leitch or any
                  subsidiary.

                  not in compliance with Environmental Law or has or is subject
                  to an Environmental Liability.

         (viii)   Neither Leitch nor any subsidiary has entered into or agreed
                  to any order or is subject to any judgement requiring

                  cleanup of Contamination or threatened Contamination.

         (ix)     Neither Leitch nor any subsidiary is aware of any changes or
                  proposed changes to the terms of any Environmental Permits or
                  any review by any Governmental Entity of such Environmental
                  Permits.

         (x)      Leitch has made available to Harris copies of all material
                  environmental audits, evaluations, assessments, studies and
                  reports dealing with environmental matters for Leitch and any
                  subsidiary or affiliate, and that are in the possession or
                  control of Leitch or any subsidiary.

This Section (m) contains all the representations and warranties in this
Agreement with respect to environmental matters, and no other representations
and warranties shall be construed as applicable to the subject matter covered
herein.

         (n) Owned Real Property; Assets. The Leitch Disclosure Letter sets out
a list of all owned real property interests of Leitch or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates. Except as set forth in the Leitch Disclosure Letter, Leitch
and/or each of its subsidiaries has good, marketable, valid and insurable title
in fee simple to its owned real property interests, free and clear of all
material Liens, including mortgages, other than (i) easements and zoning
restrictions which do not materially interfere with the use of such owned real
property interests in the operation of the Business, and (ii) Liens incurred not
in connection with the borrowing of money which do not and would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the occupancy, use or value of the affected assets. Leitch and its
subsidiaries are the beneficial owners of, and have title to, all the material
assets owned by Leitch and its subsidiaries which are used in connection with
their respective businesses.

         (o) Leased Real Property. The Leitch Disclosure Letter lists each real
property lease to which Leitch or one of its subsidiaries is a party (a
"LEASE"). Each material Lease has been validly executed and delivered by the
tenant and is unmodified except as set forth in the Leitch Disclosure Letter and
is in full force and effect. Each material Lease represents the entire agreement
between the landlord and the tenant in respect of the leased premises and the
tenant has no charge, Lien or right of set-off in respect of, or credit or right
to a credit in respect of, the rents payable thereunder. With respect to each
material Lease, Leitch or its subsidiary has taken possession of the leased
premises and all material improvements to the leased premises that are the
landlord's responsibility have been completed. Leitch is not in default of any
of its material obligations under any material Lease and there is no outstanding
material dispute between Leitch and the landlord in respect of any material
Lease. There are no material unpaid allowances, incentives, inducements or other
moneys or benefits (including free rent) owing or which may become owing by the
landlord to Leitch at any time under the Lease.

         (p) Licences. Leitch and each of its subsidiaries has obtained and is
in compliance with all licences, permits, certificates, consents, orders, grants
and other authorizations of or from any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct
its current businesses as they are now being or are proposed to be conducted,
other than such licences, permits, certificates, consents, orders, grants and
authorizations the absence of which would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Effect on Leitch.

         (q) Intellectual Property.

                  Other than such Intellectual Property, the unavailability of
                  which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Leitch, and
                  except as disclosed in the Leitch Disclosure Letter:



<PAGE>


                                     - 24 -



         (i)      The Leitch Intellectual Property and the Licensed Intellectual
                  Property are together sufficient to permit the Business to be
                  carried on immediately after the Effective Date in
                  substantially the same manner as it was conducted by Leitch
                  and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Date.

         (ii)     The Leitch Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate
                  list of all the registrations of, and applications for
                  registration of, the Leitch Intellectual Property. All of the
                  registrations and applications for registration of the Leitch
                  Intellectual Property are valid and subsisting in good
                  standing and are recorded in the name of Leitch or its
                  subsidiaries as applicable. No Person has challenged the
                  validity of any registrations for the Leitch Intellectual
                  Property or the ownership by Leitch or any of its subsidiaries
                  of any of the Leitch Intellectual Property. Neither the
                  current or past use of the Leitch Intellectual Property or the
                  Licensed Intellectual Property by Leitch or its subsidiaries
                  nor the conduct of the Business has infringed or currently
                  infringes or has been alleged to infringe upon the industrial
                  or intellectual property rights of any other Person, except
                  for claims or allegations of infringement that have been
                  settled or are no longer being actively pursued. No
                  application for registration of any Leitch Intellectual
                  Property has received a final rejection.

         (iii)    Leitch and its subsidiaries own all right, title and interest
                  in and to the Leitch Intellectual Property. Leitch or its
                  subsidiaries are licensed or possess legally enforceable
                  rights to use the Licensed Intellectual Property. Neither the
                  Leitch Intellectual Property nor the Licensed Intellectual
                  Property is subject to any Lien, option, right of first
                  refusal or offer or security interest of any kind. None of the
                  material Leitch Intellectual Property is jointly owned by
                  Leitch with any third party.

         (iv)     The Leitch Intellectual Property and the conduct of the
                  Business have not and do not infringe, misappropriate or
                  otherwise violate any intellectual or industrial property
                  rights of any other Person, and, to the knowledge of Leitch,
                  no other Person or intellectual or industrial property owned
                  by any other Person has infringed, misappropriated or
                  otherwise conflicted with or harmed any of the Leitch
                  Intellectual Property or the right and interest of Leitch or
                  its subsidiaries in the Licensed Intellectual Property.

         (v)      Leitch and its subsidiaries have taken all commercially
                  reasonable steps to protect their respective ownership rights
                  in the Leitch Intellectual Property. Leitch and its
                  subsidiaries have maintained the confidentiality of all trade
                  secrets and confidential information except for such
                  disclosure to other Persons as may have been made in the
                  Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with standard
                  practices ordinarily followed by manufacturers of broadcasting
                  equipment.

         (vi)     Leitch and its subsidiaries have taken all commercially
                  reasonable steps to obtain the ownership of all Leitch
                  Intellectual Property created or modified by its employees and
                  consultants, and all authors of any material Leitch
                  Intellectual Property and all persons, including all employees
                  and consultants of Leitch and its






<PAGE>

                                     - 25 -


                  subsidiaries, involved in the development of material Leitch
                  Intellectual Property have assigned their intellectual
                  property rights thereto to Leitch and its subsidiaries, as
                  applicable, and have waived all moral rights that they may
                  have therein

         (vii)    Leitch and its subsidiaries have all permissions and licenses
                  necessary to use the Licensed Intellectual Property and no
                  additional consent, permission or license from any Person is
                  required to use the Licensed Intellectual Property, other than
                  normal course renewals.

         (viii)   Except in the Ordinary Course of Business, Leitch and its
                  subsidiaries have not permitted or licensed any Person to use
                  any of the Leitch Intellectual Property.

         (ix)     To the knowledge of Leitch, no Material Contract, or any
                  material part thereof, to which Leitch or one of its
                  subsidiaries is a party and that relates to the Leitch
                  Intellectual Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property is
                  unenforceable, and neither Leitch nor any of its subsidiaries
                  is in breach of any such Material Contract or has repudiated
                  such Material Contract. Neither Leitch nor any of its
                  subsidiaries, has given notice of an intention to terminate,
                  cancel, fail to renew or change the terms of such Material
                  Contract.

         (r) Technology.

         (i)      The hardware and software comprising any part of the
                  Technology is in good operating condition.

         (ii)     Other than copyright protection and license enforcement
                  restrictions included in the Ordinary Course of Business, to
                  the knowledge of Leitch no portion of the Technology contains
                  any disabling mechanism or protection feature designed to
                  prevent its use, computer virus, worm, software lock, drop
                  dead device, Trojan-horse routine, trap door, time bomb or any
                  other codes or instructions that may be used to access,
                  modify, delete, damage or disable any of the Technology or any
                  computer system on which any of the Technology is installed or
                  in connection with which it may operate.

         (s) Pension and Employee Benefits.

                  Other than the Executive Agreements:

         (i)      The Leitch Disclosure Letter sets out a complete and accurate
                  list of all written or oral employee benefit, welfare,
                  supplemental unemployment benefit, bonus, pension, retirement
                  income, profit sharing, executive compensation, change of
                  control benefit, current or deferred compensation, incentive
                  compensation, stock compensation, stock purchase, stock
                  option, stock appreciation, phantom stock option, savings,
                  severance or termination pay, retirement, supplementary
                  retirement, hospitalization insurance, salary continuation,
                  legal, health or other medical, dental, life, disability or
                  other insurance (whether insured or self-insured), and every
                  other written or oral benefit plan, program, agreement or




<PAGE>

                                     - 26 -

                  arrangement sponsored, maintained or contributed to or
                  required to be contributed to by Leitch or a subsidiary of
                  Leitch for the benefit of employees or former employees and
                  their dependants or beneficiaries which are currently
                  maintained or were maintained by Leitch or a subsidiary at any
                  time in the last five years or with respect to which Leitch or
                  a subsidiary participates in or has any actual or potential
                  liability or obligations (collectively, the "LEITCH PLANS").
                  The term "U.S. Plan" shall mean any Leitch Plan that is
                  maintained in the United States or that is otherwise subject
                  to the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act
                  of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the United States Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC") or any other Law of
                  the United States. With respect to any U.S. Plan or any
                  reference to ERISA or the IRC, under this SECTION 3.1(s),
                  references to "subsidiaries" shall include any trade or
                  business (whether or not incorporated) under common control
                  with the meaning of Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA with Leitch or
                  which together with Leitch is treated as a single employer
                  under Section 414(t) of the IRC. The Leitch Disclosure Letter
                  sets forth a complete list of the U.S. Plans.

         (ii)     Leitch has furnished or made available to Harris true,
                  correct, up-to-date and complete copies of all the Leitch
                  Plans, or where oral, written summaries of the most important
                  terms thereof, as amended together with all current and past
                  related documentation and all amendments thereto including
                  trust agreements, funding agreements, funding and financial
                  information returns and statements, copies of significant
                  correspondence with all regulatory authorities with respect to
                  each Leitch Plan and plan summaries, employee booklets and
                  personnel manuals. None of the Leitch Plans is a
                  multi-employer pension plan as defined under applicable Laws
                  including a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37)
                  of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the IRC or a "multiple employer
                  plan" within the meaning of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section
                  413(c) of the IRC. None of the Leitch Plans is a "defined
                  benefit plan" or contains a "defined benefit provision" or
                  provides "defined benefits" as defined or used in applicable
                  Laws including a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section
                  3(35) of ERISA, a pension plan subject to the funding
                  standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC.
                  None of the Leitch Plans requires the preparation of an
                  actuarial report in accordance with applicable Laws.

         (iii)    All of the Leitch Plans are and have been established,
                  registered, qualified, invested, funded and administered in
                  accordance in all material respects, with their terms, with
                  all applicable Laws, with the terms of any applicable
                  collective agreements and with the terms of agreements,
                  written or oral, between Leitch, a subsidiary or both, as the
                  case may be, and any other party. To the knowledge of Leitch,
                  no fact or circumstance exists that could reasonably be
                  expected to adversely affect the existing tax status of any of
                  the Leitch Plans. To the knowledge of Leitch, no event has
                  occurred respecting any Leitch Plan which would entitle any
                  Person to cause the wind-up or termination of such Leitch Plan
                  in whole or in part. No Taxes, penalties or fees are owing or
                  exigible under any of the Leitch Plans. Each U.S. Plan
                  intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC is so
                  qualified and has heretofore been determined by the United
                  States



<PAGE>

                                     - 27 -

                  Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") to be so qualified, and
                  each trust created thereunder has heretofore been determined
                  by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the provisions of
                  Section 501(a) of the IRC, and nothing has occurred since the
                  date of any such determination that, to the knowledge of
                  Leitch, could reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds
                  to revoke such determination.

         (iv)     No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement
                  affecting any of the Leitch Plans requires or permits a
                  retroactive increase in premiums or payments due thereunder.
                  The level of insurance reserves under each insured Leitch Plan
                  is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but
                  unreported claims.

         (v)      All liabilities of Leitch and each of its subsidiaries
                  (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) related
                  to the Leitch Plans have been fully and accurately accrued and
                  disclosed in all material respects and reported in accordance
                  with Canadian GAAP in the Leitch Financial Statements. No
                  changes have occurred or are expected to occur to any of the
                  Leitch Plans which would materially affect the most recent
                  financial statement prepared in respect of the applicable
                  Leitch Plan and required to be provided to Harris pursuant to
                  this Agreement.

         (vi)     No Leitch Plan, nor any related trust or funding medium
                  thereunder, is subject to any pending, or, to the knowledge of
                  Leitch, threatened or anticipated investigation, examination
                  or Proceeding, other than routine claims for benefits.

         (vii)    Except as expressly provided under this Agreement or the
                  Executive Agreements or as set out in the Leitch Disclosure
                  Letter, the execution of this Agreement and the completion of
                  the transactions contemplated herein will not (either alone or
                  in conjunction with any additional or subsequent events)
                  constitute an event under any Leitch Plan that will or may
                  result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
                  acceleration of payment or vesting of benefits, forgiveness of
                  indebtedness, vesting, distribution, restriction of funds,
                  increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
                  respect to any employee of Leitch or a subsidiary.

         (viii)   No U.S. Plan is or at any time was funded through a "welfare
                  benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the IRC, and no
                  benefits under any U.S. Plan are or at any time have been
                  provided through a voluntary employees' beneficiary
                  association (within the meaning of subsection 501(c)(9) of the
                  IRC) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within the
                  meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the IRC).

         (ix)     Neither Leitch nor its subsidiaries has agreed or committed to
                  institute any plan, program, arrangement or agreement for the
                  benefit of employees or former employees of Leitch or its
                  subsidiaries other than the Leitch Plans, or to make any
                  amendments to any of the Leitch Plans. Except as set out in
                  the Leitch Disclosure Letter, no Leitch Plan provides benefits
                  to retired employees or to the beneficiaries or dependants of
                  retired employees. No Leitch Plan provides benefits to any
                  individual who is not an employee, officer or director of
                  Leitch or



<PAGE>

                                     - 28 -

                  its subsidiaries, or the dependents or other beneficiaries of
                  any such employee, officer or director.

         (x)      Leitch or its subsidiaries, as applicable, has reserved all
                  rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the U.S. Plans
                  without the consent of any other Person.

         (xi)     Except as disclosed in the Leitch Disclosure Letter, no amount
                  that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
                  vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions

                  and satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions herein
                  contained in favour of each Party, promptly send to the
                  Director, for endorsement and filing, the Articles of
                  Arrangement and such other documents as may be required; and

         (n)      immediately after the Effective Time, obtain the resignations
                  of each member of the Leitch Board of Directors and assist in
                  causing them to be replaced by individuals nominated by Harris
                  and Harris Acquireco.

5.3      RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS


         The Circular shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Leitch that Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution and shall confirm the prior unanimous recommendation to the Leitch
Board of Directors in respect of the Arrangement from the special committee of
the Leitch Board of Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Leitch may change its recommendation to the
Shareholders and refrain from complying with its obligations under SECTION
5.2(k) if and to the extent that the Board of Directors determines, in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that such action is necessary
for the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
duties or applicable Laws. The foregoing shall not relieve Leitch from its
obligation to proceed to call and hold the Meeting and to hold the vote on the
Arrangement Resolution except in circumstances where this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

5.4      COVENANT OF LEITCH REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION

         (a) Leitch shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, employee, representative or agent of Leitch or any of its
subsidiaries, solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information or entering into any form
of agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or
proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal; provided that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Leitch, after the date
hereof, considering, negotiating, accepting, approving, recommending to the
Shareholders or entering into a Similar Confidentiality Agreement and providing
information pursuant to this SECTION 5.4 or entering into an agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that is a
Superior Proposal where: (i) the Person making such Superior Proposal or the
making of the Superior Proposal is not in breach of any agreement between such
Person and Leitch or its subsidiaries; and (ii) such Superior Proposal did not
result from a breach by Leitch of its obligations set forth in this SECTION 5.4
or in SECTION 5.5.

         (b) Leitch shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than Harris or its
representatives) with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal. Leitch
agrees not to release any third party from any confidentiality agreement to
which such third party is a party. Leitch further agrees not to release any
third party from any standstill agreement or provision to which such third party
is a party unless such third party has made a Superior Proposal to the extent of
such Superior Proposal. Leitch shall immediately request the return or
destruction of all information previously provided to any third party which has
entered into, at any time in the two year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, a confidentiality agreement with Leitch relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal and shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure
that such requests are honoured.

         (c) Leitch shall promptly notify Harris of any Acquisition Proposal and
communications related thereto of which any of its directors or officers become
aware after the date hereof (including the renewal of any Acquisition Proposal
made prior to the date hereof), or any amendments to the foregoing, or any
request for non-public information relating to Leitch or any of its
subsidiaries, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of Leitch or any subsidiary by any Person or entity
that informs Leitch or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has
made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto and a description of all material
terms of any oral or other communications related to an Acquisition Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal.

         (d) If Leitch receives a request for material non-public information
from a Person who proposes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal and the Board of
Directors of Leitch determines that such proposal would be a Superior Proposal
made in compliance with SUBSECTION 5.4(a) and takes all such necessary actions
as to ensure compliance with the terms thereof then, and only in such case, the
Board of Directors of Leitch may, subject to the execution by such Person of a
confidentiality agreement having confidentiality and standstill provisions and
other terms at least as restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement (a "SIMILAR
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), provide such Person with access to information
regarding Leitch or its subsidiaries; provided,

<PAGE>
                                      -41-



however that the Person making the Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded
thereunder from making such Acquisition Proposal, and provided further that
Leitch sends a copy of any such Similar Confidentiality Agreement to Harris
promptly upon its execution and Harris is promptly provided with a list and,
upon request, copies of all information provided to such Person and is promptly
provided with access to information similar to that which was provided to such
Person.

         (e) Leitch shall ensure that its senior officers and directors and any
financial or other advisors or representatives retained by it are aware of the
provisions of this SECTION 5.4, and it shall be responsible for any breach of
this SECTION 5.4 by any such Person or its advisors or representatives.

5.5      RIGHT TO MATCH

         (a) Leitch shall not accept, approve, recommend or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding to implement a Superior Proposal (other
than a Similar Confidentiality Agreement) without:

         (i)      complying fully with the provisions of SECTION 5.4;

         (ii)     providing to Harris (1) written notice that the Board of
                  Directors of Leitch has determined that it has received and is
                  prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and (2) a copy of any
                  proposal or commitment to make a Superior Proposal executed by
                  the Person making the Superior Proposal, in each case, as soon
                  as possible but in any event not less than five Business Days
                  prior to acceptance of the Superior Proposal by the Board of
                  Directors;

         (iii)    if such five Business Day period would not terminate on or
                  before the date fixed for the Meeting, Leitch shall adjourn
                  the Meeting to a date that is not less than two nor more than
                  five Business Days after the expiration of the five Business
                  Day period;

         (iv)     providing Harris with an opportunity (but not the obligation),
                  before the expiration of such five Business Day period, to
                  propose to amend this Agreement to provide for consideration
                  having a value and financial and other terms equivalent to or
                  more favourable to the Shareholders than those contained in
                  such Superior Proposal with the result that the Superior
                  Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal; and

         (v)      terminating this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.1(e) and
                  paying the Termination Fee to Harris.

         (b) In the event that Harris agrees to amend this Agreement in the
manner described in SUBSECTION 5.5(a)(iv), but otherwise on terms substantially
the same as the terms of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Leitch shall
consider the terms of the amendment and if it concludes the Superior Proposal is
no longer a Superior Proposal, Leitch shall not implement the proposed Superior
Proposal and may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.1(e), and
shall agree to the amendments to this Agreement.

<PAGE>
                                      -42-



         (c) In the event that Harris does not agree to amend this Agreement as
contemplated by SUBSECTION 5.5(b) and immediately prior to the termination of
this Agreement such Superior Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal in
comparison with the terms hereof, Leitch may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with SECTION 8.1(e) and thereafter may enter into an agreement in
order to implement the Superior Proposal.

5.6      COVENANTS OF HARRIS REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS

         Harris shall perform all obligations required to be performed by Harris
under this Agreement, co-operate with Leitch in connection therewith, and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to do all such other acts and things as may
be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make effective, as soon as
reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Harris shall and where
appropriate Harris shall cause its other subsidiaries to:

         (a)      apply for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
                  all Appropriate Regulatory Approvals relating to Harris and,
                  in doing so, keep Leitch informed as to the status of the
                  proceedings related to obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory
                  Approvals, including, but not limited to, providing Leitch
                  with copies of all related applications and notifications, in
                  draft form (other than commercially sensitive material that
                  may be required to be filed by Harris under the HSR Act in
                  connection with obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory
                  Approvals), in order for Leitch to provide its reasonable
                  comments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
                  Harris or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated
                  to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition,
                  enter into any consent decree, make any divestiture, accept
                  any operational restriction or take or commit to take any
                  action that would reasonably be expected to materially limit
                  Harris' ability to retain, own or operate any of the Business
                  or portions thereof, or alter or restrict in any material way
                  the Business or commercial practices of Harris or its
                  subsidiaries or affiliates, and Leitch shall not, without
                  Harris' prior written consent, take or commit to take any
                  action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of
                  the foregoing;

         (b)      cooperate with Leitch in the preparation of the Circular;

         (c)      ensure that its representatives attend the Meeting and the
                  hearings in respect of the Interim Order and the Final Order;

         (d)      use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
                  waivers, consents and approvals required to be obtained to
                  consummate the Arrangement;

         (e)      vote any Common Shares owned or over which control or
                  direction is exercised by it in favour of the Arrangement
                  Resolution and any related matters at the Meeting;

         (f)      effect all necessary registrations, filing, applications and
                  submissions of information required by a Governmental Entity
                  from Harris in connection with

<PAGE>
                                      -43-



                  the Arrangement and, if necessary, participate and appear in
                  any proceedings of either Party before or by any Governmental
                  Entity;

         (g)      defend or appeal any Proceeding relating to any injunction or
                  restraining order or other order or action seeking to stop or
                  otherwise adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to
                  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

         (h)      after the Effective Date, cause Leitch to maintain the
                  corporate governance and code of ethics policies of Leitch in
                  effect at the Effective Date until such time as Leitch ceases
                  to be a reporting issuer under applicable securities Laws; and

         (i)      ensure Harris Acquireco has sufficient funds to pay the
                  Aggregate Cash Consideration Payable to holders of Common
                  Shares and Leitch Options on the Effective Date and shall
                  cause the Common Share Consideration payable to holders of
                  Common Shares and the Option Consideration payable to holders
                  of Leitch Options at or after the Effective Time to be
                  deposited with the Depositary not later than immediately prior
                  to the Effective Time.

5.7      MUTUAL COVENANTS

         Each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise
expressly contemplated in this Agreement, during the period from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Date and the time that this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms:

         (a)      it shall not take any action which would reasonably be
                  expected to significantly impede the making or completion of
                  the Arrangement; and

         (b)      it shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to conduct its
                  affairs so that all of its representations and warranties
                  contained herein shall (i) to the extent qualified by
                  materiality, be true and correct in all respects, and (ii) to
                  the extent not qualified by materiality, be true and correct
                  in all material respects, in each case, on and as of the
                  Effective Date as if made thereon.

5.8      PRE-ACQUISITION REORGANIZATION

         Leitch agrees to effect prior to the Effective Date, at Harris'
expense, such reorganizations of its business, operations and assets or such
other transactions (each, a "PRE-ACQUISITION REORGANIZATION") as Harris may
reasonably request prior to the Effective Date, and the Plan of Arrangement, if
required, shall be modified accordingly in accordance with its terms, provided
that Harris shall provide written notice in reasonable detail to Leitch of any
proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least fifteen Business Days prior to
the Meeting Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Leitch shall not be obligated
to effect any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization which, in the opinion of Leitch,
acting reasonably, (A) would prejudice it or the Shareholders, or (B) would
impede or materially delay the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Harris agrees to indemnify and hold Leitch harmless from and against any
cost, liability or expense incurred by Leitch as a result of any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization undertaken if this Agreement is terminated. Harris acknowledges
and agrees that the

<PAGE>
                                      -44-



consummation of any Pre-acquisition Reorganization requested by Harris shall not
be a condition to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby or
effectiveness of the Arrangement.

                                   CONDITIONS

                  shall not have been set aside or modified in a manner

                  Resolution in accordance with the terms of the Interim Order;

                  manner unacceptable to either of the Parties, acting
                  reasonably, on appeal or otherwise;

         (d)      there shall be no Proceeding in progress of a judicial or
                  administrative nature or otherwise brought by or before a
                  Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to
                  result in an order, ruling, judgement or decree, or any Law
                  proposed, enacted, promulgated or applied, which:

                  (i)      makes illegal or otherwise directly or indirectly

                  (ii)     imposes damages, directly or indirectly, relating to
                           the transactions contemplated hereby which causes a
                           Material Adverse Effect on the Party to which it
                           applies; and

Parties and may be waived, in whole or in part, by either Party at any time,
provided that no Party may waive any mutual condition on behalf of the other
Party. If any of such conditions shall not have been complied with or waived on
or before the date required for their performance, either Party may terminate
this Agreement by written notice to the other and shall have no other right or
remedy against the other Party except as may be provided by ARTICLE VII or
ARTICLE VIII. No Party may rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above

obligations under this Agreement if the condition precedent would have been
satisfied but for a material default by the Party in complying with its
obligations hereunder.

                  certificate of two seniors officers certifying, in such
                  capacity and not personally, such truth and correctness on the

time and, unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be limited to
the specific condition waived. If any of such conditions shall not have been
complied with or waived by Harris on or before the date required for their
performance, Harris may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Leitch and
shall have no other right or remedy against Leitch except as may be provided by
ARTICLE VII or ARTICLE VIII. Harris may not rely on the failure to satisfy any
of the above conditions precedent as a basis for non-compliance by Harris of its
obligations under this Agreement if the condition precedent would have been
satisfied but for a material default by Harris in complying with its obligations
hereunder.

6.4      MERGER OF CONDITIONS

         The conditions set out in SECTIONS 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 shall be
conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released upon the filing
of the Articles of Arrangement as contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5      NOTICE AND CURE PROVISIONS

         Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement and

<PAGE>
                                      -47-



the Effective Time of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure
would, or would be likely to:

         (a)      cause any of the representations or warranties of either Party
                  contained herein qualified as to materiality to be untrue or
                  inaccurate or any of those not so qualified to be untrue or
                  inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
                  the Effective Date; or

         (b)      result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
                  condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
                  either Party hereunder prior to the Effective Date.

         No Party may elect not to complete the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the conditions set forth herein or exercise any termination right
arising therefrom unless forthwith and in any event prior to the Effective Time,
the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other
Party specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations
and warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment of the applicable condition or
exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is
delivered, provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter
and such matter is capable of being cured (except matters arising out of the
failure to make appropriate disclosure in the Leitch Disclosure Letter), no
Party may terminate this Agreement until the later of the Outside Date and the
expiration of a period of 30 days from such notice. If such notice has been
delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order or the
filing of the Articles of Arrangement with the Director, such application and
such filing shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. For greater
certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period
referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                 AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS

7.1      AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES


         Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 7.2, if, after the execution
of this Agreement, the Arrangement is not consummated and:

         (a)      Harris shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
                  SECTION 8.1(c);

         (b)      a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced,
                  proposed, offered or made to the Shareholders or to Leitch
                  prior to the Meeting and after such Acquisition Proposal shall
                  have been made known, made or announced the Arrangement
                  Resolution does not receive the required approval of the
                  Shareholders or the Arrangement Resolution is not submitted
                  for approval of the Shareholders and, in either event, that
                  Acquisition Proposal (the "FIRST ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") or any
                  other Acquisition Proposal publicly announced, proposed,
                  offered or made to the Shareholders or to Leitch while the
                  First Acquisition Proposal is outstanding (a "SUBSEQUENT
                  ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") or while any Subsequent Acquisition
                  Proposal is outstanding is completed

<PAGE>
                                      -48-



                  substantially in accordance with its terms on or prior to the
                  first anniversary of the Meeting Date; or

         (c)      Leitch shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
                  SECTION 8.1(e);

then, Leitch shall pay to Harris, within two Business Days of the first to occur
of the foregoing, a fee in the amount of $14,800,000 (the "TERMINATION FEE") as
liquidated damages in cash or immediately available funds to an account
designated by Harris.

7.2 REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES

         (a) Subject to SUBSECTION 2.7(e), CLAUSE 5.1(a)(iv), SECTION 5.8 and
SUBSECTIONS 7.2(b) and (c), each Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such Party in connection with this Agreement, the Arrangement and
the transactions contemplated therein.

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated by Harris pursuant to SUBSECTIONS
8.1(f) or 8.1(h) or if the Arrangement Resolution is not approved by the
Shareholders then, within five Business Days following receipt by Leitch of
notice of such termination or forthwith following the Meeting, as the case may
be, Leitch shall pay to Harris in cash or immediately available funds to an
account designated by Harris an amount equal to up to $2,500,000 as payment in
respect of Harris' actual costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the amount of such costs and
expenses to be certified by Harris to Leitch in writing in reasonable detail).

         (c) No fees shall be payable by Leitch under SUBSECTION 7.2(b) if
Leitch has paid the Termination Fee, and any fees paid by Leitch under
SUBSECTION 7.2(b) shall be credited against the Termination Fee to the extent
that it subsequently becomes payable by Leitch.

         (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Leitch pursuant to SUBSECTION
8.1(g) then, within five Business Days following receipt by Harris of notice of
such termination, Harris shall pay to Leitch in cash or immediately available
funds to an account designated by Leitch an amount equal to up to $2,500,000 as
payment in respect of Leitch's actual costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the amount of such costs
and expenses to be certified by Leitch to Harris in writing in reasonable
detail).

7.3      LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

         Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
ARTICLE VII are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate
of the damages which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer or incur as
a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination
of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right
it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive
or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to ARTICLE
VIII, payment of an amount determined pursuant to SECTION 7.1 OR 7.2(b) OR
7.2(d) in the manner provided in respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of
the Party receiving such payment. Nothing contained herein shall preclude a
Party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach
of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or

<PAGE>
                                      -49-



otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such acts, covenants or
agreements, without the necessity of posting a bond or security in connection
therewith.

7.4      ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

         (a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Date and the termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable notice, Leitch shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents to,
permit to Harris and to the officers, employees, agents and representatives of
Harris such reasonable access as Harris may reasonably require to Leitch's
officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall
furnish Harris with all data and information as Harris may reasonably request.

         (b) Reference is made to the confidentiality provisions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement (the "CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS"). The Parties
covenant and agree to observe the Confidentiality Provisions as if they were set
forth in this SECTION 7.4(b) mutatis mutandis.

7.5      INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) Harris will, or will cause Leitch to, at Harris' option, either (i)
maintain in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for not less than
six years from the Effective Date customary policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance providing protection comparable to the protection provided
by the policies maintained by Leitch in favour of the directors and officers of
Leitch and each of its subsidiaries which are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts
or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time or (ii) purchase as an
extension of Leitch's current insurance policies, prepaid non cancellable
run-off directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage
comparable to that contained in Leitch's existing policy for six years from the
Effective Time with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) Harris agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
(including rights under Leitch's corporate by-laws) now existing in favour of
any present or former officer or director of Leitch or any of its subsidiaries
shall survive the completion of the Arrangement and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Date and
Harris hereby assumes, effective upon completion of the Arrangement, all such
liability with respect to matters arising prior to the Effective Time.

         (c) In the event that Leitch or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such
successors and assigns of Leitch or, at Harris' option, Harris shall assume the
obligations set forth in this SECTION 7.5 without releasing in any respect
Harris' obligations hereunder.

         (d) The provisions of this SECTION 7.5 are (i) for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors,
administrators and other legal representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to

<PAGE>
                                      -50-



indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise, and the rights granted under this SUBSECTION 7.5(d) shall be held by
Leitch in trust for such persons provided, however, that no approval of any
beneficiary of such trust shall be required in connection with an amendment or
variation of this section prior to the Effective Date.

7.6      BROKERS

         Leitch and Harris represent and warrant to each other that, except for
CIBC World Markets Inc. in the case of Leitch and Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. in
the case of Harris, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission, or to the reimbursement of any
of its expenses, in connection with this Agreement or the Arrangement. Leitch
has provided to Harris a correct and complete copy of all agreements relating to
the arrangements between it and CIBC World Markets Inc. relating to the payment
of fees and expenses which are in effect at the date hereof and agrees not to
hereafter amend the terms of any such agreements without the prior written
approval of Harris.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TERMINATION

8.1      TERMINATION BY THE PARTIES

         This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
Date (without further action on the part of the Shareholders if terminated after
the Meeting):

         (a)      by the written agreement of Harris and Leitch (notwithstanding
                  any approval of the Arrangement by the Shareholders);

         (b)      by either Harris or Leitch, if any Law makes the Arrangement
                  or any part of it illegal or otherwise prohibited and such
                  illegality or prohibition becomes final and non-appealable, or
                  if any judgement, injunction, order or decree of a
                  Governmental Entity enjoining Harris or Leitch from proceeding
                  with or completing the Arrangement or any part of it is
                  entered and such judgement, injunction, order or decree has
                  become final and non-appealable;

         (c)      by Harris, if (i) the Board of Directors of Leitch fails to
                  recommend or confirm its recommendation to Shareholders to
                  vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution within three
                  Business Days of being requested to do so by Harris, or if the
                  Board of Directors of Leitch withdraws, modifies, or changes
                  its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement Resolution
                  in a manner adverse to Harris (it being understood that a
                  neutral position or no recommendation by the Board of
                  Directors of Leitch shall be considered to be adverse to
                  Harris) or if it shall have resolved to do so; (ii) Leitch has
                  materially breached its obligations under any of SECTIONS 5.4
                  or 5.5; or (iii) the Board of Directors of Leitch accepts,
                  approves, recommends or enters into an agreement (other than a
                  Similar Confidentiality Agreement) with any Person with
                  respect to a Superior Proposal;

         (d)      by either Harris or Leitch if at the Meeting, the Arrangement
                  Resolution does not receive the required approval of the
                  Shareholders;

<PAGE>
                                      -51-



         (e)      by Leitch, if the Board of Directors of Leitch shall have
                  accepted, approved, and concurrently with such termination,
                  entered into an agreement, arrangement or understanding to
                  implement a Superior Proposal in accordance with the
                  provisions of SECTION 5.4 (provided that such Superior
                  Proposal did not result from a breach of SECTION 5.4 OR 5.5 by
                  Leitch), provided that Leitch shall have paid to Harris the
                  Termination Fee;

         (f)      by Harris, if Leitch has breached any of its representations,
                  warranties, agreements or obligations in this Agreement, the
                  breach of which would result in the failure to satisfy the
                  conditions in SECTION 6.3(a) or (b);

         (g)      by Leitch, if Harris has breached any of its representations,
                  warranties, agreements or obligations in this Agreement, the
                  breach of which would result in the failure to satisfy one or
                  more of the conditions set forth in SECTION 6.2(a) or (b);

         (h)      by Harris, if there shall have occurred after the date hereof
                  (or prior to the date hereof to the extent the relevant
                  change, event, occurrence or development shall have been
                  disclosed generally or to Harris only after the date of this
                  Agreement) up to and including the Effective Date, a Material
                  Adverse Effect on Leitch; or

         (i)      by either Party if the Effective Date does not occur on or
                  before the Outside Date provided that the failure of the
                  Effective Date to so occur is not the result of the breach of
                  a representation, warranty or covenant by the Party
                  terminating this Agreement.

8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION

         In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances
set out in this ARTICLE VIII, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no force or effect, and no Party shall have any liability or further obligation
to the other Party hereunder except with respect to the obligations set forth in
SECTIONS 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4(b) and the first sentence of SECTION 7.6, which
shall survive such termination. However, nothing contained in this SECTION 8.2
or in ARTICLE VII including the payment of an amount under ARTICLE VII shall
relieve or have the effect of or result in relieving (i) in the event that the
Termination Fee has been paid by Leitch to Harris in accordance with SECTION
7.1, (A) Leitch in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by
Harris as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Leitch acting in bad faith
or in a manner intended and designed to result in the conditions precedent to
the completion of this Agreement not being satisfied, or (B) Harris in any way
from liability for damages incurred or suffered by Leitch as a result of a
breach of this Agreement by Harris, including without limitation as a result of
any inaccuracy in Harris' representations and warranties and any non-performance
by Harris of its covenants made herein; and (ii) in all other events, any Party
in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered by a Party as a
result of a breach of this Agreement by a Party, including without limitation as
a result of any inaccuracy in its representations and warranties and any
non-performance by it of its covenants made herein.

8.3      WAIVER

         Any Party may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other Party, (ii) waive compliance with any of the
other Party's agreements or the fulfilment of any conditions to its own
obligations contained herein, or (iii) waive inaccuracies in the other Party's
representations or warranties contained herein or in any document delivered by
the other Party; provided, however, that any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party and, unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be limited to
the specific breach or condition waived.

                                   ARTICLE IX

SECTION 7.5 and the Plan of Arrangement as it relates to the rights of
Shareholders and holders of other securities of Leitch, is not intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. The Parties shall

9.4      INVESTIGATIONS

         This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall be governed, including

respects as an Ontario contract.

9.6      VENUE

                  Depositary shall deliver to each holder of Leitch Options as
                  reflected on the books and records of Leitch a cheque or other
                  form of payment agreed to by the holder representing the
                  payment of the Option Consideration to which such holder is
                  entitled in accordance with this Plan of Arrangement.

         (d)      The Common Share Consideration and the Option Consideration
                  deposited with the Depositary shall in each case be held in an
                  interest bearing account and any interest earned on such funds
                  shall be for the account of Harris Acquireco.

SECTION 4.3 EXPIRATION OF RIGHTS. Any certificates formerly representing Common
Shares that, following the Effective Date, are not duly presented for payment
with the Depositary, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, and
such other documents as the Depositary deems necessary, or any payment made by
way of cheque by the Depositary on behalf of Harris Acquireco of the Common
Share Consideration or Option Consideration that has not been

<PAGE>



deposited or has been returned to the Depositary, or that otherwise remains
unclaimed, in each case on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Date, shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the
right of the holder of such securities to receive the Common Share Consideration
or the Option Consideration, as the case may be, pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement and shall be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to Harris
Acquireco for no consideration.

SECTION 4.4 LOST CERTIFICATES. In the event any certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares that were
exchanged pursuant to ARTICLE 2 hereof shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a cheque for the Cash
Consideration to which such holder is entitled deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with ARTICLE 2 and such holder's Letter of Transmittal.
When seeking such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Person to whom the Cash Consideration is payable shall, at the
discretion of Harris Acquireco, as a condition precedent to the delivery
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Harris, Harris Acquireco and the
Depositary, in such sum as the parties may reasonably direct or otherwise
indemnify Harris and Harris Acquireco against any claim that may be made against
Harris, Harris Acquireco or the Depositary with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                                    ARTICLE V
                               WITHHOLDING RIGHTS

SECTION 5.1 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Harris Acquireco, Leitch and the Depositary
shall deduct and withhold from the proceeds or amounts distributable or payable
pursuant to this Arrangement to any holder or former holder of Common Shares or
Leitch Options such amount as may be required by law (as advised by outside tax
counsel for Harris and Harris Acquireco) to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under any provision of United States or Canadian federal, state, provincial,
regional, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the
holder of the Common Shares or Leitch Options, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority within the
time required and in accordance with applicable law and that such holder has
been provided forthwith with a receipt evidencing such remittance.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                   AMENDMENTS

SECTION 6.1       AMENDMENT OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

         (a)      Harris, Harris Acquireco and Leitch reserve the right to
                  amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan of Arrangement at
                  any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Date
                  provided that any such amendment, modification, or supplement
                  must be contained in a written document which is (i) subject
                  to SECTION 6.1(b), agreed to by Harris, Harris Acquireco and
                  Leitch, (ii) filed with

<PAGE>


                  the Court and, if made following the Meeting, approved by the
                  Court subject to such conditions as the Court may impose and
                  (iii) communicated to holders of Common Shares in the manner
                  if and as required by the Court.

         (b)      Subject to the Arrangement Agreement, Harris shall be
                  entitled, at any time prior to the Meeting, to modify this
                  Plan of Arrangement to: (i) increase the consideration it or
                  Harris Acquireco is prepared to make available to Shareholders
                  pursuant to the Arrangement, whether or not the Board of
                  Directors of Leitch has changed its recommendation, provided
                  that Harris shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
                  provide not less than one Business Day's prior written notice
                  of such proposal to Leitch; or (ii) modify the terms of the
                  Plan of Arrangement to achieve tax planning objectives of
                  Harris and Harris Acquireco, including without limitation to
                  provide for one or more amalgamations of subsidiaries of
                  Harris and/or Leitch, which, in the opinion of Leitch, acting
                  reasonably, (A) would not prejudice it or the Shareholders, or
                  (B) would not impede or materially delay the completion of the
                  transactions contemplated hereby provided that Harris or
                  Harris Acquireco has provided notice of such modification to
                  Leitch not less than 15 Business Days prior to the Meeting
                  Date.

         (c)      Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
                  Arrangement referred to in SECTION 6.1(a) OR (b), if so
                  proposed and, subject to SECTION 6.1(b), accepted by the
                  Persons voting at the Meeting (other than as may be required
                  under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of
                  Arrangement for all purposes.

         (d)      Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
                  Arrangement which is approved by the Court following the
                  Meeting shall be effective only (i) if, subject to SECTION
                  6.1(b), it is agreed to by Harris, Harris Acquireco and
                  Leitch, and (iii) if required by the Court, it is consented to
                  by holders of Common Shares voting in the manner directed by
                  the Court.

Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be
made following the Effective Date unilaterally by Harris Acquireco, provided
that it concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Harris Acquireco,
is of an administrative nature required to better give effect to the
implementation of this Plan of Arrangement and is not adverse to the financial
or economic interests of the holders of Common Shares or the Leitch Options.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or supplement to this
Plan of Arrangement made following the Effective Date shall be effective prior
to the issuance by the Director of a Certificate of Arrangement endorsing
amended Articles of Arrangement.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                     GENERAL

acts, deeds, agreements, transfers, assurances, instruments or documents as may
reasonably be required by any of them in order further to document or evidence
any of the transactions or events set out herein.

SECTION 7.2 PARAMOUNTCY. From and after the Effective Time (i) this Plan of
Arrangement shall take precedence and priority over any and all rights related
to Common Shares and Leitch Options issued prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the
rights and obligations of the holders of Common Shares and Leitch Options and
any trustee and transfer agent therefore, shall be solely as provided for in
this Plan of Arrangement, and (iii) all actions, causes of actions, claims or
proceedings (actual or contingent, and whether or not previously asserted) based

have been settled, compromised, released and determined without liability except
