(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, but, in each case, on the Closing Date,
Parent shall make (or cause to be made) the following payments or deliveries,
as applicable:

 



 

(i) to an account designated in writing by the Payment Agent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount equal to the Closing
Merger Consideration (less the Closing NOL Adjustment Amount and any Closing
Merger Consideration applicable to Dissenting Shares), to be used for payment
of the Closing Merger Consideration to Stockholders for which or whom a Letter
of Transmittal (as defined below) has been properly completed and received
(together with any Certificates or other credentials, as applicable) by the
Payment Agent, in accordance with the terms of the Payment Agent Agreement;

 



 

(ii) on behalf of the Company, to such accounts designated in writing by the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount, in the
aggregate, equal to the Closing Indebtedness to enable the Company to repay,
or cause to be repaid, the Closing Indebtedness set forth on the Indebtedness
Statement;

 



 

(iii) on behalf of the Company, to such accounts designated in writing by the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount, in the
aggregate, equal to the Unpaid Transaction Expenses to enable the Company to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Unpaid Transaction Expenses set forth on the
Unpaid Transaction Expenses Statement;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) on behalf of the Stockholders, to an account designated in writing by the
Escrow Agent to be governed by the Escrow Agreement (such account, the "
**Escrow Account** "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to the Escrow Amount, and for all purposes hereunder each
Stockholder shall be deemed to have contributed its Allocable Percentage of
the Escrow Amount; and

 



 

(v) on behalf of the Stockholders, to an account designated in writing by the
Representative to be governed by _Section 12.03_ and the provisions of the
Letter of Transmittal (such account, the " **Representative Fund** "), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Representative
Fund Amount, and for all purposes hereunder each Stockholder shall be deemed
to have contributed its Allocable Percentage of the Representative Fund
Amount.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Representative will engage the Payment
Agent pursuant to the Payment Agent Agreement. At any time after the date
hereof, the Company shall cause a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (each, a " **Letter of Transmittal** ") to be delivered
to each Stockholder. After the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Common Stock (other than certificates
representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) (collectively, the "
**Certificates** "), upon surrender of such Certificates to the Payment Agent
(or a lost Certificate affidavit) and a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive (in accordance with the
terms hereof) in exchange therefor an amount in cash (without interest) per
share equal to the Common Per Share Merger Consideration, as indicated on the
Payment Schedule and pursuant to the terms hereof, and such Certificate shall,
after such surrender, be marked as canceled. If a Stockholder delivers a
Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to pay such Stockholder at the
Closing the Common Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each share
surrendered by such Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the Payment Agent
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment to Actua Holdings, Inc.
(" **Actua Holdings** "), a wholly owned subsidiary of Actua, in respect of
the Closing Common Per Share Consideration shall be reduced by the Closing NOL
Adjustment Amount, if any, as a set off in respect of Actua Holdings
obligations under _Section 8.03(a)_.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Certificate for shares of Common Stock has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall pay such portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement
in exchange therefore upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, together with an indemnity in customary form in favor of the
Surviving Corporation, as a condition precedent to the payment of any portion
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration attributable to such shares of Common
Stock.

 



 

(d) If any payment under this Agreement is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not payable.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
transfers of any shares of Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.06_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender such
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to
this Agreement in exchange therefore in respect of such security represented
by such Certificate. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled, delivered to the Payment
Agent and exchanged for the respective portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration they represent, as provided in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the portions of Closing
Merger Consideration payable to any particular Stockholder upon Closing shall
be as set forth opposite such Stockholders name on the Payment Schedule;
_provided, however,_ that, pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_, any amounts payable
to Actua Holdings shall be reduced by the Closing NOL Adjustment Amount, if
any.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Payment Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ that remains unclaimed by
Stockholders 12 months after the time it was delivered to the Payment Agent
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any such
Stockholder who has not exchanged shares of Common Stock for, or otherwise
claimed, the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article 2_ prior to that time thereafter will look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Applicable Laws) for payment of the applicable portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Stock Options_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary (including any necessary determinations and
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof) such that each Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective
Time be cancelled and terminated in accordance with the following two
sentences. Each Option that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and does not become vested in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective
Time without any payment of consideration therefor. The holder of a vested
Option shall be given the opportunity to exercise such Option, and to the
extent such Option is not timely exercised prior to the Closing, such Option
shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time without any payment
of consideration therefor.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Stockholder who
is entitled to and has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted
into or exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 2.04(a)_, but shall be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive such consideration
as shall be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each share of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration set
forth in _Section 2.04(a)_ (without interest), and such share shall no longer
be a Dissenting Share. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by it for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other related instruments received by it. Parent shall
have the right, to the extent reasonably practicable, to receive notice of and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
and the exercise of such appraisal rights under the DGCL. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent and, if prior to the Closing, the Company, no
party hereto shall make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands. The Company shall provide to those Stockholders who
did not execute the Written Consent all information required by Section 228 of
the DGCL, including the information with respect to appraisal rights required
by Section 262 of the DGCL, and any other Applicable Law (including any other
applicable section of the DGCL and the securities laws).

 



 

Section 2.09. _Post-Closing Statement._

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no
event later than 95 days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered
to the Representative, a statement setting forth Parents good faith
calculation of (i) Closing Working Capital (including each component item
thereof as set forth on the Illustrative Working Capital Statement), (ii)
Unpaid Transaction Expenses, (iii) Closing Cash, (iv) Closing Indebtedness and
(v) Client Consent Adjustment Amount, together with Parents calculation of
the Final Merger Consideration (the " **Initial** **Calculation** "),
including such schedules and data with respect to the determination of each
component thereof as may be appropriate to support such Initial Calculation.
The Closing Working Capital shall be calculated and presented in the same
manner as is prescribed for the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital
in _Section 2.05(e)_.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after receipt by the Representative of the Initial
Calculation, the Representative may deliver to Parent a written notice (the "
**Calculation Notice** ") either (i) advising Parent that the Representative
agrees with and accepts the Initial Calculation (in which case the Initial
Calculation shall be deemed to be the final calculation of the Final Merger
Consideration (the " **Final Calculation** ")) or (ii) setting forth an
explanation in reasonable detail of those items in the Initial Calculation
that the Representative disputes and of what the Representative believes is
the correct calculation of each disputed item and the Final Calculation. The
Representative and the accountants and other advisors engaged by the
Representative shall be entitled to review the Companys working papers, trial
balances and similar materials for purposes of reviewing the Initial
Calculation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall provide the Representative and the accountants and other advisors
engaged by the Representative with timely and reasonable access, during the
Companys normal business hours, to the Companys personnel, properties, books
and records, in each case for purposes of reviewing the Initial Calculation
and at the Companys sole expense. If the Representative does not submit a
Calculation Notice within the 30-day period provided herein, then the Initial
Calculation shall be deemed to be the Final Calculation and shall not be
subject to further review, challenge or adjustment. Parent and its accountants
shall be entitled to review the working papers, trial balances and similar
materials relating to the Representatives preparation of its Calculation
Notice. If Parent concurs with the Calculation Notice, or if Parent

 



      
 

 



 

does not object to the Calculation Notice in a writing received by the
Representative within 30 days after Parents receipt of the Calculation Notice
(such writing, an " **Objection Notice** "), the calculation of the Final
Merger Consideration set forth in the Calculation Notice shall be deemed to be
the Final Calculation and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve any
disputes regarding the Initial Calculation within 15 days after the date of
the Representatives receipt of the Objection Notice, then such disputes shall
be referred to and resolved by a nationally or regionally recognized
accounting firm that has been mutually agreed upon by the parties in good
faith (such firm, the " **Settlement Accountants** "), and the calculation of
the Final Merger Consideration of the Settlement Accountants shall be deemed
to be the Final Calculation and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment, absent fraud. The Settlement Accountants shall
determine the Final Merger Consideration in accordance with the standards
described in this _Section 2.09_ and shall be instructed by Parent and the
Representative to use their reasonable best efforts to reach such
determination not more than thirty (30) days after such referral. Nothing
herein shall be construed to authorize or permit the Settlement Accountants to
resolve any item in dispute by making an adjustment to the Initial Calculation
that is outside of the range for such item defined by the Initial Calculation
and the Calculation Notice. Each of Representative and Parent shall pay its
own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this _Section 2.09_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the costs of any fees and expenses of the
Settlement Accountant shall be borne equally by Representative, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand.

 



 

(d) The " **Merger Consideration** **Adjustment Amount** ," which may be
positive or negative, shall mean (i) the Final Merger Consideration, as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.09_, _minus_ (ii) the
Closing Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) If the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then:

 



 

(i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to deliver, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Payment Agent, for the benefit of (and, in accordance with
other terms of this Agreement, for further payment to) the Stockholders, an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, which amount shall
be paid by the Payment Agent to the Stockholders in accordance with their
respective Allocable Percentages in accordance with the Payment Agent
Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) Parent and the Representative shall provide a joint written instruction
to the Escrow Agent to release from the Working Capital Escrow Fund, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in _Section
2.09(e)(i)_, for the benefit of (and, in accordance with other terms of this
Agreement, for further payment to) the Stockholders, an amount equal to the
Working Capital Escrow Amount, which amount shall be paid by the Payment Agent
to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Allocable Percentages
in accordance with the Payment Agent Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(f) If the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then:

 



 

(i) Parent and the Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to deliver from the Working Capital Escrow Fund to the
Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Surviving Corporation, an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount;

 



 

(ii) the funds remaining (if any) in the Working Capital Escrow Fund, after
giving effect to _Section 2.09(f)(i)_, shall be released to the Stockholders
in accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section 2.09(e)(ii)_; and

 



 

(iii) if the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount payable to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.09(f)(i)_ exceeds the amount of funds in
the Working Capital Escrow Fund, the Stockholders shall pay such excess to the
Surviving Corporation, severally and not jointly, in accordance with each
Stockholders Allocable Percentage, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than five (5) Business Days following the date the Final
Calculation becomes final and binding in accordance with this _Section 2.09_
to an account designated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(g) If the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is zero, then the entire
amount of the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be released to the
Stockholders in accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section
2.09(e)(ii)_.

 



 

(h) Amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ shall be deemed adjustments
to the Aggregate Merger Consideration. For purposes of this _Section 2.09_,
all computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days,
in each case, for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is
payable. Any payments made by any Person pursuant to this _Section 2.09_
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Calculation has occurred.

 



 

(i) Parent, the Company and the Representative agree that the procedures set
forth in this _Section 2.09_ for resolving disputes with respect to the
Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount shall be the sole and exclusive method
for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ that this provision shall not
prohibit Parent or the Representative from instituting litigation to enforce
any final determination of the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount by the
Settlement Accountants pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ in any court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Sections 13.07_ and _13.08_ ;
_provided, however,_ that the substance of the Settlement Accountants
determination shall not be subject to review or appeal.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Withholding. _Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and the Payment Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other payments contemplated by this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state or local Tax law,
and Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the

 



      
 

 



 

Payment Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay such amounts to the applicable
Taxing Authority; __provided_ , _however_ ,_ that for any payments other than
payments to employees or other service providers of the Company that are
compensatory, Parent shall provide the Company and the Representative written
notice prior to making any such deduction or withholding to allow the Company
and the Representative to obtain a reduction of or relief from such deduction
or withholding, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company and the
Representative, to the extent reasonable, in efforts to obtain any such
reduction of or relief from deduction or withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Stockholder
or such other Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.06 _to obtain all
requisite approvals, clearances, terminations of waiting periods and other
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act, use its reasonable best efforts to, except as may be prohibited by

(c) Parent shall pay all filing fees applicable to the Notification and Report
Form filed pursuant to the HSR Act or any filings required by any Legal
Requirements of any foreign Governmental Authority and all other costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of _Section 7.06_,
except that each party shall pay its other costs and expenses in connection
with performing their respective obligations under the first sentence of
_Section 7.06_. Subject to _Article 11_ as it relates to any partys ability
to terminate this Agreement following the End Date, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with authority over antitrust

Section 7.07. _Employee Matters._

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
terms as in effect on the Closing Date, all existing employment, retention,
incentive, change in control and severance agreements between the Company or
any Subsidiary and any employees of the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are listed on _Schedule 7.07(a)_. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make the 2017 plan year
employer matching contributions to the Companys 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan;
_provided, however,_ that such employer matching contributions shall relate
only to contributions in respect of services performed prior to the plans
termination, and shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of the plan,
past practice, and Applicable Law.

 



 



 

(b) Parent is not planning or contemplating, and has not made or taken, any
decisions or actions concerning any employees of the Company or any Subsidiary
that would require, prior to the Effective Time, the service of notice under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other similar
Applicable Law (the " **WARN Act** "). Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to not, at any time within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date engage in any conduct which, alone or if aggregated with any such

 



      
 

 



 

conduct on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing
Date, would trigger or result in notice, severance or other rights or
obligations under the WARN Act.

 



 

Section 7.08. _Consent of Investment Advisory Clients._

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall,
or shall cause the appropriate Subsidiary to, send a notice substantially in
the form of _Exhibit F_ to each Investment Advisory Client or an agent of
such Investment Advisory Client (" **Consent Notice** ") informing such
Investment Advisory Client of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and requesting such Investment Advisory Clients consent in writing to the
deemed assignment of its Investment Advisory Contracts and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.

 



 

(b) If an Investment Advisory Contract for any client listed on _Exhibit D_
by its terms requires written consent for the deemed assignment thereof (such
Investment Advisory Contracts with clients set forth on _Schedule 7.08(b)_ , "
**Affirmative Consent Contracts** "), such consent shall be deemed given only
upon receipt of written consent from the applicable Investment Advisory Client
or its agent as contemplated by the Consent Notice.

 



 

(c) The deemed assignment of each Investment Advisory Contract for any client
listed on _Exhibit D_ that is not an Affirmative Consent Contract (such
Investment Advisory Contracts with clients set forth on _Schedule 7.08(c)_ , "
**Negative Consent Contracts** ") shall be deemed consented to upon either (i)
receipt of written consent from the applicable Investment Advisory Client or
its agent or (ii) the negative consent procedures set forth in such Negative
Consent Contract being followed or, in the absence of any specified negative
consent procedures in such Negative Consent Contract, the passage of 60 days
from sending the Consent Notice without receipt by the Company of a notice
from the applicable client validly objecting to the deemed assignment.

 



 

(d) With respect to the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 7.08(d)_ , the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed consented to upon receipt of
written consent from the applicable client or, to the extent applicable, the
expiration or waiver of any termination, acceleration or similar right
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) In connection with seeking the consent required for any Affirmative
Consent Contract or any Contract set forth on _Schedule 7.08(d)_ , the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consent. The Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (i) to continue to
use such commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing until (A) the
date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date or (B) with respect to
any Contracts set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)_ , the date indicated as the "Cut
Off Date" in the table therein (including, in each case, by providing any
notices contemplated by the relevant Contract) and (ii) to deliver written
notice to the Representative promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) following the receipt of any Consent following the Closing
(including a deemed consent pursuant to _Section 7.08(d)_). From the date of
this Agreement until the date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date
(or, with respect to any Contracts set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)_ , the date
indicated as the "Cut Off Date" in the table therein), Parent and its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates (which shall include the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Closing) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in
obtaining the Consents and shall not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to delay, prevent, impede or interfere with, or could otherwise
reasonably be expected to be detrimental to, obtaining any Consent; _provided_
that neither Parent nor its Affiliates (which shall include the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Closing) shall be required to
amend or otherwise agree to any revisions to any pricing provisions in any of
the relevant Contracts.

 



 

Section 7.09. _R andW Policy._

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and cause to be bound as promptly as practicable a RandW
Policy from AIG (i) with a limitation of liability no less than $30,000,000,
(ii) with a Retention Amount no greater than $1,950,000 and (iii) that
excludes any and all rights of subrogation against the Stockholders and the
Representative under this Agreement except with respect to fraud ((i) through
(iii), the " **Policy Conditions** " and, such RandW Policy from AIG, the "
**AIG Policy** "). Prior to binding any RandW Policy, Parent shall provide the
Company with a copy of such policy and use reasonable best efforts to make any
changes reasonably requested by the Company.

 



 

(b) In the event the AIG Policy is not bound by October 4, 2017, Parent shall
promptly inform the Company and, upon the Companys reasonable request, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain an alternative RandW Policy from an insurer
acceptable to the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) with terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Stockholders than the Policy Conditions
(unless the Company otherwise waives such requirement with respect to the
Policy Conditions) (such a RandW Policy, an " **Alternative Policy** "). The
Company shall have the right to review and approve (acting reasonably and in
good faith) any Alternative Policy prior to binding and, to the extent the
Company deems the Policy Conditions of an Alternative Policy insufficient,
Parent shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain an Alternative
Policy from an insurer acceptable to the Company (acting reasonably and in
good faith). To the extent the premium necessary to obtain an Alternative
Policy exceeds $930,000, such excess shall be considered an Unpaid Transaction
Expense for purposes of this Agreement. For all purposes of this _Section
7.09(b)_, the Company acknowledges and agrees that all insurers set forth in
that certain "Quote Summary for Buyer-Side Representations and Warranties
Insurance," dated August 29, 2017 are acceptable to the Company.

 



 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
Parents efforts to obtain and cause to be bound the AIG Policy and any
Alternative Policy, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in
obtaining the AIG Policy and any Alternative Policy, including promptly
responding to all reasonable due diligence requests of the applicable insurer.

 



 

(d) To the extent any Parent Indemnified Party is unable to recover Damages
under the RandW Policy that it would have reasonably been expected to recover
from AIG under the representation and warranty insurance policy contemplated
by the AIG NBIL had it been bound as of the date hereof without any exclusions
other than the Express Exclusions (such Damages, the " **Section 7.09
Damages**"), the Stockholders will indemnify such Parent Indemnified Party for
any and all such Section 7.09 Damages subject to the limitations set forth

 



      
 

 



 

in _Article 10_. The Company and Representative hereby acknowledge and agree
that Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover as Section 7.09
Damages in respect of any Company Warranty Breach that first occurs after the
date of this Agreement and has to be disclosed on the No Claims Declaration
(as referred to in the AIG NBIL) delivered upon the initial binding of the RandW
Policy for purposes of this _Section 7.09(d)_ and all purposes of _Article
10_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Express Exclusions (and the fact that
they are not included in the definition of Section 7.09 Damages) do not
otherwise impact the covenants and obligations of the parties set forth in
this Agreement, including _Section 2.09_.

 



 

(e) Once bound, Parent will not amend or waive, or permit the amendment or
waiver of, the subrogation or third-party beneficiary provisions contained in
the RandW Policy benefitting the Stockholders or the Representative or otherwise
amend or modify the RandW Policy in a manner adverse to the Stockholders or the
Representative without the prior written consent of the Representative.
Subject to the penultimate sentence of _Section 7.09(b)_, Parent agrees to
pay the total premium for the RandW Policy in accordance with the terms of the
RandW Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the effectiveness of the RandW Policy is not a condition to the Closing.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Required Stockholder Approval_. Promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto), the Company and the Representative shall
deliver to Parent a copy of the Written Consent duly executed by the
Representative or the applicable Stockholder Affiliate of the Representative
and certified as true by an officer of the Company.

 



 

Section 7.11. _606 Deliverables. _(a) Set forth on _Schedule 7.11_ hereto is a
list of items that the Company and Parent have acknowledged and agreed shall
be produced on behalf of the Company by the Accounting Representative and
delivered to Parent between the date hereof and the Closing in connection with
the Surviving Corporations adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Update 2016-08 (Topic 606) (such items, collectively, the
" **606 Deliverables** "). Representative and the Company shall cause the
Accounting Representative to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent in
writing (including via e-mail) each 606 Deliverable as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days following the date that
corresponds to the applicable 1st draft 606 Deliverable deadline on _Schedule
7.11_. Parent shall then deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Accounting
Representative in writing (including via e-mail) any and all reasonable, good
faith comments with respect to such 606 Deliverable as promptly as
practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days following the date that
corresponds to the applicable 1st draft 606 Deliverable comment period on
_Schedule 7.11_ ; _provided_ , that if Representative does not deliver a 606
Deliverable prior to or on the date that corresponds to the applicable 1st
draft 606 Deliverable deadline on _Schedule 7.11_ , such comment period shall
be extended by one (1) Business Day for each Business Day from such deadline
until such 606 Deliverable is delivered. If Parent delivers comments to any
606 Deliverable pursuant to the preceding sentence, Representative and the
Company shall then cause the Accounting Representative to deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to Parent in writing (including via e-mail) a revised 606
Deliverable incorporating in good faith any reasonable comments delivered by
Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days following the date that
corresponds to the applicable 2nd draft 606 Deliverable deadline on _Schedule
7.11_. Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

then deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Accounting Representative in
writing (including via e-mail) any and all further reasonable, good faith
comments with respect to such revised 606 Deliverable as promptly as
practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days following the date that
corresponds to the applicable 2nd draft 606 Deliverable comment period on
_Schedule 7.11_ ; _provided_ , that if Representative does not deliver a 606
Deliverable prior to or on the date that corresponds to the applicable 2nd
draft 606 Deliverable deadline on _Schedule 7.11_ , such comment period shall
be extended by one (1) Business Day for each Business Day from such deadline
until such 606 Deliverable is delivered. If Parent delivers comments to any
revised 606 Deliverable pursuant to the preceding sentence, Representative and
the Company shall then cause the Accounting Representative to deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to Parent in writing (including via e-mail) a further
revised 606 Deliverable incorporating in good faith any reasonable comments
delivered by Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days following
the date that corresponds to the applicable 3rd draft 606 Deliverable deadline
on _Schedule 7.11_. Parent shall then deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Accounting Representative in writing (including via e-mail) any and all
further reasonable, good faith comments with respect to such revised 606
Deliverable as promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business
Days following the date that corresponds to the applicable 3rd draft 606
Deliverable comment period on _Schedule 7.11;_ _provided_ , that if
Representative does not deliver a 606 Deliverable prior to or on the date that
corresponds to the applicable 3rd draft 606 Deliverable deadline on _Schedule
7.11_ , such comment period shall be extended by one (1) Business Day for each
Business Day from such deadline until such 606 Deliverable is delivered.
Parent shall, and Representative and the Company shall cause the Accounting
Representative to, work in good faith with Parents and the Companys
respective independent auditors (i.e., KPMG LLP) and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve any and all of Parents comments in a
timely manner such that the relevant 606 Deliverable may be substantially
completed on the applicable timetable set forth on _Schedule 7.11_ (taking
into account any extensions provided for in this _Section 7.11(a)_) and
agreed upon (including for purposes of _Section 9.02(j)_).

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company (through the Accounting Representative)
shall work in good faith and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or desirable to cause each of the 606 Deliverables to be
substantially completed on the applicable timetable set forth on _Schedule
7.11_ (taking into account any extensions provided for in _Section 7.11(a)_)
and agreed upon (including for purposes of _Section 9.02(j)_). Parent and the
Company (through the Accounting Representative) agree to incur such reasonable
expenses and to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other actions, in each case, as
may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to cause each of the 606
Deliverables to be substantially completed on the applicable timetable set
forth on _Schedule 7.11_ (taking into account any extensions provided for in
_Section 7.11(a)_) and agreed upon (including for purposes of _Section
9.02(j)_).

 



 

(c) Representative and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Representatives independent auditor to present the 606 Deliverables to
Representatives audit committee on or before December 8, 2017 or on such
other date as Representative and Parent shall mutually agree in writing
(including via e-mail), it being understood that no formal

 



      
 

 



 

or informal opinion of the independent auditors as to the Companys ultimate
compliance with Topic 606 shall be required in connection with such
presentation.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent, on the one hand, and Representative and the Company, on
the other hand, shall use reasonable best efforts cause Parents and
Representatives respective independent auditors to jointly present the 606
Deliverables to Parents audit committee on or before December 8, 2017 or on
such other date as Representative and Parent shall mutually agree in writing
(including via e-mail), it being understood that no formal or informal opinion
of the independent auditors as to the Companys ultimate compliance with Topic
606 shall be required in connection with such presentation.

 



 

(e) If at any time after December 8, 2017 the Company reasonably believes that
each of the 606 Deliverables is final and, but for Parents agreement in
accordance with this _Section 7.11_, the condition set forth in _Section
9.02(j)_ is satisfied, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that
effect (the " **Company 606 Notice** "). Parent shall have five (5) Business
Days after the delivery of such notice by the Company to deliver a written
notice to the Company asserting that one or more of the 606 Deliverables are
not final and, but for Parents agreement in accordance with this _Section
7.11_, the condition set forth in _Section 9.02(j)_ is satisfied and stating
in reasonable detail the basis for such position, which may include (without
limitation) reasonable comments made in good faith that the Company has
received from Parents or Representatives respective independent auditors,
Parents or Representatives respective audit committees or their members, or
that arise from newly issued interpretive guidance with respect to Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2016-08 (Topic 606)
(such notice from Parent, a " **606 Dispute Notice** "). If Parent does not
timely deliver a 606 Dispute Notice, then the condition set forth in _Section
9.02(j)_ shall be deemed automatically satisfied. If Parent does timely
deliver a 606 Dispute Notice, the Company and Parent shall each use reasonable
best efforts and work in good faith for a period of no less than five (5)
Business Days to discuss the 606 Dispute Notice and address the steps or
information necessary to finalize the 606 Deliverables and satisfy the
condition set forth in _Section 9.02(j)_ (a " **Resolution Period** "). After
each such Resolution Period, the Company may deliver a new Company 606 Notice,
in which case the preceding three sentences shall apply to such Company 606
Notice in all respects.

 



 

ARTICLE 8 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

Section 8.01. _Tax Covenants._

 



 

(a) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted but not required
under Applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable
period, then the parties shall treat that day as the last day of the taxable
period. The portion of any Taxes for a Straddle Period that are allocable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined using the interim closing of the books method (in the case of any
Tax based on or measured by income, receipts, sales, use, payroll or
employment, or similar event-based Taxes) and the "calendar day" convention
(in the case of other Taxes, such as property taxes).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Merger shall be borne
one-half by the Stockholders and one-half by the Parent. Parent shall, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes in
a timely manner, and, if required by Applicable Law, the Representative will,
and will cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

 



 

(c) The Representative shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all U.S. federal and state Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods where the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated, unitary or combined group of
which the Representative is the common parent. The Representative shall permit
Parent to review and comment on any separate draft _pro forma_ Tax Return form
that will be used to prepare the consolidated Tax Return for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period prior to filing and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments to such Tax Return provided by Parent, in writing, within ten (10)
days of Parents receipt of the Tax Return. Parent shall prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed all other Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries and all Tax Returns for the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date. Parent shall permit the
Representative to review and comment on any Pre-Closing Tax Returns and
Straddle Period Tax Returns prior to filing and shall consider in good faith
any reasonable comments to the Tax Returns as are provided by the
Representative in writing within ten (10) days of the Representatives receipt
of the Tax Returns. The Representative shall pay the Parent for the amount of
Tax on any such Pre-Closing Tax Return and Straddle Period Tax Return
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period hereunder at least five (5) days prior
to the filing of such Tax Return.

 



 

(d) After the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to not, amend, file, re-file, make, revoke or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to have an adverse effect for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, unless required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) The Representative shall control any Tax Contest that involves, in whole
or in part, any Taxes of, or a Tax Return of, a consolidated, unitary or
combined group that includes the Company or its Subsidiaries and the
Representative of which the Representative is the common parent, and Parent
shall control any other Tax Contest. In the case of any Tax Contest with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, the Parent shall (i)
promptly notify the Representative of such Tax Contest and forward copies of
appropriate notices and forms or other communications received from, or sent
to, any Governmental Entity which relate to the Tax Contest to the
Representative, (ii) keep the Representative reasonably informed of all
material developments in such Tax Contest, and (iii) not settle, compromise or
otherwise dispose of such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); _provided_ that any failure to comply with subsections (i) and
(ii) of this sentence will not relieve the Representative or the Stockholders
of any liability with respect to such Tax Contest except to the extent the
Representative or Stockholders were actually prejudiced as a result thereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.01(e)_ to the contrary, the
Representative shall have no rights with respect to any Tax Contest which
involves in whole or in part any Taxes of, or a Tax Return of, the
consolidated, unitary or combined group including Parent (or any member
thereof other than the Surviving Corporation), and Parent shall have no rights
with respect to any Tax Contest which involves in

 



      
 

 



 

whole or in part any Taxes of, or a Tax Return of, the consolidated, unitary
or combined group including Representative.

 



 

(f) Any Tax refunds or Tax credits that are received by or credited to Parent,
its Affiliates, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Stockholders, and
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid over to the Representative (for the
account of the Stockholders) any such refund or credit (and any interest with
respect thereto) within thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt or credit
thereof. Tax deductions arising in connection with payment of Unpaid
Transaction Expenses, Closing Indebtedness and other compensatory payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to arise in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period for applicable income Tax purposes.

 



 

(g) Except to the extent required by Applicable Law, Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not make or cause to be
made or permit to be made any extraordinary transaction or event on the
Closing Date after the Closing that would result in any increased Liability
with respect to Taxes for which indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
would be required or for which the Stockholders would otherwise be responsible
without the consent of the Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(h) All Tax sharing agreements, Tax indemnification agreements, or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company or its Subsidiaries and
any other Person shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, neither the Surviving Corporation nor its Subsidiaries shall be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(i) The last day on which the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be included
in the consolidated group (as described in Treasury Regulation section
1.1502-1(h)) that includes Actua shall be December 31, 2017, unless Parent
provides written consent to the Representative otherwise, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(j) Parent and its Affiliates shall promptly provide Representative with a
copy of the final Tax Analysis upon completion thereof.

 



 

Section 8.02. _Cooperation On Tax Matters._

 



 

(a) Parent and the Representative shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ that
Parent shall not be required to provide the Representative with the portion of
any records, Tax Returns or any other information, in each case which includes
any information relating to any member (other than the Surviving Corporation
or the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries) of a consolidated, unitary or
combined group including the Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent and Representative further agree, and agree to cause their
Affiliates, upon request, to use all reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or customer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

Section 8.03. _Net Operating Losses_.

 



 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, Actua shall
deliver to Parent a statement (the " **NOL Statement** ") setting forth a good
faith estimate of the NOL Amount (the " **Closing NOL Amount** ") together
with reasonable supporting documentation. If the Closing NOL Amount is less
than $36 million, Actua Holdings shall be obligated to pay Parent $.3105 for
each dollar the Closing NOL Amount is less than $36 million (the amount of
such product, if any, the " **Closing NOL Adjustment Amount** ") and, in
satisfaction of such payment obligation, the Representative and Parent shall
instruct the Payment Agent to reduce the amount otherwise payable to Actua
Holdings pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_ by the Closing NOL Adjustment Amount.
If the Closing NOL Amount is equal to or greater than $36 million, the Closing
NOL Adjustment Amount shall be zero.

 



 

(b) No later than April 2, 2018, Actua shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
second NOL Statement with an updated good faith estimate of the NOL Amount
(the " **Interim NOL Amount** ") and a second Closing NOL Adjustment Amount
based thereon (such revised amount, the " **Interim NOL Adjustment Amount** ")
together with reasonable supporting documentation. To the extent the Interim
NOL Adjustment Amount is greater than the Closing NOL Adjustment Amount, Actua
shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent an amount equal to such difference
by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5)
Business Days following the date such second NOL Statement is received by
Parent. To the extent the Interim NOL Adjustment Amount is less than the
Closing NOL Adjustment Amount, Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Actua
Holdings (or its designee) an amount equal to such difference by wire transfer
of immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business Days following
the date such second NOL Statement is received by Parent.

 



 

(c) No later than October 31, 2018, Actua shall deliver to Parent a third NOL
Statement with an updated good faith estimate of the NOL Amount (the "
**Adjusted NOL Amount** ") and a third Closing NOL Adjustment Amount based
thereon (such revised amount, the " **Post-Closing NOL Adjustment Amount** ")
together with reasonable supporting documentation. Parent shall notify Actua
in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days if Parent objects to one or more
items reflected in the third NOL Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
presence of any data or information in the initial NOL Statement delivered
under _Section 8.03(a)_ or the second NOL Statement delivered under _Section
8.03(b)_ is irrelevant to Parents right to object to any items in the third
NOL Statement, and Parents objection right is not limited to items related to
an update or revision. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If Actua and Parent are unable to resolve any such dispute
within twenty (20) Business Days following Actuas receipt of Parents written
objection, such dispute shall be resolved by the Settlement Accountants. The
Settlement Accountants NOL Statement (with the Adjusted NOL Amount) and Post-
Closing NOL Adjustment Amount shall be deemed final and shall not be subject
to further review, absent fraud or willful neglect. The fees and expenses of

 



       
 

 



 

the Settlement Accountants for this task shall be borne equally by Actua, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. If Parent does not notify Actua
within fifteen (15) Business Days of Parents receipt of the revised NOL
Statement, the revised NOL Statement delivered to Parent shall be deemed final
and shall not be subject to further review, absent fraud or willful neglect.
To the extent the Post-Closing NOL Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Interim NOL Adjustment Amount, Actua shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent
an amount equal to such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than five (5) Business Days following the date such third NOL
Statement is deemed final. To the extent the Post-Closing NOL Adjustment
Amount is less than the Interim NOL Adjustment Amount, Parent shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Actua Holdings (or its designee) an amount equal to such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five
(5) Business Days following the date such third NOL Statement is deemed final.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) neither the Closing
NOL Adjustment Amount, the Interim NOL Adjustment Amount nor the Post-Closing
NOL Adjustment Amount shall exceed $11,290,174 and (ii) any amounts owed to
Parent in respect of the Post-Closing NOL Adjustment Amount shall be reduced
by any amounts owed by Parent under _Section 8.01(f)_.

 



 

(e) Payments under this _Section 8.03_ shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to Purchase Price for income tax purposes.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Aggregate Merger Consideration Adjustment And Interest. _Any
amount paid under _Article 10_ of this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law.

set forth in this Agreement, including the definition of "Material Contracts."

 



 

Section 10.03. _Procedures_ _._

 



 

(a) The party seeking indemnification under this _Article 10_ (the "
**Indemnified Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party
against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third party (a " **Third-Party Claim** ") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under such section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances of such Third-Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification in respect thereof (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure of the Indemnified Party to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure has prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 10.03_, have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so elect to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party and
shall not constitute indemnifiable Damages hereunder unless (i) the employment
of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Partys counsel, the representation of both the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional conduct.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any Third-
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.03_, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim, if
the settlement (A) does not release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
(B) imposes injunctive, equitable relief or any obligation on the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates other than solely the payment of money damages
for which the Indemnified Party will be fully indemnified hereunder, (C)
involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing or violation of Applicable Law
by the Indemnified Party, (D) encumbers the assets of the Indemnified Party or

 



      
 

 



 

imposes any restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect
the Indemnified Party or (E) reasonably could be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Taxes of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates for a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(e) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under this
_Article 10_ against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-
Party Claim (a " **Direct Claim** "), the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of such Direct
Claim and the basis for indemnification in respect thereof (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure
of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(f) To the extent anything in this _Section 10.03_ is inconsistent with
_Section 8.01(e)_, the provisions of _Section 8.01(e)_ shall govern with
respect to any Tax Contest.

 



 

Section 10.04. _Calculation of Damages. _The amount of any Damages payable
under _Article 10_ of this Agreement by the Indemnifying Party shall be (a)
net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies (other than any amounts recovered under the RandW Policy) or
from any other Person, pursuant to indemnity, contribution or similar
agreements with respect to such Damages, alleged to be responsible for such
Damages, which recoveries the Indemnified Party agrees to use reasonable
efforts to obtain (taking into account the effort necessary to pursue such
recovery and any adverse consequences resulting, or reasonably expected to
result, from such pursuit to such Indemnified Party), (b) reduced by refund,
current reduction or reduction within two (2) years following the year the
applicable Damages were paid in cash Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party as
a result of such Damages, and (c) reduced to the extent that the amount of
such Damages was reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital. If
the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies
or from any other Person, pursuant to indemnity, contribution or similar
agreements with respect to such Damages, alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, as a refund or current reduction in cash Taxes payable, or through
the calculation of Closing Working Capital, in each case subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made to such
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by such Indemnified Party,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

 



 

Section 10.05. _Exclusivity._ Except as specifically set forth in, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section 13.12_),
from and after the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, the rights of Parent Indemnified Parties and the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties under _Article 8_ and _Article 10_ of this Agreement shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies for any matter arising under, out of or relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
_Section 10.05_), the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply in the
case of fraud and shall not affect in any way the rights of the parties under
_Section 13.12_.

 



 

ARTICLE 11

Section 11.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

(d) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other if any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ of this Agreement has become
incapable of fulfillment on or prior to the End Date and such condition or
conditions shall not have been waived by such party, except that no party may
terminate this Agreement if the inability to satisfy a condition is the result
of a breach of this Agreement by such party seeking to terminate this
Agreement;

 



 

(e) by Parent, if there has been a misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
breach of covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement by the
Company that would cause the condition set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ or
_Section 9.02(b)_ of this Agreement not to be satisfied, such
misrepresentation or breach is not waived by Parent, and the Company is not
capable of curing such misrepresentation or breach prior to the End Date;

 



 

(f) by the Company, if there has been a misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or breach of covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement
by Parent that would cause the condition set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or
_Section 9.03(b)_ of this Agreement not to be satisfied, such
misrepresentation or breach is not waived by the Company, and Parent is not
capable of curing such misrepresentation or breach prior to the End Date;

 



       
 

 



 

(g) by Parent, if the Company shall not have delivered to Parent a certified
copy of the duly executed Written Consent within twenty (24) hours after
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto; and

 



 

(h) after January 2, 2018, by the Company, upon written notice to Parent if
the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ of this Agreement other
than _Section 9.02(j)_ have all been satisfied (or waived) (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the ability to immediately satisfy those conditions on the date of
the notice delivered by the Company hereunder) and the Closing Date does not
occur within two (2) Business Days of receipt by Parent of such termination
notice.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.01(b)_, _Section 11.01(c)_, _Section 11.01(d)_, _Section 11.01(e)_,
_Section 11.01(f)_, _Section 11.01(g)_ or _Section 11.01(h)_ shall give
written notice of such termination to the other party and the party desiring
to terminate this Agreement may not so terminate this Agreement if such party
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by _Section 11.01_ above, such termination shall be without
liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; _provided_ _, however,_ that if such termination shall result from
the willful and material failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or perform a covenant of
this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such willful and
material failure or breach; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such termination
is by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.01(h)_, Parent shall promptly (and
in any event within five Business Days) pay to the Company the Termination
Fee. The parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee in such event
does not constitute a penalty and that the Companys damages from such
termination of this Agreement would be difficult to determine and the
Termination Fee is a fair estimate of those damages. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) in the event the Company shall receive the Termination Fee, the
receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with such
termination (and any matter forming the basis for such termination) and (ii)
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders, or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability under or with respect to this
Agreement following termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.01(h)_. The provisions of this _Section 11.02_ and _Sections 6.01_
(Confidentiality), _13.01_ (Notices), _13.04_ (Expenses), _13.06_ (Governing
Law), _13.07_ (Jurisdiction) and _13.08_ (Waiver of Jury Trial) shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 11.01_ of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE 12 
REPRESENTATIVE

 



 

Section 12.01. _Designation and Replacement of Representative_. The
Stockholders have designated the Representative as the initial representative
of the Stockholders. The Representative may resign at any time, and
Representative may be removed by the vote of the Stockholder(s) who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, held a majority of the Fully-

 



      
 

 



 

Diluted Shares (" **Majority Holders** "). In the event that a Representative
has resigned or been removed, a new Representative shall be appointed by a
vote of Majority Holders, with such appointment to become effective upon the
written acceptance thereof by the new Representative.

 



 

Section 12.02. _Authority and Rights of Representative; Limitations on
Liability_.

 



 

(a) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Required Stockholder Approval or acceptance of any Aggregate Merger
Consideration hereunder shall constitute the grant to the Representative of
the full power and authority, to act as agent and attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution to act in the name, place and of each Stockholders
stead with respect to the transactions contemplated by, and all the terms and
provisions of, this Agreement and to act on such Stockholders behalf in any
dispute or Proceeding involving this Agreement and to do or refrain from doing
all such further acts and things, and execute all such agreements,
certificates, instruments or other documents, as the Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the power to (i) execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and Payment Agent Agreement (in each case, with such modifications
or changes therein as to which the Representative, in its sole discretion,
shall have consented) and, in each case, to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines to be desirable, (ii) interpret the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the documents to be executed and delivered in connection
herewith, including _Article 10_, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment Agent
Agreement, (iii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment Agent Agreement, (iv) receive
service of process in connection with any claims under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Payment Agent Agreement, (v) agree to negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, assume the defense of claims, demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
sole judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing,
including taking all such actions as may be necessary under _Article 10_,
(vi) give and receive notices and communications, (vii) authorize delivery to
Parent of funds from the Escrow Account or any portion thereof in satisfaction
of claims brought by Parent for Damages, (viii) receive and distribute the
consideration payable hereunder, including payments from the Escrow Account
and any earnings and proceeds thereon, and (ix) take all actions (or refrain
from taking actions) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Representative as agent for and on behalf of the Stockholders in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Payment Agent Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders
except as expressly provided herein or in an agreement to be entered into
among the Representative and the Stockholders. In connection with the carrying
out of its duties, the Representative shall have the full and complete
authority to incur expenses and engage outside counsel and advisors, and shall
be entitled to reimbursement of such expenses. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
the Surviving Corporation may conclusively rely upon, without independent
verification or investigation, all decisions made by the Representative in
connection with this Agreement in writing and signed

 



      
 

 



 

by an officer of the Representative. The Representative shall have no
liability to the Company, the Stockholders, Parent or Merger Subsidiary with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Representative, except with respect to liability directly resulting from the
Representatives willful misconduct and knowing violation of the laws or this
Agreement. The Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
**Representative Losses** ") arising out of or in connection with the
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement, the Payment
Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred, _provided_ that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
willful misconduct and knowing violation of the laws or this Agreement of the
Representative, the Representative will reimburse the Stockholders the amount
of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such bad
faith or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative by the
Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Representative from (i) the funds in the Representative Fund and (ii) the
amounts in the Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Stockholders, _provided_ that while this
_Section 12.02_ allows the Representative to be paid from the Representative
Fund and the Escrow Account, it does not relieve the Stockholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Stockholders or otherwise.
The Stockholders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will
survive the resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.03. _Representative Fund_. Representative shall use the
Representative Fund to pay directly, or reimburse the Representative for, all
third party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
Representative, in its capacity as such, including all costs and expenses
incurred by the Representative in connection with any pending or threatened
dispute or claim with respect to this Agreement, any agreement, document or
instrument entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or reasonably related to
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in its sole discretion. The
Stockholders shall not receive any interest or earnings on the Representative
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Representative shall not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Representative Fund other than as a result of its willful and knowing
violation of the laws or this Agreement. The Representative shall hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, shall not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and shall not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following the completion of the
Representatives duties, the Representative shall deliver the balance of the
Representative Fund to the Payment Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with their Allocable Percentages. The
Representative Fund shall be held or disbursed, in whole or in part, as
determined by the Representative. The retention by the Representative of any
amounts in the Representative Fund shall not be used as evidence that
Stockholders have any liability hereunder.

Section 13.03. _Disclosure Schedule References. _The representations and
warranties contained in _Article 3_ are qualified by reference to the Company
Disclosure Schedules. The parties agree that the disclosures set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedules are not intended to constitute, and shall not be

as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledge that (a) the Company Disclosure Schedules may include
items or information which the Company is not required to disclose under this
Agreement, (b) the inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to the Company or is required to be

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed under this Agreement, (c) headings have been inserted on the
individual schedules included in the Company Disclosure Schedules for the
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or

transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the

construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in Delaware Chancery Court or, if such

Delaware or other Delaware state court, so long as one of such courts shall
have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and
that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party

HEREBY.

 



 

Section 13.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto, which may be transmitted by facsimile machine or by
electronic mail or transmission and any partys signature appearing on a faxed
or electronically transmitted copy of this Agreement or any other document
entered into in connection herewith shall be treated as an original signature
for all purposes under Applicable Law, including for admission into evidence
in any legal proceeding. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have
no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether
by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).
Except for the provisions of _Section 6.04_ and _Article 10_ of this
Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 13.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Payment Agent Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Representative

subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.11. _Severability. _If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 13.12. _Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in the courts set forth in _Section 13.07_ of this Agreement, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 13.13. _No Conflict_. Each of the parties (a) hereby confirms that no
engagement that Dechert LLP has undertaken or may undertake on behalf of the
Company, the Representative or any of their respective current or former
equityholders or Affiliates will be

 



      
 

 



 

asserted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Subsidiary or
Parent as a conflict of interest with respect to, or as a basis to preclude,
challenge or otherwise disqualify Dechert LLP from, any current or future
representation of the Surviving Corporation, the Representative or any of
their respective current or former equityholders or Affiliates, and (b) hereby
waives any conflict of interest that exists on or prior to the Effective Time,
or that might be asserted to exist after the Effective Time, and any other
basis that might be asserted to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify
Dechert LLP in any representation of the Surviving Corporation, the
Representative or any of their respective current or former equityholders or
Affiliates with respect to any such matter.

 



 

Section 13.14. _No Waiver of Privilege; Protection from Disclosure or Use.
_Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any attorney-
client privilege, work product protection, or other protection from disclosure
or use. The parties have undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the
disclosure of any information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure or use but, notwithstanding
such efforts, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement could result in the inadvertent disclosure of such information. The
parties agree that any such inadvertent disclosure of information that may be
confidential, subject to a claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from
disclosure or use will not constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any
claim of confidentiality, privilege, or protection from disclosure, and
further agree to use reasonable best efforts to return any inadvertently
disclosed information to the disclosing party promptly upon becoming aware of
its existence. Promptly following the return of any inadvertently disclosed
information, the party returning such information shall destroy any and all
copies, summaries, descriptions, or notes of such inadvertently disclosed
information, including electronic versions thereof, and all portions of larger
documents or communications that contain such copies, summaries, descriptions,
or notes.

 



 

Section 13.15. _Transaction Privileged Communications. _Parent agrees, on
behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on behalf of Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, that all communications in any form or format whatsoever
between or among Dechert, LLP and/or any other legal counsel to the
Representative (including, in-house legal counsel) (each a " **Counsel** "),
on the one hand, and the Company or any of its directors, officers, employees
or other representatives, on the other hand, to the extent the same relate to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the " **Privileged Communications** ") shall be deemed to be
attorney-client privileged and that the Privileged Communications and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Representative, shall be controlled by the Representative on behalf of the
Stockholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party (other than Representative in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), on the other
hand, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged
Communications to such third party.

Actua Corporation hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to Parent and
its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of
this Agreement or the obligations of the Stockholder hereunder, that any
Damages claimed pursuant to (a), if a RandW Policy is not bound at or prior to
Closing, _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ of this Agreement, (b) _Section 10.02(a)(v)_
and (c) _Section 10.02(a)(vii)_ of this Agreement will be promptly paid in
full when due. Failing payment when due of any such amount so guaranteed or
any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, Actua Corporation will be
jointly and severally obligated with the Stockholders obligated thereunder to
pay the same immediately. Actua Corporation further: (i) agrees that this is a
guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection; (ii) agrees that its
obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any
action to enforce the payment obligations of the Stockholders hereunder; (iii)
hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with
a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of any Stockholder, any right
to require a proceeding first against any Stockholder, protest, notice and all
demands whatsoever and covenant that guarantee will not be discharged except
by complete performance of the indemnification obligations contained _Article
10_ in respect of Covered Matters (if and only if a RandW Policy is not bound at
or prior to Closing), Sales Taxes or Section 7.09 Damages, as applicable; and
(iv) agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in
