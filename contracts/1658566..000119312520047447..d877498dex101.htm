Seller shall provide Buyer written wire transfer instructions for payment of
the Closing Amount, and the Parties shall settle on the contents of the

Parties cannot agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to such
time, the Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented by Seller will be used
to adjust the Base Purchase Price at Closing. The Preliminary Settlement

with respect thereto) incurred with respect to the Assets for the period
prior to the Effective Time shall be the obligation of and shall be paid by

be paid by Buyer. "Earned" and "incurred," as used in this Agreement, shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, except as otherwise

(c) If monies are received by any Party which, under the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ belong to the other Party, the Preliminary Settlement
Statement or Final Settlement Statements, as applicable, will be adjusted
accordingly. If an invoice or other evidence of an obligation is received
which, under the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, is partially the
obligation of more than one Party, then the Parties shall consult each other,
and the Preliminary Settlement Statement or Final Settlement Statements, as
applicable, will be adjusted accordingly. In the event any adjustments are
required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ that cannot be incorporated
into the Preliminary Settlement Statement or Final Settlement Statement, each
Party shall promptly pay the other Party its portion of any amounts owed.

(d) Seller shall be responsible for processing and paying any and all invoices
with respect to the Assets relating to service dates occurring in any period
that begins prior to the Effective Time and ends on or after the Effective
Time (a " _Straddle Period Invoice_ "). Seller shall aggregate the Straddle
Period Invoices and invoice Buyer for its proportionate share of such
Straddle Period Invoices (such aggregate invoice to include reasonable
supporting documentation) on or before the 20th day of each month, and Buyer
shall pay invoiced amounts within fifteen (15) days from receipt of such
invoice.

Section 2.5  _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct or withhold any
amounts Buyer is required to deduct or withhold pursuant to any applicable Law
in connection with payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Such amounts deducted or withheld shall be treated for all

Environmental Consultant to keep, such report or assessment confidential and
furnish copies thereof (including any and all drafts) to Seller within one
week of receipt thereof by Buyer.

TITLE MATTERS

 

Section 4.1 _No Title Representations or Warranties_. Except for _Section_ __
_ 6.14_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.15 _and as expressly set forth in any other
Transaction Document, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory, common law, or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title
to any of the Assets.

Section 4.2 _Preferential Rights and Consents_. No later than 5:00 pm Mountain
time on the date that is 15 Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller
shall (a) deliver notices to the applicable Persons holding Consents (other
than Customary Post-Closing Consents) requesting that the holders of such
Consents grant their consent to the Transaction, and (b) deliver notices to
the applicable Persons required in connection with any applicable preferential
rights to purchase any Assets that are triggered by the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction, all such preferential
rights to purchase any Assets or portion thereof being set forth on Section
6.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, in the case of each of _clause (a)_ and _(b)_
, in accordance with the applicable agreements and contracts creating such
Consents or preferential rights to purchase, as applicable. Seller shall use
Reasonable Efforts to obtain all Consents (other than Customary Post-Closing
Consents) prior to Closing. Prior to Closing, if Buyer discovers other Assets
affected by Consents (other than Customary Post-Closing Consents) or
preferential rights to purchase, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly, and
Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain such Consents and/or to give the
notices required in connection with such preferential rights to purchase
prior to Closing.

(a) _Consents_. To the extent not obtained as of the Execution Date, Seller
shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain all Required Consents prior to Closing
and shall pay all reasonable expenses to do so. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, if a Required Consent has not been obtained
as of Closing or any other Consent is denied in writing with respect to any
Asset (a " _Restricted Asset_ "), the Closing shall not be delayed due to
failure to obtain any such Consent, and such Restricted Asset shall be
excluded from the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and upon the Closing,
such Restricted Asset shall be deemed to be held by Seller at all times during
the Holding Period for the benefit of Buyer in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_. During the Holding Period, Seller shall use
Reasonable Efforts (and Buyer shall assist Seller as reasonably requested) to
provide Buyer with the economic benefits and risks of ownership of the
Restricted Asset and to obtain the Consent of the third Persons related to
such Restricted Asset and shall pay the reasonable expenses to do so and shall
not agree to a throughput fee or increase in royalty or other expenses to be
borne by Buyer without Buyers prior written consent. If the Restricted Asset
is an easement or similar right, then the term Restricted Asset shall include
the portion of any other associated Assets located thereon. With respect to
any such Restricted Asset as to which the necessary approval or consent for
the assignment or transfer to Buyer is obtained or waived by the holder
thereof following Closing, then promptly (but in no event later than 10
Business Days) after the date such approval, consent, or waiver is obtained
(i) for no additional consideration, the Parties shall execute and deliver all
documents and take all such actions with respect to such Restricted Asset
required under _Article XIII_ , with any necessary conforming changes and
(ii) such Restricted Assets shall be deemed to constitute Assets under this
Agreement for all purposes and shall not constitute Excluded Assets. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Holding Period_ ," for any particular
Restricted Asset, shall mean the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the earlier of (x) the date upon which the applicable Material
Contract or Surface Agreement for which the Consent was not obtained prior
to Closing expires or otherwise

 



6

    

 terminates and (y) the date upon which such Consent or an alternative
arrangement is obtained on terms that are substantially similar in operational
and economic effects as the assignment of the Restricted Asset to Buyer;
_provided that_ Sellers obligation to use its Reasonable Efforts to obtain
Consents associated with Restricted Asset shall expire on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. Further, with respect to any Surface
Agreements that the Parties intend to partially assign to Buyer hereunder, if
Seller is unable to effectuate such assignment at Closing, then from and after
Closing the Parties agree to use Reasonable Efforts to obtain separate
agreements for each such Surface Agreement providing each Party the rights
contemplated in this Agreement at no additional cost or expense to Buyer.

 

(b) _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(1) If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is
exercised and the sale to such preferential right holder closes prior to the
Closing Date, then that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential
right to purchase shall be excluded from the Assets at Closing and deemed to
constitute an Excluded Asset, and the Base Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected
Assets (the aggregate value of all such adjustments, the " _Exclusion
Adjustment_ ").

 

(2) If (i) any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is not
exercised prior to the Closing Date, or if such right is exercised prior to
the Closing Date but the closing of such sale will not happen prior to the
Closing Date, then in each such case, Seller shall convey such Asset to Buyer
at Closing without any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price and such Asset
shall constitute a part of the Assets for all purposes hereunder; or (ii) a
preferential right to purchase is not discovered prior to Closing and the
affected Asset is conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and the preferential right
to purchase is exercised after Closing, then in each such case, Buyer agrees
to convey such affected Asset to the party exercising such right on the same
terms and conditions under which Seller conveyed such Asset to Buyer (with the
purchase price being the Allocated Value for the affected Asset) as adjusted
under _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and such other adjustments as may be permitted to
reflect any other post-Closing expenditures Buyer has made with respect to
such Asset, and Buyer shall retain all amounts paid by the party exercising
such preferential right to purchase. Promptly following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare, execute, and deliver a form of purchase and sale
agreement and conveyance of such Asset to such exercising party, such
purchase and sale agreement and conveyance to be in form and substance as
provided in this Agreement. Seller will reimburse all costs incurred by Buyer
in complying with this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(2)_. 

(c) _Creditworthiness_. If the holder of any Consent (including the Required
Consents) set forth on Section 6.8 of the Disclosure Schedule requires that
the Buyer deliver proof of its creditworthiness for the approval of such
Consent, then the Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to deliver to such holder
any and all reasonably requested credit information or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects, or creditworthiness of Buyer, subject to the holder of
such Consent entering into a confidentiality agreement.

ARTICLE V

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 5.1 _Environmental Procedures_.

 

(a) _Use of Environmental Consultant_. Buyer will have until the Defect Notice
Date to conduct an investigation of the environmental condition of the
Assets, which investigation shall be subject to the limitations in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_. Should Buyer elect to conduct such an investigation, Buyer will
have the right to employ a qualified, independent third Person environmental
consultant reasonably selected by Buyer (the " _Environmental Consultant_ ")
to determine the existence of any Environmental Defects and for the
Remediation Costs, if any, associated therewith.

(b) _Environmental Defect Notice_. To assert any alleged Environmental Defect,
Buyer must, on or before the Defect Notice Date, deliver to Seller one or
more Environmental Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver Environmental Defect
Notices as soon as reasonably practical, but no later than on the Defect
Notice Date. The Environmental Defect Notice must (i) be in writing and
asserted in good faith, (ii) name or describe the affected Asset(s), (iii)
include a description of the condition in, on, or under the Asset that
constitutes, causes, or contributes to each Environmental Defect, (iv)
provide factual substantiation for each Environmental Defect, and (v) state
Buyers good faith estimate (with reasonable supporting detail, including a
description of the Remediation proposed) of the Remediation
Costs attributable to each Environmental Defect. For the purpose of the
preceding sentence, "factual substantiation for each Environmental Defect"
means reports prepared by the Environmental Consultant. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer
agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of all alleged
Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
expiration of the Defect Notice Date. Buyer irrevocably waives all
Environmental Defects not submitted on or before the Defect Notice Date. 

(c) _Remedies_. Following the Closing, Seller shall have the right to further
remediate any existing Environmental Defects until no later than forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date (the " _Cure Period_ "), provided that Seller
must provide to Buyer prior notice of such Remediation efforts and the
opportunity to observe such Remediation efforts, together with such
information regarding such Remediation efforts reasonably requested by Buyer,
and such remediation efforts of Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with
Buyers operations. __Subject to (i) Sellers right to dispute the existence
of an Environmental Defect or the Remediation Costs asserted with respect
thereto, in which case the Parties shall follow the procedures in _Section_ __
_ 5.2_, (ii) Sellers right to terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _
12.1_ due to the failure of the condition precedent under _Section_ __ _
11.1(c)_, (iii) the Environmental Deductible, and (iv) Sellers right to cure
during the Cure Period, if any Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer under
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured prior to
Closing, then the Base Purchase Price will be reduced by an amount equal to
(1) the Parties agreement on the estimated Remediation Cost of each such
Environmental Defect or (2) if the Parties are unable to agree on the
estimated Remediation Cost of each such Environmental Defect, Buyers good
faith estimate of the cost of remediation of such Environmental Defect, and
the Assets will be conveyed subject to such Environmental Defect to Buyer at
Closing (the aggregate amount of all such reductions to the Base Purchase
Price under this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_, the " _Environmental Defect
Adjustment_ "). If at the expiration of the Cure Period, Seller has failed to
cure to Buyers reasonable satisfaction an Environmental Defect that Seller
elected to cure pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_, the remaining Remediation
Cost, after crediting Seller for any reasonable, out-of-pocket Remediation
Costs incurred prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, associated with
such uncured Environmental Defect shall be credited to Buyer in the Final
Settlement Statement.

(d) _Environmental Defect Threshold and Environmental Deductible_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no
event shall there be any remedies provided by Seller, and Seller shall not be
responsible for any Environmental Defect with respect to which the Remediation
Costs exceed the Environmental Defect Threshold, unless and until the
aggregate of all such Remediation Costs that exceed the Environmental Defect
Threshold (taking into account the full amount of such Remediation Costs and
not just the amount that exceeds the Environmental Defect Threshold), exceeds
an amount equal to the Environmental Deductible, and then only with respect to
the amount of such Remediation Costs that exceed the Environmental Deductible.

 



8

    

Section 5.2 _Contested Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) _Rejection Notice_. If Seller in good faith contests the existence or the
scope of an Environmental Defect or the asserted Remediation Costs associated
with such Environmental Defect, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing on or
before the day that is five Business Days after the Defect Notice Date ("
_Rejection Notice_ "). The Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable
specificity the basis for the rejection of the Environmental Defect(s) or the
Remediation Costs. Within five Business Days of receipt of the Rejection
Notice, representatives of Buyer and Seller knowledgeable in
environmental matters shall meet in good faith and agree to either (i) reject
the particular Environmental Defect(s) or (ii) accept the validity of such
Environmental Defect(s) and the Remediation Costs. If the Parties cannot in
good faith agree on either options (i) or (ii) in the preceding sentence with
respect to each challenged Environmental Defect, the Environmental Defect(s)
and/or the Remediation Costs subject to the Rejection Notice or the Parties
cannot in good faith resolve Disputes relating to the adequacy of Sellers
Remediation efforts with respect to an Environmental Defect (the "
_Environmental Disputed Matters_ "), such Environmental Disputed Matters shall
be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the arbitration
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ or by agreement of the
Parties.

 

(b) _Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Procedure_. Any Diligence Dispute will be
finally determined under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_.

(1) In the event of any Diligence Dispute, management representatives of
the Parties with direct authority to enter into a settlement agreement shall
meet and make a good faith effort to resolve any Diligence Dispute. In the
event the management representatives are unable to resolve any Diligence
Dispute within 30 days after commencement of the meetings to resolve such
Diligence Dispute, then either Party may submit all remaining Diligence
Disputes to a mutually agreed expert to resolve such Diligence Dispute (such
individual, the " _Arbitrator_ "), and absent such agreement, formally apply
to the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to choose
the Arbitrator and submit such Diligence Dispute along with such application.
The Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside consultant for
any Party or its Affiliates during the ten-year period preceding the
arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute other than the
payment of the Arbitrators fees and expenses incurred as Arbitrator.

(2) The arbitration proceeding for any Diligence Dispute shall be held in
Houston, Texas, and shall be conducted in accordance with Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_. The
Arbitrators determination shall be made within 45 days after submission by
the Parties of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or her determination, the
Arbitrator shall be bound by the applicable rules set forth in this _Article
V_ with respect to Environmental Disputed Matters and the applicable rules set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ with respect to Disputed CLIF Matters, and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion
of the Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Arbitrator
may consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator, however, may not render a decision with respect
to an Environmental Defect or Remediation Cost, in each case, in excess of the
highest value for such Environmental Disputed Matter adjustment as claimed by
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, or below the lowest value for such
Environmental Disputed Matter adjustment as claimed by Seller or Buyer,

 



9

    

 as applicable. The Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose
of determining a resolution to the specific Diligence Dispute submitted by
either Party and may not award damages, interest, or penalties to either
Party with respect to any Diligence Dispute. Promptly, but in no event later
than five Business Days, after the Arbitrator renders its decision as to all
Diligence Disputes and assuming Closing has occurred, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
Remediation Costs as determined by the Arbitrator (and further subject to the
application of the Environmental Defect Threshold and
Environmental Deductible, as provided in _Article V_ ). Each of Seller and
Buyer shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to
the Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Arbitrator.

Section 5.3 _Physical Condition of the Assets_. Without limiting
Buyers rights and remedies under this Agreement or any Transaction Document,
Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the transportation,
storage and disposal of Hydrocarbons, saltwater, Hazardous Substances, or
other substances related to standard oil field operations. The Assets also
may contain buried pipelines, water treating and water transportation
equipment, storage tanks, and other equipment, whether or not of a similar
nature, the locations of which may not now be known by Seller or be readily
apparent by a physical inspection of the Assets.

under, any Law applicable to Seller or by which Seller is bound, other than,
in the case of the matters described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, where such matters would not, reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Seller to consummate the Transaction.

 



10

    

Section 6.4 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution, delivery, and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is or will be a party and the Transaction have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has
been (and all other Transaction Documents to which Seller is or will be a
party and all other documents required under this Agreement to be executed and
delivered by Seller at Closing will be) duly executed and delivered by Seller,
and this Agreement constitutes, and at Closing the other Transaction
Documents to which Seller is or will be a party and such other documents will

to Sellers Knowledge, threatened insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
receivership or similar proceedings of any character. Seller has not made a
broad assignment of substantially all of its assets for the benefit of
creditors or taken any action with a view to or that could constitute a valid
basis for the institution of any such proceedings. As used in this _Section_
__ _ 6.6_, "insolvent" means that the sum of the present fair saleable value

Operated Assets in connection with the Transaction.

 

Section 6.9 _Material Contracts_.

 

(a) Section 6.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all Material Contracts affecting the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets. True
and complete copies of all such Material Contracts (including all amendments
and modifications thereto) have been Made Available to Buyer. To the Knowledge
of Seller, all Material Contracts affecting the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets are
legal, valid, binding on, and enforceable against, in accordance with their
respective terms, Seller and each other party to such Material
Contracts. Seller is not in breach of, or default under, and to the Knowledge
of Seller, except as disclosed on Section 6.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule,
__ no other Person is in breach of, or default under, any such Material
Contracts, and there does not exist under any provision thereof any event
that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute

Section 6.10 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) Except as disclosed on Section 6.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, to
Sellers Knowledge, Sellers ownership and operation of the Non-Buyer-
Operated Assets is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions and requirements of all Laws (except with respect
to compliance with or matters related to Environmental Laws, which are
addressed in _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and _Article V_ , and compliance with Laws
concerning Taxes, which are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 6.12_) of all
Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction with respect to such Assets. To
Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred, nor does any circumstance exist
(with or without notice or passage of time or both) that (i) would reasonably
be expected to constitute or result in a material violation by Seller of, or
a failure on the part of Seller to comply with, any applicable Law applicable
to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets, or (ii) would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any obligation under applicable Law on the part of Seller to
undertake or perform, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any
remedial action or measure of any nature with respect to the Non-Buyer-
Operated Assets. Except as disclosed on Section 6.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, Seller has not received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person regarding any (A) actual, alleged or potential
violation of, or failure to comply with, any applicable Law in connection with
the operation of the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets, or (B) actual, alleged or
potential obligation under applicable law on the part of Seller to undertake
or perform, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action
or measure of any nature in connection with the operation of the Non-Buyer-
Operated Assets.

(b) Section 6.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of each Permit held by Seller (the " _Held Permits_ ") and Permit
applications submitted by or on behalf of Seller (the " _Pending Permits_ "),
in each case that are primarily used or held for use in connection with the
Non-Buyer-Operated Assets. True, complete and correct copies of each such
Permit have been provided to Buyer. Seller is in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of such Permits and each Permit is valid and in
force. The Held Permits constitute all material Permits necessary to own,
operate and maintain the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets in the manner currently
operated. None of Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received any written
notice from a Governmental Authority that (i) concerns any default or
violation of Seller with respect to any Held Permit, (ii) claims that the
application for any Pending Permit is invalid or deficient or (iii) threatens
to impose any material restriction or condition upon the approval of any
Pending Permit.

 

Section 6.11 _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth on Section 6.11 of
the Disclosure Schedule:

 

(a) Seller is not the subject of any pending Order that remains unsatisfied
under any Environmental Law applicable to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets
requiring Remediation or the payment of a fine or penalty;

(b) Seller has not entered into any agreements, consents, orders, decrees,
judgments, or other directives of or with any Governmental Authorities based
on any prior violations of Environmental Laws that relate to the future use of
any of the Assets and that require any Remediation;

 



12

    

(c) Seller has not received any written notice from any Governmental Authority
or other Person, nor is subject to any pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened, claim, demand, proceeding, or complaint (i) alleging, with respect
to any such party, the violation of or liability under any Environmental Law
applicable to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets or (ii) requesting, with respect
to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets, information with respect to an investigation
pursuant to any Environmental Law;

(d) to Sellers Knowledge, there has been no release of any Hazardous
Substances from or in connection with the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets required
to be reported to an applicable Governmental Authority; and

(e) Seller has provided or Made Available to Buyer true and complete copies
of all third Person environmental site assessments or similar reports and any
written complaints, violation notices or other notices of liability or alleged
violation related, in each case, to Environmental Laws, in Sellers control
or possession that are related to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets, a list of
which such reports, assessments, orders, decrees and notices is set forth on
Section 6.11(e) of the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 6.12 _Tax Matters_. For all taxable periods during Sellers period of
ownership through the taxable period in which this Agreement is executed, all
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets
that have become due and payable (whether or not shown or required to be
shown on any Tax Return) have been paid when due, unless contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings. There are no liens of any Governmental
Authorities for Taxes on Sellers interests in any of the Assets except for
Permitted Encumbrances. Seller has timely filed with appropriate Governmental
Authorities all Tax Returns and reports required to be filed by Seller in
connection with its ownership or operation of the Assets. All such Tax Returns
and reports were correct and complete in all material respects. No Tax
Returns filed by Seller with respect to Asset Taxes are now under audit or
examination, or subject to any other Tax-related proceeding currently being
conducted, by any Governmental Authority. Seller is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return with
respect to Asset Taxes. All Tax withholding and deposit obligations imposed on
Seller by applicable Law with respect to Asset Taxes have been satisfied in
all material respects. Seller is not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
arrangement which will survive the Closing and be binding on Buyer. There is
no ongoing dispute or claim concerning any Asset Tax liability of Seller
claimed or raised or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened by any
Governmental Authority in writing, and to Sellers Knowledge, no event has
occurred nor does any circumstance exist that with or without notice or the
passage of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to result in such a
claim or dispute. Seller has not waived any statute of limitations in respect
of Asset Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Asset
Tax assessment or deficiency where, in each case, such waiver or extension is
still in effect. No written claim that has not been resolved has been made by
a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where Seller does not file Tax Returns that
the Assets are or may be subject to taxation in such jurisdiction. None of
the Assets is subject to any tax partnership as defined in Section 761 of the
Code or as defined for any state or local Tax purposes.

 

Section 6.13 _Capital Projects_. As of the Execution Date, Section 6.13 of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a list and description of all Wells or other
capital projects in progress and associated costs or estimates thereof to the
extent such costs or estimates as of the Execution Date exceed $100,000.00
individually or exceed $250,000.00 in the aggregate for any series of related
transactions per Well or project, net to Sellers interest (the " _Capital
Projects_ "). Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list and
description of all other authorities for expenditures or other current
commitments relating to the Non-Buyer-Operated Assets to drill or rework
wells, build gathering systems, or for other capital expenditures (" _AFEs_ ")
that, in each case, are outstanding as of the Execution Date and not expected
to be completed by the Closing Date, in each case that Seller reasonably
anticipates will individually require expenditures attributable to periods on
or after the Effective Time, other than any AFEs and Capital Projects
outstanding as of the Execution Date that do not exceed $100,000.00
individually or exceed $250,000.00 in the aggregate for any series of related

The Parties shall agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any,
no later than 60 days after Sellers delivery of the proposed Final Settlement
Statement. The date upon which such agreement is reached or upon which
the Final Purchase Price is established is the " _Final Settlement Date_." If
the Final Purchase Price is more than the sum of the Closing Amount and the
Deposit, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of such difference. If the
Final Purchase Price is less than the sum of the Closing Amount and the
Deposit, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference. Any payment
by a Party under this _Section_ __ _ 14.1(a)_ shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds within five days of the Final Settlement Date.
Subject to and except for the rights and obligations of the Parties described
in _Section_ __ _ 14.1(b)_ or _Article XV_ (with respect to any obligation
related to Taxes), the adjustments set out in the Final Settlement Statement
shall be final settlement of the Parties with respect to all matters addressed
in such Final Settlement Statement.

 

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute as to
the Final Purchase Price by 60 days after Sellers delivery of the proposed
Final Settlement Statement, then either Seller or Buyer may submit the
Disputed matters (other than Diligence Disputes, which disputes are governed
by _Section_ __ _ 5.2_) to be resolved by the Houston, Texas, office of a
nationally-recognized independent accounting firm or consulting firm mutually
acceptable to both Seller and Buyer that neither Seller nor Buyer has
contracted with to perform services in the past five (5) years (the "
_Accounting Referee_ "), for review and final determination by arbitration. If
Seller and Buyer have not agreed upon a mutually acceptable Person to serve as
Accounting Referee within 10 Business Days of commencing discussions to agree
on such Accounting Referee, either Party may, within 10 Business Days after
the end of such initial 10 Business Day period, formally apply to the Houston,
Texas, office of the American Arbitration Association to choose
the Accounting Referee. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas, and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 14.1(b)_. The FAA shall
govern the interpretation, enforcement and proceedings under this _Section_ __
_ 14.1(b)_. The Accounting Referees award shall be made within 30
days after submission by the Parties of the Disputed matters absent an
extension of such deadline for good cause (as determined by such Accounting
Referee in its sole discretion). The award of such Accounting Referee shall be
final and binding upon all Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by the rules set forth in
_Article II_ and this _Section_ __ _ 14.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Accounting Referee are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Accounting Referee, however, may
not render an award with respect to a disputed adjustment, in each case, in
excess of the highest value for such disputed adjustment as claimed by Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, or below the lowest value for such disputed
adjustment as claimed by Seller or Buyer, as applicable. The Accounting
Referee may not otherwise award damages, interest, or penalties to either
Party with respect to any disputed matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting their case to the
Accounting Referee. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one half of the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Referee. Judgment on any award of an Accounting
Referee may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Section 14.2 _Records_. Seller agrees to make all Records (as such
Records exist in their native format as of the Execution Date) available to
Buyer as soon as is reasonably practical, but no later than 30 days after the
Closing. In the event that Buyer requests in writing physical copies of the
Records that are in Sellers or its Affiliates possession in electronic
form, (i) Seller will (and shall cause its Affiliates to) provide physical
copies of such Records to Buyer within 30 days following such request, and
(ii) Buyer shall pay all actual costs incurred by Seller and Sellers
Affiliates in retrieving and transferring such Records. Seller has no duty to
convert any of the electronic records into any file format beyond the native
file format that such Records exist in as of the Execution Date. Seller may
retain copies of the Records and shall have the right to review and copy the
Records during standard business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as
Buyer retains the Records. Buyer shall maintain the Records in compliance
with all applicable Laws governing document retention. Buyer will not destroy
or otherwise dispose of Records within seven years after Closing unless Buyer
first gives Seller reasonable notice and an opportunity to copy the Records to
be destroyed. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller will provide the
Records as they are currently maintained by Seller and Seller shall not have
any obligation to manipulate electronic data or otherwise supply to Buyer the
Records in a format not currently maintained by Seller. In addition, upon
reasonable notice provided to Buyer, Seller shall be entitled to access the
Records, as necessary, for the purposes of complying with its obligations with
respect to the Excluded Assets, the Retained Liabilities, and any other
matter for which Seller must indemnify Buyer.

Section 14.3 _Name Changes_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case
within 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense,
eliminate the name "Centennial Resource Production," "CRP," "Centennial
Resource Development," "CDEV," "Centennial" and any variants thereof from the
Assets and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing
usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks, or trade names
belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 14.4 _Change of Operator_. As promptly as practicable after Closing,
Buyer shall file all change of operator forms executed at Closing with the
applicable Governmental Authorities and shall use its best efforts to ensure
that such change of operator forms are filed promptly after Closing.

 

Section 14.5 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall each execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the other such further
instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested in order
to accomplish more effectively the purposes of the Transaction.

Liabilities. By assuming in the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 15.1_, Seller and Buyer do not intend to admit, and are not

(2) Buyer Taxes;

 

(3) any matter for which Buyer has expressly agreed to indemnify Seller under
this Agreement;

 

(4) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in this Agreement; and

 

(5) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement of Buyer
expressly set forth in this Agreement;

 

provided that this will not relieve Seller of any of its indemnity obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)_ or require Buyer to indemnify Seller for any
Losses to the extent Buyer is entitled to indemnity from Seller under
_Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)_.

(c)  _Release_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have

35

    

Section 15.4 _Limitation on Seller_ __ _s Indemnity Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement, the
following limitations shall apply:

(a)  _Threshold_. Except for any indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.3_ related to Taxes, if a Loss that is the subject of a claim for
indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties does not exceed an amount equal
to $100,000.00 (" _De Minimis Threshold_ ") per event or circumstance, then
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification from Seller
for such Loss.

 

(b) _Deductible_. Except for any indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.3_ related to Taxes or the Fundamental Representations, Seller shall not
have any liability for indemnification to the Buyer Indemnified Parties until
and unless the aggregate amount of all liability for all Losses arising out of
or relating to  _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(2) _that exceed the De Minimis
Threshold (taking into account the full amount of liability for such Losses
and not just the amount that exceeds the De Minimis Threshold) exceeds a
deductible equal to $3,000,000.00 (the " _Indemnity Deductible_ "), after
which point the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim such
Losses solely for the amount in excess of the Indemnity Deductible, subject to
the other limitations set forth in this Agreement.

(c) _Cap_. Except for any indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.3_ related to Taxes or the Fundamental Representations, in no event shall
Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating to _Section_ __ _
15.3(a)(2)_ with respect to a breach by Seller of or any inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement exceed
$30,000,000.00, and in no event shall Sellers aggregate liabilities arising
out of or relating to _Section_ __ _ 15.3_ exceed an amount equal to the
Final Purchase Price.

(d) _Environmental Deductible_. Seller shall not have any liability for
indemnification to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section_ __ _
15.3(a)(4) _unless and until the sum of (i) all liability for all Losses
arising out of or relating to _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(4)_ that exceed the
Environmental Deductible (taking into account the full amount of liability
for such Losses and not just the amount that exceeds the De Minimis Threshold)
plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all Remediation Costs for Environmental
Defects, exceeds the Environmental Deductible, after which point the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim indemnification by Seller for
such Losses solely for the amount in excess of the Environmental Deductible,
subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement.

(e) _Materiality_. __For purposes of determining the amount of Losses (but not
for the purpose of determining whether a particular representation or
warranty has been breached) for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(2)_, as the case may be, each representation and
warranty set forth in this Agreement, and any qualification with respect to
any representation or warranty set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, shall be
read without regard for or giving effect to "material," "materially,"
"material adverse effect," and words of similar qualification. A Partys
knowledge of any particular fact or circumstance at any time will not affect
that Partys right to indemnification hereunder.

 

Section 15.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. EXCEPT (A) AS PROVIDED IN _ARTICLE X_ , (B)
WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, ALL OF WHICH MUST BE ASSERTED BEFORE
THE DEFECT NOTICE DATE OR SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS ARE WAIVED AND SUBJECT TO
AND WITHOUT LIMITING BUYERS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER _ARTICLE V_ AND
_SECTION_ __ _ 15.3(A)_, (C) WITH RESPECT TO FRAUD (AS DEFINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT), AND (D) FOR ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE FOR
THE BREACH OR FAILURE OF A PARTY TO PERFORM ANY COVENANTS REQUIRED TO BE

AFTER THE CLOSING, THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF _ARTICLE XV_ ARE THE SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE RECOURSE OF SELLER AND BUYER, FOR THE BREACH OF ANY

 



36

    

 REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR NONFULFILLMENT OF ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT ON
THE PART OF SELLER OR BUYER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR CONFIRMED IN ANY
CERTIFICATE DELIVERED PURSUANT HERETO OR CONTAINED IN ANY TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT, AND SELLER DOES HEREBY RELEASE, ACQUIT AND FOREVER DISCHARGE ALL
BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES AND BUYER DOES HEREBY RELEASE, ACQUIT AND FOREVER
DISCHARGE ALL SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM ANY SUCH OTHER REMEDIES.

Section 15.6 _Procedure_. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Claim Notice_. Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement (" _Indemnified
Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a
third Person (a " _Third_ _-_ _Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that
is subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 15.3_ shall promptly
submit a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") to the other Party ("
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third-Party Claim, which, to be effective,
must state: (i) the Indemnified Partys good faith, reasonable estimate of the
amount claimed by such Indemnified Party to be owing, (ii) the basis for such
claim, described in reasonable detail with supporting documentation and a
copy of all papers served with respect to such Third-Party Claim, if
applicable, and (iii) a list identifying to the extent reasonably possible
each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed to such
Indemnified Party. The failure of an Indemnified Party to timely provide a
Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys
indemnification under this Agreement except to the extent that the defense of
such Third-Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified
Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and
other information with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party is authorized, prior to the election by the Indemnifying Party to assume
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, to file any motion, answer, or other
pleading that it shall deem necessary and appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party, all costs of which shall be included as Losses in
respect of such claim for indemnification.

 

(1) At the election of the Indemnifying Party, which shall be made within 45
days after receipt of the Claim Notice related thereto, if such election is
timely made, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim (such election to be
without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether
such claim is an indemnifiable claim under this _Article XV_ ), to defend such
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate
means, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 15.6(a)(1)_. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for
investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information
and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem
necessary to the proper defense of such Third-Party Claim, including the
making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-
Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate
in, but not control, the defense of the Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to defend the Third-Party Claim under this _Section_ __ _
15.6(a)(1)_, then the Indemnifying Party shall work diligently to defend the
Third-Party Claim.

 



37

    

(2) If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense
of the Third-Party Claim within the 45-day period provided in _Section_ __ _
15.6(a)(1)_, the Indemnified Party will use its Reasonable Efforts to defend,
at the Indemnifying Partys expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is
actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), in regards to the Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third-Party
Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought
hereunder without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in,
but not control, the defense of the Third-Party Claim.

(3) The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any judgment, compromise,
settlement, or discharge with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), unless such judgment,
compromise, settlement, or discharge (w) provides for the payment by the
Indemnifying Party of money as the sole relief for the claimant, (x) involves
no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any
Indemnified Party, (y) does not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified
Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified Partys business, and (z) includes, as a condition of any entry of
judgment, settlement, compromise, discharge, or other resolution, a complete
and unconditional general release by the third Person asserting the claim of
each affected Indemnified Party from any and all liabilities in respect of
such Third-Party Claim.

 

(4) In the case of a conflict between this _Section_ __ _ 15.6(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 10.9_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9_ will control.

(b) _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim
for indemnification under this Agreement against the Indemnifying Party other
than as a result of a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith
for a 30-day period beginning on the date the Indemnified Party provides the
Claim Notice to the Indemnified Party for such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to reach a resolution
as to such Direct Claim within the 30-day period, the Indemnified Party will
be entitled to seek appropriate remedies in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the limitations on recovery in this _Article XV_.
Promptly following the final determination of the amount of any Losses claimed
by the Indemnified Party in the Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay such Losses, if any, to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. If the Indemnified Party is required to institute
any proceedings in order to recover Losses, the cost of such proceedings
(including costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) will be added to the amount of Losses payable to the
Indemnified Party if and only to the extent the Indemnified Party recovers and
it is determined by the Arbitrators to be entitled to such treatment.

 



38

    

(c) _Non-Party Indemnified Parties_. Any claim for indemnity under this
Agreement (including this _Article XV_ ) by any Person other than Buyer or
Seller must be brought and administered by the applicable Party to this
Agreement. No Indemnified Party or Person other than Seller and Buyer shall
have any rights against Seller or Buyer under this Agreement (including this
_Article XV_ ) except as may be exercised on its behalf by Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, under this _Article XV_. Each of Seller and Buyer may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this _Article XV_ on
behalf of the other Indemnified Party affiliated with such Party in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Party for
any action or inaction under this _Article XV_. Without limiting the rights
of Seller under and to the extent provided under _Section_ __ _ 12.3_, except
to the extent a named Party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Agreement),
(i) no past, present, or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, advisor, or Representative or
Affiliate of any named Party to this Agreement, and (ii) no past, present, or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney, advisor, or Representative or Affiliate of any
of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements, or other obligations or liabilities of Seller or Buyer
under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any
claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
Transaction.

Section 15.7 _Express Negligence_. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD
HARMLESS, RELEASE, ASSUMED LIABILITIES, RETAINED LIABILITIES, WAIVER, AND
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, AND
DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT, OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER
FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THIS STATEMENT
COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

Section 15.8 _No Insurance_. The indemnifications provided in this Agreement
shall not be construed as a form of insurance.

Section 15.9 _Reservation as to Third-Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have
against any third Person for any obligations or liabilities that may be
suffered by or incurred with respect to the Assets, the Retained Liabilities,
or the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 15.10 _Reduction in Losses_. Each Indemnified Party shall use
Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Losses to the extent required by Law or by
using Reasonable Efforts to maintain customary insurance coverage with respect
to the Assets, the Retained Liabilities or the Assumed Liabilities
and validly making and diligently pursuing claims relating to the Assets, the
Retained Liabilities, or the Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement,
including any insurance claims. The amount of any Losses for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity under this _Article XV_ shall be
reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually realized by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to such Losses.

 

Section 15.11 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for U.S. federal and applicable state
income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 15.12 _Survival_.

 

(a) _Seller_ __ _s Representations and Warranties_. All Non-Fundamental
Representations of Seller shall survive the Closing until the date that is 12
months after the Closing Date. The Fundamental Representations shall survive
the Closing without time limit, except for those contained in _Section_ __ _
6.12_, which shall survive the Closing until the date that is 60 days after
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation.

 



39

    

(b) _Seller_ __ _s Indemnity for Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities._
Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(4)_ shall survive
the Closing until the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date. As a
condition precedent to Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section_ __ _
15.3(a)(4)_ if Seller does not receive from Buyer (either on behalf of itself
or on behalf of any other Buyer Indemnified Party under  _Section_ __ _
15.6(c)_) a Claim Notice before the date that is 12 months after the Closing
Date, Seller has no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
any such Losses arising under  _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(4)_ and Buyer (on
behalf of itself and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) hereby waives
all rights to receive indemnification from Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.3(a)(4)_ for any Losses claimed, alleged, incurred, or otherwise in such
Claim Notice not timely delivered in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
15.12(b)_.

 

(c) _Seller s Covenants_. Each of (i) the covenants and performance
obligations of Seller set forth in this Agreement to be performed prior to or
at Closing shall survive until the date that is six months after the Closing
Date, and (ii) the covenants and performance obligations of Seller set forth
in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to be performed after Closing
shall survive until fully performed.

(d) _Seller_ __ _s Retained Liabilities_. All Retained Liabilities of Seller
shall survive until the date that is 60 days after the expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitation.

 

(e) _Buyer_ __ _s Representations and Covenants_. The representations,
warranties, covenants and performance obligations of Buyer in this Agreement
and the other documents executed at Closing, and all covenants, assumptions,
and indemnities set forth in this _Article XV_ shall survive the Closing
indefinitely.

 

(f) _Survival After Claim_. Notwithstanding _Sections_ _15.12(a)_ through
_15.12(d)_ , if a Claim Notice has been properly delivered under _Section_ __
_ 15.6_ on or before the date any representation, warranty, covenant,
indemnity or performance obligation would otherwise expire under such Sections
alleging a right to indemnification or defense for Losses arising out,
relating to, or attributable to the breach of such representation, warranty,
covenant, indemnity or performance obligation, such representation, warranty,
covenant, indemnity or performance obligation shall continue to survive until
the claims asserted in such Claim Notice that are based on the breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant, indemnity or performance obligation have
been fully and finally resolved or by agreement of the Parties and

shall provide prompt notice of any such proposed release, announcement,
statement, or comment to the other Party and shall provide the other Party

constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the

not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in any
other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law,
that a final and unappealable judgment against a Party in any action or
proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the

fact and amount of such judgment. Except to the extent that a different
determination or finding is mandated due to the Law being that of a different
jurisdiction, the Parties agree that all judicial determinations or findings
by a state or federal court in Houston, Texas, with respect to any matter

otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

(b) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transaction is not affected in any adverse manner to Seller
or Buyer. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transaction is fulfilled to the greatest extent possible; _provided, however,_
that if the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 15.12_ are determined to

participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or

Agreement to Articles, Sections, or Exhibits, such reference will be to an
Article, Section, or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, (1) "or" is disjunctive
but not necessarily exclusive, (2) words in the singular include the
plural and vice versa, (3) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereunder," and words of similar nature refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited, and (4)
the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in reference to a Party includes the
masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require. The Disclosure
Schedule and Exhibits attached to this Agreement are deemed to be part of
this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. If the date
of performance falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the actual date
of performance will be the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.
