attributable to each Environmental Defect. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, &#147;factual substantiation for each Environmental Defect&#148; means reports prepared by the Environmental Consultant. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the Defect Notice Date. Buyer irrevocably waives all Environmental Defects not submitted on or before the Defect Notice Date.
