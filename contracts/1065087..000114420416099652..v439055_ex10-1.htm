14

and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, employees, agents,

resulting from (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty when made or deemed made by the Subscriber in or pursuant to
this Agreement or (ii) any breach or default in performance by the Subscriber

(d) _Limitations on Indemnity_. The Subscriber and the Company
agree, for themselves and on behalf of the Subscriber Indemnitees and the
Company Indemnitees:

  



  

(i) _Limitations on Subscriber Indemnities_. Except for claims for
indemnification for Losses in respect of Fundamental Representations, no
Subscriber Indemnitee will assert any claims for indemnification under
_Section 6(b)_ in respect of any Loss incurred or suffered by such Subscriber
Indemnitee until such time as the aggregate of all Losses (including Losses in
respect of Fundamental Representations) that the Subscriber Indemnitees may
have under _Section 6(b)_ exceeds €500,000 (the "Indemnity Threshold"), and
then only for the aggregate amount of all Losses in excess of the Indemnity
Threshold. The aggregate liability of the Company in respect of claims for
indemnification pursuant to (x) _Section 6(b)(i)_ and (iii) shall never exceed
€31,000,000 and (I) until the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date,
shall be limited to the Period 1 Cap and (II) after the date that is 24
months after the Closing Date and until the date that is 48 months after the
Closing Date, shall be limited to the Revised Cap and (y) _Section 6(b)(ii)_
shall be limited to €109,000,000.

  



  

(ii) _Limitations on Company Indemnities_ _._ Except for claims for
indemnification for Losses in respect of Fundamental Representations, no
Company Indemnitee will assert any claims for indemnification under _Section
6(c)_ in respect of any Loss incurred or suffered by such Company Indemnitee
until such time as the aggregate of all Losses (including Losses in respect of
Fundamental Representations) that Company Indemnitees may have under _Section
6(c)_ together with all "Losses" that the "Indemnified Party" may have under
Article 9.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement (as such terms are defined
therein) exceeds the Indemnity Threshold, and then only for the aggregate
amount of all Losses in excess of the Indemnity Threshold. Except for claims
for indemnification for Losses relating to the title to shares (including
title to INC Shares) representation and warranty of the Subscriber under the
Share Purchase Agreement (the "SPA Title Representation"), the aggregate
liability of the Subscriber in respect of claims for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 6(c)_ together with all "Losses" that the "Indemnified Party" may
have under Article 9.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement (as such terms are
defined therein) shall never exceed €31,000,000, and (I) until the date that
is 24 months after the Closing Date, shall be limited to the Period 1 Cap and
(II) after the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date and until the
date that is 48 months after the Closing Date, shall be limited to the
Revised Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate liability of the
Subscriber in respect of the SPA Title Representation shall be the Price.

  



    

15

 



    



  

(iii) _Revised Cap_. For all and any Claim of Indemnity notified by
the Indemnified Parties to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement after the date that is 24 months following the Closing Date (the
"Adjustment Date"), the Cap shall be reduced to a "Revised Cap" equal to the
greater of (x) €15,000,000.00 and (y) the sum of €15,000,000.00 and the Carry
Over Amount, provided that the Revised Cap shall under no circumstance exceed
€31,000,000. For purposes hereof, "Carry Over Amount" means the aggregate
value of Claims for Indemnity made prior to or on the date that is 24 months
following the Closing Date which (a) the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged
in writing to be due and payable to the Indemnified Party, but have not been
paid prior to the Adjustment Date or (b) have been notified to the
Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party in a notice complying with
_Section 6(d)(iv)_ below.

  



  

(iv) _Claims_. In the event that the Indemnified Party becomes aware
of any Loss claim, proceeding or other matter in respect of which the
Indemnifying Party is obliged to indemnify the Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written
notice to the Indemnifying Party and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent of such
claim, which notice shall state the nature of the claim, basis for
indemnification of such claim, the amount thereof (to the extent known or
estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
claim), the method of computation thereof (to the extent known or estimated),
any other material details pertaining to such claim and, in the case of a
Third Party Claim (as defined below), the basis therefor and any remedy
sought thereunder (collectively, the "Claim of Indemnity"), provided that any
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent of any damages actually
suffered by the Indemnifying Party as a result of such delay.

  



  

(v) The Claim of Indemnity shall specify whether it arises as a
result of a claim by a Person against an Indemnified Party (the "Third Party
Claim") or whether the Claim of Indemnity does not so arise (the "Direct
Claim").

  



  

(A) With respect to any Direct Claim,

  



  

(1) Following receipt of the Claim of Indemnity from the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) Business Days to
make such investigation in connection with the Claim of Indemnity as it
considers is reasonably required. For the purpose of such investigation, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate its request
of indemnification in respect of the Claim of Indemnity, together with all
such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

  



  

(2) If both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30)-Business Day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such Claim of Indemnity,
then the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party the full
agreed upon amount of the Claim of Indemnity, failing which the matter shall
be referred to the legal proceedings as provided for under _Section 8.(d)_
(if in such instance a Company Indemnitee is the Indemnified Party, such
amount shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account or by means of offset
against the Promissory Note B).

  



    

16

 



    



  

(3) It is however further agreed that in any event in which within
thirty (30) Business Days from the issuance of a Claim of Indemnity the
Indemnified Party does not receive Indemnifying Party's written notice
formally contesting it, such Claim of Indemnity shall be deemed as finally
agreed and accepted by the Indemnifying Party and such amount shall promptly
be paid to the Indemnified Party (if in such instance the Indemnified Party
is a Company Indemnitee, such amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent out
of the Escrow Account without the need for instruction from the Indemnifying
Party or by means of offset against Promissory Note B regardless of the then-
current holder of the Promissory Note B) .

  



  

(B) With respect to any Third Party Claim,

  



  

(1) The Indemnified Party shall properly and diligently defend (when
applicable) any such Claim; the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate, and, where possible, join, at the Indemnifying Party's own cost
by counsel or counsels of its election, in the defense of any such claim.

  



  

(2) The Indemnified Party shall not make or accept any settlement of
any Third Party Claim, nor shall make acquiescence thereto nor shall (to the
extent of its ability) without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be withheld without reasonable justification.

  



  

(3) If the nature of any Third Party Claim is such that any
Indemnified Party is required by any judgment, order, injunction, award,
decree, law or regulation to make a payment to any third party (including
public offices and authorities) with respect to the Third Party Claim before
the completion of settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the
Indemnified Party may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall,
forthwith upon demand by the Indemnifying Party, reimburse the Indemnified
Party for such payment (which, in instances where the Indemnified Party is a
Company Indemnitee, such payment may be made from the Indemnity Escrow
Account or by means of offset against the Promissory Note B). If the amount
of any liability of the Indemnified Parties under the Third Party Claim in
respect of which such payment was made, as finally determined, proves to be
less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party (including amounts paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account or
by means of offset against the Promissory Note B), the Indemnified Party
shall, forthwith upon receipt of the difference from the third party, pay the
amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party.

  



    

17

 



    



  

(vi) _Sole Remedy_. Each party agrees that, from and after the
Closing, the sole liability and obligations of each party and the sole
right, remedy and entitlement of each party for recovery of any monetary
claim with respect to this Agreement (and this Agreement only) shall be
limited to indemnification under this _Section 6_ , and each party hereby
waives any and all other statutory and common law rights and remedies
(including other rights of indemnification and contribution) which it now has
or may hereafter have, provided that such waiver shall in no event be
construed to prevent such party from seeking specific performance or other
equitable relief or remedies or from bringing an action for actual fraud.

  



  

(vii) _Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything else herein, the Company
Indemnitees shall, subject to the limitations contained in this _Section 6_
, be entitled to indemnification under this _Section 6_ only to the extent of
amounts available in the Indemnity Escrow Account or the remaining
outstanding principal of Promissory Note B; it being understood that the
Indemnity Escrow Account and Promissory Note B shall be the sole and
exclusive source of recovery and remedy of any of the Company Indemnitees with
respect to any claim for indemnification under this _Section 6_ and, as such,
the indemnification obligations, set forth in this _Section 6_  are non-
recourse in all respects to the Subscriber or any current, former or
prospective stockholder, investor or limited partner, other Affiliate or the
respective representatives of the Company. The amounts held in the Indemnity
Escrow Account and set off against Promissory Note B shall be applied in the
order claims related to the applicable Losses are resolved (i.e., Losses
related to claims resolved at an earlier date will be satisfied before Losses
related to claims resolved at a later date).

  



  

7. _Termination_. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, this Agreement shall terminate immediately without further action from either party if the Share Purchase Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 2.6 or Article 2.7 of the Share Purchase Agreement.

  



  

8. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and no term or provision of this Agreement is for the
benefit of, or intended to create any obligations to, any other Person (except
for the Indemnified Parties under _Section 6_ ). The Subscriber shall not be
permitted to distribute or otherwise transfer its Consideration Shares to any
Person except in the manner set forth in the Rights Agreements (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, in registered sales and/or private
placements following the Lock-Up Period as provided in the Registration
Rights Agreement). Prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned
and no rights or obligations hereunder may be transferred by the Subscriber.
After the Closing, this Agreement shall not be assigned and no rights or
obligations hereunder may be transferred by the Subscriber except that the
Subscriber will be permitted to assign its rights and obligations to any
Permitted Transferee as provided in (and as such term is defined in)
the Rights Agreements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with private placements as provided in Section 3.01(c) and 4.01 of the
Registration Rights Agreement). This Agreement shall be binding upon a party
hereto only upon the manual execution and delivery (which delivery may be by
telecopy or facsimile or electronic mail) of a signature page to a counterpart
hereto.

  



    

18

 



    



  

(b) _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended only by an
agreement in writing executed by all parties hereto. A party may waive
in whole or in part any benefit or right provided to it under this Agreement,
such waiver being effective only if contained in a writing executed by the
waiving party. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance
of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to
exercise any right or remedy consequent upon breach thereof shall constitute a
waiver of any such breach or of any other covenant, duty, agreement or
condition, nor shall any delay or omission of either party to exercise any
right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right accruing
to it thereafter.

  



  

(c) _Headings_. The heading references herein are for convenience
purposes only, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

  



  

(d) _Governing Law; ICC Arbitration_.

  



  

(i) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be
governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws rules
thereof.

  



  

(ii) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to,
or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including with respect to the formation,
applicability, performance, breach, termination, validity or
enforceability thereof, shall be fully and finally settled by arbitration.
The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators, in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce ("Rules") in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they
may be modified herein or by mutual agreement of the parties. The seat of the
arbitration shall be New York, New York, USA and it shall be conducted in
English, provided that either party may submit testimony or documentary
evidence in any language if it furnishes, upon the request of the other
party, a translation into English of any such testimony or
documentary evidence. The arbitrators shall determine questions of
arbitrability and jurisdiction and shall be empowered to grant interim relief.

  



  

(iii) The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties.
The parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and waive their
right to any form of recourse based on grounds other than those contained in
the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards of 1958 (the "New York Convention," which shall govern the
arbitration and enforcement of any arbitral award) insofar as such waiver can
validly be made. The parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
federal courts located in New York County, New York for purposes of enforcing
this section, and any arbitral award, in accordance with the New York
Convention. The parties agree to personal jurisdiction in said courts for such
purposes and irrevocably waive any defense on the basis of _forum non
conveniens_ , lack of jurisdiction or improper venue in regard to any such
proceedings brought in the federal courts located in New York County, New
York.

  



    

19

 



    



  

(iv) The claimant shall nominate an arbitrator in its request for
arbitration. The respondent shall nominate an arbitrator within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of the request for arbitration. The two arbitrators shall
nominate a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the nomination of
the second arbitrator. The third arbitrator shall act as chair of the
tribunal. If any of the three arbitrators is not nominated within the time
prescribed above, then the International Court of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce shall appoint that arbitrator.

  



  

(v) In order to facilitate the comprehensive and efficient
resolution of related disputes, and upon request of any party to the
arbitration proceeding, the arbitration tribunal may consolidate the
arbitration proceeding with any other arbitration proceeding relating to this
Agreement or to the Share Purchase Agreement, Registration Rights Agreement or
Stockholders Agreement. The arbitration tribunal shall not consolidate such
arbitrations unless it determines that (i) there are issues of fact or law
common to the two (2) proceedings so that a consolidated proceeding would be
more efficient than separate proceedings, and (ii) no party would be unduly
prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through undue delay or otherwise.

  



  

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a
Party may make a request to a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to
the Rules for interim or emergency measures necessary to preserve the party's
rights, including pre-arbitration attachments or injunctions. A request for
such interim relief to a court shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a
waiver of, this agreement to arbitrate. Each of the parties hereto recognizes
and agrees that money damages may be insufficient and, therefore, in the
event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement the
aggrieved party, in addition to any other remedy which may be available to
such party at law or in equity, will be entitled to seek specific performance
and injunctive relief, without posting bond or other security, and without
the necessity of proving actual or threatened damages, which remedy such
damaged party will be entitled to seek in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

  



  

(vii) All disputes under this Agreement shall be kept confidential. In
any arbitration proceeding, the arbitrators shall take all measures necessary
for the protection of Confidential Information. All proceedings and any award
and any information obtained from another party in connection with the
arbitration shall be deemed Confidential Information subject to Article 13 of
the Share Purchase Agreement;  _provided_ that the parties further agree that
such Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent necessary to
enforce any award or enforce this Agreement to arbitrate, provided, further,
