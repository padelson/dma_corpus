(collectively, the " _Adjustment Statements_ "). Notwithstanding anything

Working Capital Statement, as modified by the Agreed Principles and in a
format substantially similar to, and using accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies consistent with those used in the preparation of,
the Sample Working Capital Statement, except that Buyer is permitted to
conduct a physical inventory on or near the Closing Date, at Buyers cost and
expense, for purposes of preparing the Statement. The parties acknowledge and
agree that if the Closing Date had been May 31, 2012, the Closing
Working Capital would have been as set forth on the Sample Working Capital
Statement, and that the preparation of the Statement and the determination of
the actual Closing Working Capital pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ are not

following receipt by the Shareholders Representative of the Adjustment
Statements, the Shareholders Representative shall deliver written notice to
Buyer of any dispute the Shareholders have that any Adjustment Statement has
not been prepared on a basis consistent with the requirements of this _Section

the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) may not
dispute the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used
in preparing the Statement to the extent they are consistent with GAAP as
used in the preparation of the Sample Working Capital Statement, as modified
by the Agreed Principles. If the Shareholders Representative does not so
notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Adjustment Statements within
such thirty (30)day period, such Adjustment Statements will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event of such notification of a
dispute, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative, notwithstanding such good faith
efforts, fail to resolve all or any portion of such dispute within thirty (30)
days after the Shareholders Representative advises Buyer of the dispute, then
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative jointly shall engage the firm of
McGladrey LLP (or if McGladrey LLP cannot or is unwilling to serve in such
capacity, a nationally recognized, independent public accounting firm selected
by mutual agreement of the Shareholders Representative and Buyer, or if they
cannot agree, selected by mutual agreement of the independent public
accounting firms regularly used by the Company (prior to the Closing Date) and
by Buyer in the conduct of their respective businesses) (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "), acting as experts and not as arbitrators, to resolve the dispute, or
any remaining portion thereof, on a basis consistent with the requirements of
this _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.7_, as applicable. The parties agree that
they will request that the Accounting Firm render its reasoned written
decision within thirty (30) days after referral of the dispute to the
Accounting Firm for decision pursuant

 



\- 15 -   hereto. In resolving the dispute, the Accounting Firm shall limit its review
to the disputed items identified by the Shareholders Representative in the
written notification (which decision, in the case of each disputed item,
shall be within the range of the respective amounts asserted by the
Shareholders Representative and Buyer to be the correct amount of such
disputed item). All determinations so made by the Accounting Firm shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, absent manifest error.
Judgment may be entered to enforce such determination in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The Shareholders and Buyer shall bear their respective
expenses and fees and expenses of their representatives and experts in
connection with the preparation, review, dispute (if any) and final
determination of the Adjustment Statements and Closing Working Capital;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders, on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand, shall share the fees and other expenses of the Accounting
Firm equally.

 

(b) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section 2.3_,
each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other party and
their respective representatives all information, records, data and working
papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

(c) Upon the final determination pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Closing
Working Capital (the " _Actual Closing Working Capital_ "), the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted, subject to _Section 2.3(f)_, as follows:

 

(i) If the Actual Closing Working Capital is equal to the Target Working
Capital, then there shall be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price
based on the Closing Working Capital.

(ii) If the Actual Closing Working Capital is greater than the Target Working
Capital, then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to
such excess to the Shareholders Representative (for the benefit of and on
behalf of all Shareholders); provided, however, that the maximum amount
payable by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be $2,000,000.
_In no event will Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
have any responsibility or liability for the allocation of any such payment
among the Shareholders by the Shareholders Representative or the distribution
of any such payment by the Shareholders Representative to the Shareholders.

 

(iii) If the Actual Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital, then such shortfall amount shall be paid to Buyer from the Working
Capital Escrow Account.

(d) Upon the final determination pursuant to  _Section 2.3(a)_ of the
aggregate amount of any and all Company Cash as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the " _Actual Company Cash Amount_ "), the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as follows:

 



\- 16 -  (i) If the Actual Company Cash Amount is equal to the Certified Company
Cash Amount, then there shall be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price
based on Company Cash.

(ii) If the Actual Company Cash Amount is greater than the Certified Company
Cash Amount, then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal
to such excess to the Shareholders Representative (for the benefit of and on
behalf of all Shareholders) _._ In no event will Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates have any responsibility or liability for the
allocation of any such payment among the Shareholders by the Shareholders
Representative or the distribution of any such payment by the Shareholders
Representative to the Shareholders.

(iii) If the Actual Company Cash Amount is less than the Certified Company
Cash Amount, then such shortfall amount shall be paid to Buyer from the
Working Capital Escrow Account.

(e) Upon the final determination pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Real
Estate Adjustment, the Building #1 Purchase Price and Building #2 Purchase
Price, as applicable, shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) If the Real Estate Adjustment as so determined shows a net amount being
owed to Building #1 Owner and/or Building #2 Owner, then Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such amount to the Shareholders
Representative (for the benefit of Building #1 Owner and/or Building #2 Owner,
as applicable).

 

(ii) If the Real Estate Adjustment as so determined shows a net amount being
owed to Buyer, then such amount shall be paid to Buyer from the Working
Capital Escrow Account.

(f) Upon final determination of all amounts owed pursuant to _Sections
2.3(c)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ ), the aggregate amounts owed to the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders, Building #1 Owner and/or
Building #2 Owner) shall be netted against the aggregate amounts owed to
Buyer. If such aggregate net amount is positive in favor of the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders, Building #1 Owner and/or
Building #2 Owner), then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid such aggregate
net amount in cash to the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the
Shareholders, Building #1 Owner and/or Building #2 Owner) by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Shareholders Representative to Buyer. Any such payment is
to be made prior to the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days following the
date on which all such amounts are finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_ and (B) December 31, 2012. In no event will Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates have any responsibility or liability for the
allocation of any such payment among the Shareholders, Building #1 Owner or
Building #2 Owner by the Shareholders Representative or the distribution of
any such payment by the Shareholders Representative to the Shareholders,
Building #1 Owner or Building #2 Owner. If such aggregate net amount is
positive in favor of Buyer, 

 



\- 17 -   then the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders,
Building #1 Owner and/or Building #2 Owner) and Buyer shall deliver a joint
written authorization to the Escrow Agent, within two (2) Business Days from
the date on which all such amounts are finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_, authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such net amount to Buyer from
the Working Capital Escrow Account. In the event that such aggregate net
amount is positive in favor of Buyer and exceeds the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, Buyer shall be entitled at its sole discretion (i) to be paid an
amount equal to such excess amount from the General Escrow Account, or (ii)
to be paid an amount, in cash, equal to such excess amount from the
Shareholders.

2.4 _Clawback Payment_. If during the two-year period beginning as of the
Closing Date (a) a Sale Event occurs or (b) Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) enters into a binding agreement to effect a Sale

the sum of $270,000,000, the Building #1 Purchase Price, the Building #2
Purchase Price and the Building #4 Purchase Price (the " _Clawback Payment_
"). The Clawback Payment shall be payable upon the consummation of the Sale
Event; provided, however, that if any portion of the Clawback Payment is
attributable to consideration payable after the closing of the Sale Event then
that portion of the Clawback Payment shall be payable when such consideration
is paid to Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable. As used in this  _Section
2.4_ and the definitions of Sale Event and Sale Proceeds, "Company" shall be
deemed to include any Affiliate of Buyer that is the successor to the Company
pursuant one or more inter-company transactions, including mergers,
conversions, consolidations and sales or transfers of capital stock or assets.

expected to lead to, any other bid. The Shareholders Representative shall
promptly advise Buyer orally and in writing of any other bid or any inquiry
with respect to or which could lead to any other bid and the identity of the
Person making any such other bid or inquiry and the material terms thereof. As

to the extent necessary to render the provision enforceable, and such
provision as so modified shall be enforced.

available to the public prior to the Closing; (ii) information that is or
becomes generally available to the public through no action by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, any Shareholder, any Beneficiary, or any of their
respective employees or representatives; or (iii) information that is later
lawfully acquired by any Shareholder, any Beneficiary or any of their
respective representatives from sources other than those related to their
prior ownership of the Company (provided that such source is not under an
obligation to keep such information confidential); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Shareholders and the Beneficiaries may disclose Business
Confidential Information to their respective representatives in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements so long as such representatives are informed by the Shareholders
or the Beneficiaries of the nature of the Business Confidential Information
and are directed by the Shareholders or the Beneficiaries to hold the Business
Confidential Information in confidence, and the Shareholders or Beneficiaries,
as applicable, shall be responsible for any breach of the confidentiality
provisions of this _Section 6.8(b)_ by such representatives; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prevent the Company, the
Shareholders, the Beneficiaries or any of their respective representatives
from using Business Confidential Information in any manner otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. If, after the
Closing, any Shareholder or any Beneficiary or any of their respective
representatives is legally required to disclose any Business Confidential
Information, such Shareholder or Beneficiary, as applicable, shall (A)
promptly notify Buyer to permit Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to
seek a protective order or take other appropriate action and (B) cooperate as
reasonably requested by Buyer in Buyers efforts to obtain a protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such Business Confidential Information, but only at Buyers sole cost and
expense. If, after the Closing, and in the absence of a protective order, any
Shareholder or Beneficiary or any of such Shareholders or
Beneficiarys representatives is compelled as a matter of Law to disclose
Business Confidential Information to a third party, such Shareholder or
Beneficiary may disclose (and such Shareholder or Beneficiary shall cause any
such representative(s) to disclose) to the third party compelling disclosure
only the part of such Business Confidential Information as is required by Law
to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to any such disclosure,
any such Shareholder or Beneficiary will, and will cause any such
representative(s) to, as applicable, use good faith efforts to advise and
consult with Buyer and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and
wording of such disclosure.

 

6.9 _Taxes_.

 



\- 52 -  (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax with respect to
the income, property or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
is attributable to any Straddle Period will be apportioned between the period
of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the
Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the
Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end of
the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance
with this  _Section 6.9(a)_. The portion of such Tax attributable to the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than sales
or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any
Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a
Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes,
value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on
or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period,
be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period
ended on and included the Closing Date. The portion of Tax attributable to a
Post-Closing Straddle Period shall be calculated in a corresponding manner.
To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a
Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some
other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand, the portion
of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing
Straddle Period will be determined based on the foregoing and based on the
manner in which the actual Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is
determined. In the case of a Tax that is (x) paid for the privilege of doing
business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and (y) computed based on
business activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior to the
privilege period, any reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period" or a
"taxable period" shall mean such accounting period and not the privilege
period. Proration of property taxes will be made on the basis of the most
recent officially certified tax valuation and tax assessment rate for the
corresponding assets. If the valuation or rate pertain to a tax period other
than that in which the Closing occurs, such proration will be recalculated at
such time as actual tax bills for such period are available, and the parties
will cooperate with each other in all respects in connection with such
recalculation and pay any sums due in consequence thereof to the party
entitled to recover the same within sixty (60) days after notice of the
issuance of such actual tax bills.

(b) Buyer will timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely prepared and
filed) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period (other than any Tax Returns for
which the Shareholders have filing responsibility under  _Section 6.9(c)_)
(the " _Buyer Returns_ "). Buyer will make available to the Shareholders
Representative any Buyer Tax Returns with respect to any Straddle Period for
review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the respective due
dates of such Buyer Returns, and the Shareholders Representative will provide
Buyer with the Shareholders comments no later than ten (10) days before the
respective due dates of such Buyer Returns; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
the event such Buyer Returns are due within thirty (30) days of the Closing

 



\- 53 -   Date, Buyer will provide such Buyer Returns to the Shareholders
Representative at least ten (10) days prior to the respective due date, and
the Shareholders Representative will provide Buyer with the Shareholders
comments no later than seven (7) days before the respective due date of such
Buyer Returns. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the actual date
of filing of any Buyer Return that is required to be filed with respect to a
Straddle Period, the Shareholders will pay (or cause to be paid) to Buyer cash
in an amount equal to the Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
(as determined pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_) shown on such Buyer Return.

(c) The Shareholders will timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely
prepared and filed) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (the " _Seller Returns_ "), and will pay (or cause to be paid) all
Taxes with respect to the Seller Returns (whether imposed on the Company or
its Subsidiaries or the (direct or indirect) equityholders of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its Affiliates). The Shareholders Representative will make
available to Buyer any Seller Returns to be filed after the Closing Date for
review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the respective due dates
of such Seller Returns, and Buyer will provide the Shareholders Representative
with Buyers comments no later than ten (10) days before the respective due
dates of such Seller Returns.

(d) Except as provided in the last sentence of this  _Section 6.9(d)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) imposed on Buyer or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne and paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer, at
its own expense, will cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. Each party shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any available exemptions from such Transfer
Taxes and to cooperate with the other party in providing any information or
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. Building #1
Owner and Building #2 Owner shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the transfer of Building #1 Property and Building
#2 Property to the Company.

 

(e) Except to the extent attributable to the carryback of any attribute
generated after the Closing Date, any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer
or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against
Tax that Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries utilizes that relate
to Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall
be for the account of the Shareholders, and Buyer shall pay over to the
Shareholders Representative any such refund or the amount of any such credit
(net of any Taxes of Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
attributable to such refund or credit and net of any costs of Buyer or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to obtaining such refund or
credit) within 15 days after receipt or utilization thereof.

 

(f) Except as required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) amend any Tax Returns
filed

 



\- 54 -   with respect to any tax year ending on or before the Closing Date or with
respect to any Straddle Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has
retroactive effect to any such year or to any Straddle Period, in each such
case without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative
(which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(g) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations, and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities
imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Shareholders, on the other hand, shall
cooperate fully with each other, including, without limitation, the
furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records,
personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or
other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns,
the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes.

(h) This  _Section 6.9(h)_ and not _Section 9.2_ shall control any inquiry,
assessment, proceeding or other similar event relating to Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Shareholders Representative shall have the right
to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries before the
relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any inquiry, assessment, proceeding
or other similar event with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (a "
_Tax Matter_ ") relating solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall have
the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such
Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, preparing Tax Returns and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Tax Matter; provided, however, (i) Buyer has the right (but not the
duty) to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by Shareholders, and (ii)
the Shareholders Representative shall not enter into any settlement of or
otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed. Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of the Company
and its Subsidiaries before the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any
Tax Matter that does not relate solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and has
the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such
Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) the
Shareholders Representative shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from counsel employed by Buyer, and (ii) Buyer shall not
enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter that
affects the liability of the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 9.1 _without
the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 



\- 55 -  (i) The Shareholders shall join with Buyer in making an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election under
state, local, and foreign Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Shares hereunder (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ ").
In furtherance of the preceding sentence, the Shareholders shall execute and
deliver to Buyer such documents or forms as Buyer shall reasonably request or
as are required by applicable Law to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.
The Shareholders shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other
Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections on their Tax Returns
to the extent required by applicable Law, and shall take no position
inconsistent with treating the purchase by Buyer of the Shares as a
transaction to which Section 338(h)(10) applies. The consideration paid for
the Shares hereunder and the liabilities (to the extent included in amount
realized for federal income Tax purposes) shall be allocated among the assets
of the Company in accordance with their fair market values determined using
the methodology set forth on _Schedule 6.9(i)_ (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ")
and Section 338 of the Code. Buyer, the Shareholders and each of their
Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
Allocation Schedule, and none of the parties will voluntarily take any
position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule in any
inquiry, assessment, audit, action, proceeding or other similar event
relating to Taxes.

(j) All Tax sharing or allocation agreements, arrangements or similar
Contracts with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries will
be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
and its Subsidiaries will not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

6.10 _Release by the Shareholders_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each of the Shareholders and the
Beneficiaries, on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates,

of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and pursuant to any
Contract between any Seller Related Person and a Company Released Party (as to

Person Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller Related Person Claims

Beneficiaries, for itself and the other Seller Related Persons, hereby
expressly waives, surrenders and agrees to forego any and all protections,
rights or benefits to which the Shareholders and the Beneficiaries otherwise

agreement, each of the Shareholders and the Beneficiaries expressly accepts
and assumes the risk of facts being other than or different from the

the right to (a) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ or
(b) proceed with the Closing, provided that upon the Closing, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived all claims, including all indemnity claims pursuant to
_ARTICLE IX_ , for all matters set forth in the Updated Disclosure Schedules.

provide each employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries who remains employed
by the Company or a Subsidiary following the Closing (each, a " _Continuing

benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to

guidelines set forth on _Schedule 8.1_ (the " _Severance Guidelines_ "), Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide severance payments and/or
benefits to such terminated Continuing Employee in accordance with the

held with the Company or its Subsidiaries by the Continuing Employee prior to
Closing.

of each Continuing Employee as of the Closing with either the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as service with Buyer or its Affiliates for
purposes of eligibility to participate, other than (A) with respect to any

recognition would result in a duplication of benefits; (ii) cause the waiver
of any pre-existing conditions, waiting period 

 



\- 61 -   limitations, or eligibility waiting periods with respect to such Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents, in each case to the extent waived

reasonable access to and copies of data regarding ages, dates of hire,
compensation, job description and, subject to applicable Law, such other
personnel and employee benefits records as Buyer may reasonably request in
respect of any employee of, or other service provider to, the Company. 

8.4 _No Employment Rights or Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall (a) create any third party beneficiary or other rights
in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, (b) constitute or create an employment agreement, (c) constitute or
be deemed to constitute an amendment to any Employee Plan or any employee
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates or (d) limit
the ability of Buyer or any of the Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Continuing Employee following the Closing.

ARTICLE IX INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

9.1 _General Indemnification Obligation_. Subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth in this _Article IX_, from and after the Closing:

(a) The Shareholders (solely through the General Escrow Account, as provided
in _Section 9.1(j)_) will, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries),
and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, agents,
advisers and representatives (each, a " _Buyer Indemnitee_ ") from and
against, and pay and 

 



\- 62 -   reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any Covered Losses resulting from,
arising out or otherwise in respect of: (i) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Shareholders herein or under any
Ancillary Agreement; (ii) any failure by any Shareholder to perform any
covenant or agreement hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement or fulfill
any other obligation in respect hereof or thereof; and (iii) any Selling
Expenses and Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries not paid on or
prior to the Closing.

(b) Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders, their
respective Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees, agents, advisers and representatives (each, a " _Seller Indemnitee_
") from and against, and pay and reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any
Covered Losses resulting from, arising out or otherwise in respect of (i) any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer herein or under any
Ancillary Agreement and (ii) any failure by Buyer to perform any covenant or
agreement hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement or fulfill any other
obligation in respect hereof or thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding any provisions of _Section 9.1(a)_ to the contrary, no
Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder unless the aggregate amount of all such Covered Losses of
all Buyer Indemnitees exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Covered
Losses in excess of the Basket. Notwithstanding the foregoing, indemnification
for Covered Losses in connection with an inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation shall not be subject to or applied to the Basket; provided,
however, that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ with respect to Covered Losses for an
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties contained in  _Section
4.12_ (Taxes) regarding Taxes other than Income Taxes unless the aggregate
amount of all such Covered Losses of all Buyer Indemnitees exceeds $750,000
(the " _Non-Income Taxes Basket_ "), in which case the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Covered Losses in excess of
the Non-Income Taxes Basket.

(d) For purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ , all Covered Losses shall be computed
net of (i) any insurance coverage with respect thereto (which coverage shall
be net of any self-insurance retention or other self-insurance set asides that
may otherwise be available), in each case that reduce such Covered Losses
that would otherwise be sustained; (ii) any amounts recovered or recoverable
by the Indemnified Party from any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or
another Indemnified Party) with respect to such Covered Losses (whether under
any agreement for indemnification, contribution or otherwise) and (iii) the
amount of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate
thereof) that is attributable to the Covered Losses to which such claim
relates in the taxable year in which the claim occurs. For purposes of this
_Section 9.1(d)_, the Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party (or any
Affiliate thereof) shall be determined by comparing the

 



\- 63 -   Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party without taking into account any Tax
attribute resulting from the Covered Loss with the Taxes paid by the
Indemnified Party, treating any such Tax attribute as the last such tax
attribute on any Tax Return.

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
all insurance claims, other third party payments to which it or they may be
entitled in connection with any Covered Losses incurred (with all of the costs
and expenses of exercising such commercially reasonable efforts being deemed
Covered Losses). If any Buyer Indemnitee (or any Affiliate) receives any
insurance or other third party payment in connection with any claim for
Covered Losses for which it has already received an indemnity payment from the
General Escrow Account, it shall pay into the General Escrow Account within
thirty (30) days after such insurance or other payment is received, an amount
equal to the excess of (x) the amount previously received with respect to such
claim plus the amount of such insurance or other third party payment, over
(y) the amount of Covered Losses to which the Buyer Indemnitees have become
entitled under this Agreement in connection with such claim.

 

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim or Liability that an Indemnified Party asserts under this
_ARTICLE IX_.

(g) For purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ , Covered Losses shall not include any
punitive, exemplary damages or consequential damages (unless, and only to the
extent, that any of the foregoing is awarded to a third party in a Third-Party
Claim, in which case such damages shall not be excluded from Covered Losses).
For purposes of this Agreement, "consequential damages" shall mean damages
that arise solely from the special circumstances of the Indemnified Party that
had not been communicated to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(h) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to any liability (including any
liability for Taxes) that is accrued (and then only to the extent thereof) on
the finally determined Statement or any amount that was the subject of a
dispute submitted to, and resolved by, the Accounting Firm pursuant to 
_Section 2.3(a)_ or that was resolved by the parties pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_.

(i) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnity pursuant _Section
9.1(a)_ to the extent the Covered Losses are a result of Buyers or any
Affiliate of Buyers voluntary (i) remedial actions or (ii) subsurface
sampling of soil or groundwater, except to the extent any of the foregoing is
(A) required by a Governmental Authority, Environmental Laws or any Permit,
(B) performed in connection with the defense or resolution of any third-party
Environmental Claim, (C) performed in connection with any maintenance, repair
or construction projects conducted in the ordinary course of business, or (D)
performed in connection with any Environmental Condition otherwise known to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to result in
a substantial threat to human health or the Environment. Neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall voluntarily solicit or

 



\- 64 -   request any Governmental Authority or other Person to make a claim with the
purpose of triggering the indemnity provisions of this Agreement.

 

(j) The sole source of indemnification for the Buyer Indemnitees from the
Shareholders under _Section 9.1(a)_ shall be a claim against the General
Escrow Account to the extent it has not otherwise been distributed or
otherwise depleted. Neither the Shareholders nor any of their respective
successors or assigns shall have any Liability personally under this 
_ARTICLE IX_. In addition, Buyer shall be entitled to set-off or recoup any
amounts that are finally determined to be due to Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ against any payment owed by Buyer under the
Royalty Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 9.1(j)_, "finally
determined" means a final, non-appealable resolution of the Liability Claim,
whether by consent, order, judgment, decree, settlement, arbitration award
or otherwise. If any Buyer Indemnitee has given a Claims Notice and the
Liability Claim has not been finally determined prior to the time scheduled
for any such payment under the Royalty Agreement, Buyer shall have the right,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to withhold from the amount
otherwise due with respect to such payment the amount or estimated amount of
such Liability Claim as set forth in the Claims Notice. Once such Liability
Claim is finally determined, Buyer shall (a) retain all or a portion of the
amount so withheld, to the extent the final determination of such claim is in
favor of the Buyer Indemnitees, and/or (b) distribute the remainder of the
amount withheld, if any, pursuant to the Royalty Agreement. In the event that
Buyer must distribute any amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section 9.1(j)_,
Buyer shall pay such amount plus interest accrued thereon from the date such
amount was otherwise due to the date it is paid at an interest rate equal to
the rate applicable to borrowings under Buyers revolving credit facility, as
may be in effect from time to time, during that same period, or, if no such
credit facility exists, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ as of the original due date of such payment.

9.2 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_.

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after any Seller Indemnitee, on the
one hand, or Buyer Indemnitee, on the other hand, becomes aware of any claim
that it has under _Section 9.1_ that may result in a Covered Loss (a "
_Liability Claim_ "), such party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give
notice thereof (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to Buyer or the Shareholder
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders), as the case may be (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "). A Claims Notice shall describe the Liability Claim
in such reasonable detail as is available, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Covered Loss that
has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay in or failure
to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 9.2(a)_ shall adversely affect any of the other
rights or remedies which the Indemnified Party has under this Agreement,
or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or failure has not materially
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



\- 65 -  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by
written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of
a Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party regarding a claim by a third party
(including any Governmental Authority) for which indemnity may be sought
hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), to assume and conduct the defense of
such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this
Agreement with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse
monetary judgment that is reasonably likely to result; and (ii) the Third-
Party Claim seeks (and continues to solely seek) monetary damages and, if
applicable, immaterial equitable claims that are ancillary to a claim for
monetary damages (the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), collectively, the " _Litigation Conditions_ "). In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance
with this _Section 9.2(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall have a forty-five
(45)day period (the " _Discovery Period_ ") following receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of the Claims Notice during which the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to reasonable discovery with respect to the indemnifiable
nature of the claims. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
reasonable cooperate with each other with respect to such discovery. If the
Indemnifying Party does not provide written notice to the Indemnified
Party by the end of the Discovery Period that it no longer continues to
assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the claims made in that Third-
Party Claim will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement as
within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 9.2(b)_, the Indemnified Party may continue to
defend the Third-Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party to the
extent the Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in this
_Section 9.2(b)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) any of the Litigation
Conditions cease to be met or (B) the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable, to the extent the Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable
hereunder, for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in
connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its
own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim which the other is
defending as provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if it shall
have assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this
Agreement, shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from,
any such Third-Party Claim which (x) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party
of a complete release from all Liability and Covered Losses in respect of such
Third-Party Claim, or (y) grants any injunctive or equitable relief. The
Indemnified Party shall not have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim
without 

 



\- 66 -   the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

9.3 _Survival; Limitations_. All of the representations and warranties of the
Shareholders and Buyer contained in _ARTICLE IV_  and _ARTICLE V_ ,
respectively, will survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force
and effect for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter, except that the
Fundamental Representations will not expire until the applicable statute of
limitations with respect thereto. Any Claims Notice with respect to any claim
for indemnification based on the representations and warranties in this
Agreement must identify the particular representation and warranty that is
claimed to have been breached, together with the underlying facts and Covered
Losses relating thereto, in each case, to the extent known, and must be given
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of
the survival period for such representation and warranty as set forth in the
preceding sentence. Any such Claims Notice given prior to such date may
continue to be asserted and shall continue to be indemnified against
thereafter. Any claim for indemnification hereunder that is not properly
asserted as provided herein may not be pursued and is hereby irrevocably
waived upon and after the expiration of the applicable period of survival.
Indemnification obligations hereunder that are not in respect of
representations and warranties shall survive the Closing indefinitely. The
representations and warranties of the parties shall not be affected or deemed
waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of any other party
or its representatives or by reason of the fact that such other party or any
of its representatives knew or should have known that any such representation
or warranty is or might be inaccurate or incorrect in any respect. For all
purposes of (i) determining whether there has been any misrepresentation of
or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.6(c)_ , _4.7_ (first sentence), _4.8(p)_ and  _4.19(a)_ ) and
(ii) calculating Covered Losses hereunder, any "material," "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded. 

9.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any payments made pursuant to _Sections
2.3_, _2.4_  and _9.1_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

9.5 _Contribution and Waiver_. From and after the Closing, no Shareholder
shall seek indemnification or contribution from the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including by reason of the fact that he or it was a director,
manager, officer, employee or agent of any such entity or was serving at the
request of any such entity as a partner, trustee, director, manager,
officer, employee or agent of another entity) for any breaches of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or in respect of any other payments
required to be made by any Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE IX_ ,
subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto following the Closing for any Liabilities
(including any Covered Losses) arising out of, based upon or otherwise in
respect of any misrepresentation or breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract
or tort,

 



\- 67 -   except for any claim based upon fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing,
following the Closing each of the parties hereto hereby expressly waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action it may have against the other parties hereto arising
under or based upon any Law (including any right or remedy under CERCLA), at
common law, tort or pursuant to any other theory or liability, other than the
right to seek indemnity pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that the provisions of this _Section 9.6_ shall not prevent or limit a
cause of action under _Section 11.12_ to obtain an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
conditions hereof.

 

ARTICLE X TERMINATION

10.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
10.2_, this Agreement may be terminated:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative at
any time prior to the Closing;

 

(b) by Buyer or the Shareholders Representative, if the Closing has not
occurred on or before the date that is 90 days after the date hereof (the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of such consummation shall be due to
the failure of the party wishing to terminate (which, in the case of a
proposed termination by the Shareholders Representative, shall mean the
Shareholders) to comply in all material respects with the agreements and
covenants contained herein;

(c) by the Shareholders Representative if there shall have been a
misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer contained in this Agreement such that the
condition set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, and which
shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days
following notice of such misrepresentation or breach, (ii) in the case of a
breach of the obligation to close within two (2) Business Days after the date
contemplated in _Section 3.1_, the date that is two (2) Business Days after
such contemplated date, and (iii) the Termination Date; 

(d) by Buyer if there shall have been a misrepresentation or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
Shareholders contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied, and which shall not have been cured
prior to the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days following notice of such
misrepresentation or breach, (ii) in the case of a breach of the obligation to
close within two (2) Business Days after the date contemplated in _Section
3.1_, the date that is two (2) Business Days after such contemplated date,
and (iii) the Termination Date;

(e) by either the Shareholders Representative or Buyer, by written notice to
the other, in the event that any Governmental Authority will have issued a
final, non-appealable Order, or adopted any applicable Law, in each case,
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements; or

 



\- 68 -  (f) by Buyer, by giving written notice to the Shareholders Representative
at any time prior to the Closing in the event the Shareholders Representative
has, within the previous ten (10) Business Days, delivered Updated Disclosure
Schedules to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.12_.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_
shall give written notice of such termination to the other party.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If any party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.1_, all obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate and none of the parties will have any Liability to the other parties
hereto other than under the Confidentiality Agreement (and any amendments
thereto) and under this  _Section 10.2_ and _ARTICLE XI_ , which provisions
will survive termination and remain in full force and effect without any
limitation whatsoever; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such termination shall
have been caused by, or shall have resulted from, (a) any willful and
material breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or (b) Buyers failure to
pay any portion of the Purchase Price at the Closing, then any such
termination shall not relieve any such breaching or failing party for Covered
Losses actually incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of any
such breach or failure, and/or from equitable relief.

 

ARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 _Waivers and Amendments_. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement (including any Schedule or Exhibit), and no waiver hereunder, shall
be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the
party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or
waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect
to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair
the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any
other time. Neither the waiver by any party hereto of a breach or of a default
under any provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party on one
or more occasions to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of
any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

11.2 _Shareholders Representative_. Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably
appoints the Shareholders Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for
each such Shareholder, for and on behalf of each such Shareholder, with full
power and authority to represent each Shareholder and such Shareholders
successors and assigns with respect to all matters arising under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and all actions taken by the Shareholders
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement will be binding
upon each such Shareholder and such Shareholders successors and assigns as
if expressly ratified and confirmed in writing by each of them. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholders Representative has
full power and authority, on behalf of each Shareholder and such
Shareholders successors and assigns, to interpret the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, to dispute or fail to dispute any Liability Claim under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, to negotiate and compromise any
dispute that may arise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and to
sign any releases or other

 



\- 69 -   documents with respect to such dispute. A Shareholder will be deemed a party
or a signatory to any agreement, document, instrument or certificate for which
the Shareholders Representative signs on behalf of such Shareholder. All
decisions, actions and instructions by the Shareholders Representative,
including the defense or settlement of any claims for which the Shareholders
may be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to  _ARTICLE IX_
, will be conclusive and binding on each Shareholder and no Shareholder has
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
Shareholders jointly and severally agree to pay, and to hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnitees from and against, any Liabilities or losses that the Buyer
Indemnitees may suffer or sustain as the result of any claim by any Person
that an action taken by the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the
Shareholders is not binding on, or enforceable against, the Shareholders.
Buyer has the right to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of
the Shareholders Representative as to the settlement of any claims for
indemnification by Buyer pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , or any other actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders Representative
hereunder, and no party hereto will have any cause of action against Buyer for
any action taken by Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of
the Shareholders Representative. The appointment of the Shareholders
Representative is an agency coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and
any action taken by the Shareholders Representative pursuant to the authority
granted in this  _Section 11.2_ is binding upon the executors, heirs, legal
representatives and successors of each Shareholder, and any references in this
Agreement to a Shareholder or the Shareholders means and includes the
successors to the Shareholders rights hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

11.3 _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other
communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement will be

11.4 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Baker and Hostetler LLP
and McCarthy, Lebit, Crystal and Liffman Co., L.P.A. have each represented the
Company, its

 



\- 71 -   Subsidiaries, the Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. All
of the parties recognize the commonality of interest that exists and will
continue to exist until Closing, and the parties agree that such commonality
of interest should continue to be recognized after Closing. Specifically, the
parties agree that Buyer shall not, and shall not cause the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, seek to have either Baker and Hostetler LLP or McCarthy,
Lebit, Crystal and Liffman Co., L.P.A. disqualified from representing the
Shareholders Representative, any Seller Indemnitee or their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with
any dispute that may arise between the Shareholders Representative, any Seller
Indemnitee or their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser
or the Company, on the other hand. In connection with any such dispute and
any Third-Party Claim for which the Shareholders have assumed the defense
under _Section 9.2(b)_ (other than any Third-Party Claim that is an Action by
or on behalf of a Governmental Authority), the Shareholders Representative
will have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether or not to waive
or assert any attorney client privilege that may apply to communications
between any of the Shareholders, and either Baker and Hostetler LLP or
McCarthy, Lebit, Crystal and Liffman Co., L.P.A. that occurred before the
Closing, in each case, only to the extent such communications relate to the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

11.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise
in this Agreement, each party will bear its own costs and expenses (including
attorneys, consultants, and advisors fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

11.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of its rights, interests
or obligations may be assigned by any party hereto, including by operation of
law, without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Buyer
may assign all or any part of its rights, obligations and duties under this
Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement to any one or more of its
Affiliates, provided that no such assignment shall in any way release Buyer
from any of its Liabilities under this Agreement.

11.7 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and shall

11.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

(b) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

11.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules,

instruments, communications and correspondence, whether

authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

11.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits, Disclosure
Schedules and other Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof. There may be included in the
Disclosure Schedules and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information
that are not "material," and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material," or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this
Agreement. Disclosures included in any section of the Disclosure Schedules
shall be considered to be made for purposes of all other sections of the
Disclosure Schedules to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure
to any other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent.
Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to a possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Governmental Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such breach or violation exists
or has occurred. Any capitalized term used in the Disclosure Schedules and not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to such term in this
Agreement. Any headings set forth in the Disclosure Schedules or
other Schedules are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
the meaning or interpretation of any of the disclosures set forth in such
schedules.

11.16 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience only, and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 

11.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. The electronic
transmission of any signed original counterpart of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the delivery of an original counterpart of this Agreement.

 

11.18 _Announcements_. No party shall issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior approval of the
other parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless and
only to the extent that such disclosure is required to be made in order
to satisfy such partys obligations under applicable securities Laws of the
United States of America.
