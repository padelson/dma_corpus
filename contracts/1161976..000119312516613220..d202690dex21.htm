ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be automatically canceled and shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Merger Sub-Owned Stock_. Any shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and
any

 



3  shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Stock Held by a Sponsor Entity, Parent or any of the Company s
Subsidiaries_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by a Sponsor
Entity, Parent or any of the Companys Subsidiaries shall automatically be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ or converted in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of Company
Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the
holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with 
_Section 2.2(b)_ without interest.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration and the parties shall enter into an agreement with the
Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed by the Exchange
Agent. The Company shall (i) prior to the Effective Time (and for the
avoidance of doubt, if the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ would be
satisfied), in accordance with applicable Law and in a manner consistent
with and subject to the provisions of this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, _Section 5.1_), take, or cause to be taken, such actions
as are necessary and appropriate such that Available Funds are, and on the
Closing Date will be, available to the Company in an amount equal to no less
than the Merger Consideration Amount and (ii) out of such Available Funds,
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent prior to the
Effective Time cash in immediately available funds in such aggregate amount
necessary to pay the Merger Consideration Amount. The Exchange Agent Agreement
shall provide that the Exchange Agent shall, if the Closing does not occur,
promptly return to the Company the Merger Consideration Amount deposited by
it (together with any interest earned thereon) with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_. The Merger Consideration Amount deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(a)_ shall, pending
its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent in (i)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any
interest and other income from such investments shall become part of the funds
held by the Exchange Agent for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration.
No investment by the Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration shall relieve
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from making the
payments required by this

 



4   _Article II_ and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent lost through any
investment made pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(a)_. No investment by the
Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration Amount shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, additional cash to pay the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Article II_ without interest.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock represented by one or more Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to
Closing and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. Upon
delivery to the Exchange Agent of a letter of transmittal by any record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, duly
completed and signed in accordance with its instructions, and surrender of the
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares of Company Common Stock, such record holder shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of a Book-Entry
Share shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such record holder shall
upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in customary form
(or such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Book-Entry Share of such
holder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A)
the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_
, without interest. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and the Depository
Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") with the objective that (x) if the Effective Time
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock held of
record by

 



5  DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time (such aggregate
cash amount, the " _DTC Cash Payment_ ") and (y) if the Effective Time occurs
after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date the DTC Cash Payment (with cash payment being delivered in immediately
available funds).

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Exchange Agent and
which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_ , and
thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article II_
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration, that may be
payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto, subject to the claims of
any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_.

 



6 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent
to deduct and withhold, from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, any such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payments under the Code, or under any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so deducted and withheld, and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, including _Section 2.1_, shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are
held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent
thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")
with respect to any such shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Dissenting Stockholder (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such
consideration for his, her or its Dissenting Shares as may be determined to be
due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Stockholders
Dissenting Shares. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right with respect to his,
her or its Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Stockholders Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such Dissenting Share, in accordance with _Section
2.1_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
any such demands.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

(a) Each stock option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) (each, an "
_Option_ ") shall be canceled and

 



7  terminated at the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without
interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock under such Option; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under any such Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof.

 

(b) Each RSU which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested) shall be canceled and terminated at
the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash, without interest and
less applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Cash
Payment")_ _._ With respect to each RSU granted prior to the date hereof
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the RSU Cash
Payment shall be made in accordance with _Section 2.4(e)_. With respect to
each RSU granted on or following the date hereof which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the RSU Cash Payment which a former
holder of the RSU may be eligible to receive shall (i) be earned subject to
the same vesting schedule and other vesting terms and conditions which applied
to such holders RSU as of the Effective Time (including upon certain
terminations of employment) and (ii) become payable, less applicable
withholding Taxes, on the applicable settlement date or dates that apply to
such RSU as of the Effective Time.

 

(c) Subject to the further provisions set forth in _Section 5.11(d)(3)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Performance Unit which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall be
canceled and terminated at the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in
cash, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, equal to
the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that
would be delivered to the holder of such Performance Unit assuming the target
achievement of the performance goals applicable to such award, and assuming
the satisfaction of all other conditions to such delivery and (ii) the Merger
Consideration.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Director Stock Unit shall be converted into
an obligation to pay, at the time specified in the Directors Deferred
Compensation Plan, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Director Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Merger Consideration. Such obligation shall be payable or distributable in
accordance with the terms of the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (and any
related deferral election) and, prior to the time of distribution, such
amounts shall be permitted to be deemed invested in an investment option under
the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan.

 

(e) The Company shall, prior to and effective upon the Effective Time (and for
the avoidance of doubt, if the condition set forth in  _Section 6.2(d)_
would be satisfied), in accordance with applicable Law and in a manner
consistent with and subject to the provisions of this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 5.1_), take, or cause to be taken, such
actions as are necessary and appropriate such that Available Funds are, and on

the Company Plans.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock or Contingent Company Equity of the Company shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company true, correct and complete copies of an executed debt commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof and corresponding fee letter dated as of
the date hereof (with only the fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic
"flex" terms redacted (none of which redacted provisions would adversely
affect the amount, conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing (as
defined below))) from the financial institutions identified therein (together
with all exhibits and schedules thereto, collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing to the Company or its Subsidiaries in the amounts set
forth therein for the purpose of funding, in part, the Transactions (the "
_Debt Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has

not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter

the Affected STF Amount (assuming for purposes of determining the Pro Forma
Liquidity Amount, the funding of at least $250,000,000 in connection with the
Debt Financing) after the payment of the Aggregate Consideration Amount in

Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in

parties thereto and is in full force and effect, in each case, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, (x) there is no
default or breach under the Debt Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other parties thereto, and (y) no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under the Debt Commitment
Letter, or a failure of any condition to the Debt Financing. As of the date
hereof, Parent has no Knowledge of any facts or circumstances or any reason to
believe that any facts or circumstances exist that, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ and the
completion of the Marketing Period, would be reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter not being
satisfied or the funding contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter not being
made available on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter is not subject to any conditions precedent to the 

 



31  obligations of the parties thereunder (including pursuant to any flex
provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) to make the full amount of
the Debt Financing available at the Closing, or any contingencies that would
permit the parties thereto to reduce the amount of the Debt Financing, other
than as expressly set forth therein. As of the date hereof, there are no side
letters, arrangements or other Contracts to which Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates is a party (a) which are related to the funding
of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (and the related fee letter) or (b) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timing of Closing, other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a correct and complete signed copy of
the Citi Credit Agreement Amendment, which assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the parties thereto (including the Company
or its applicable Subsidiaries) and satisfaction by the Company and its
applicable Subsidiaries of the conditions precedent set forth in Sections
5.1(b) and 5.1(c) thereof, is a valid and binding obligation of the parties
thereto, enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms

this Agreement, which has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
The Guarantee is valid, binding and in full force and effect as of the date
hereof and is enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms
except to the extent that such enforceability is subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, there is no default or breach under
the Guarantee by the Guarantor and no event has occurred, which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach under the Guarantee by the Guarantor.

Section 4.9  _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the accuracy at Closing of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ and
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (b) the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, (c) the
accuracy in all material respects, as of the Effective Time and immediately
following the Closing, of the information that is required under paragraph

or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 13E-3 will, as of the date of filing, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact

 



32  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and
Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in
such business plan information, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar,
that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business plan
information, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information or business plan information), except as otherwise set
forth herein. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that,
except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, has made or is making
any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plan information (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plan information).

Section 4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by Parent and Merger Sub in this
_Article IV_ or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person makes any representation
or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at Law or in equity,
with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates or their respective
business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise),

prohibited pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)(vi)(A)_, _Section 5.1(a)(vii)_,
_Section 5.1(a)(viii)(B)_, _Section 5.1(a)(xxvi)_ or _Section
5.1(a)(xxvii)_ (and, to the extent related to the foregoing clauses, _Section

taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries as soon as reasonably practicable.

expressly governed by _Section 5.14_ and not limited, expanded or qualified
by this _Section 5.1(c)_).

 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable
best efforts to conduct its retail natural gas and electricity businesses in a

Section 5.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3; Stockholders
Meeting_.

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall
prepare the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company with the preparation of the foregoing and (ii) the Company and Parent
shall, if required, jointly prepare 

 



39  the Schedule 13E-3. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement (or such earlier date as the Company determines in its sole
discretion), subject to the receipt from Parent and Merger Sub of the
information described in this _Section 5.2(a)_, the Company shall file the
Proxy Statement with the SEC, and, if required, the Company and Parent shall
jointly file the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC. The Company, with Parents
cooperation, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable to and use reasonable best efforts to resolve all
comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable and shall respond (with the cooperation
of, and after consultation with, each other as provided by this _Section
5.2_) as promptly as reasonably practicable to and use reasonable best efforts
to resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Schedule 13E-3 as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly provide the other with copies of all correspondence
between such party and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and
its staff, on the other hand, and promptly advise the other of any oral
comments received by such party and its Representatives from the SEC or its
staff, in each case, relating to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3,
as applicable. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days assuming (i) the good faith cooperation of
Parent and (ii) that the Company has concluded a "broker search" in accordance
with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act, _provided_ that the Company will use it
reasonable best efforts to conclude such broker search as soon as reasonably
practicable following the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay mailing
to the extent necessary to supplement or amend disclosure in the Proxy
Statement to reflect new facts or events if the Company has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such amended or
supplemented disclosure is necessary under applicable Law) after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement; but in no
event earlier than the No-Shop Period Start Date. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 will be made by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, without providing the Company or Parent, as applicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which comments to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall consider and implement in good faith;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to a
Superior Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any related
disclosures covering such matters. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the preparation
and filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, as applicable,
including promptly furnishing to each other in writing upon request any and
all information relating to a party or its Affiliates as may be required to be
set forth in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, under
applicable Law. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to a party hereto or its Affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by such party which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3, as applicable, would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, such party shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto so that an appropriate amendment or supplement may be filed with the
SEC describing such information and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



40 (b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and NYSE rules,
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to
consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), which Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be held on a date mutually agreed upon by the
Company and Parent that is as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, but in no
event earlier than the Cut-Off Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall be permitted to delay, adjourn or postpone convening the Company
Stockholders Meeting (i) with the prior written consent of Parent, (ii) for
the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting but only for such amount of time as the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is
necessary under applicable Law or (iv) for up to ten (10) Business Days to
allow additional time to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approvals; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall, if requested by Parent, delay, adjourn or postpone convening the
Company Stockholders Meeting (x) for the absence of quorum or (y) for up to
ten (10) Business Days to allow additional time to solicit additional proxies
if necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approvals. The
Company agrees that no matters shall be brought before the Company
Stockholders Meeting other than the adoption of this Agreement, the related
"golden parachute" vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any
related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the
meeting to solicit additional votes).

(c) The Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall, subject
to the right of the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_, (i) recommend to its stockholders that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and
that the Company Stockholder Approvals be given (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and (ii) subject to _Section 5.3_, use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approvals, including to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
Subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall keep Parent informed
on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy
tallies following the mailing of the Proxy Statement.

physical or electronic "data room" or analogous access to information. Except

public information in connection with, any Alternative Proposal or any
proposal, offer, inquiry or request for information or request for
negotiations or discussions that would reasonably be expected to lead to any

enforce any provision (including any standstill or similar provision) of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any confidentiality, standstill

reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, or (y) grant any waiver, amendment or release
under any Anti-Takeover Statutes or (z) resolve, agree or propose to do any
of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the
Company

 



42  Stockholder Approvals, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its
or their respective Representatives receives an Alternative Proposal in
writing, which Alternative Proposal did not result from any material breach
of this _Section 5.3_, the Company, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees and other Representatives shall have the right to engage in
negotiations and discussions with, or furnish any information and other
access to, any Person making such Alternative Proposal and any of its
Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that
such Alternative Proposal is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (x) prior to engaging in any such
negotiations or discussions or furnishing any non-public information or

Confidentiality Agreement with the Person making such Alternative Proposal and
(y) the Company also provides Parent, substantially concurrently with
providing it to any such other Person, any material non-public information or
access with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to such
other Person which was not previously furnished to Parent, except to the
extent providing Parent with such information would violate any federal,
state, provincial, municipal, county, local or foreign Law to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject. Notwithstanding the occurrence
of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described
in _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party, including with
respect to any amended proposal submitted by any Excluded Party, so long as
such Person continues to be an Excluded Party, following the No-Shop Period
Start Date until the earlier of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern time) on August 1, 2016

an Excluded Party; _provided_ that the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
directors, officers, employees and other Representatives comply in all
material respects with the requirements of this  _Section 5.3_, including
the information requirements of _Section 5.3(a)_. Following the No-Shop

their directors, officers, employees and other Representatives to, keep
Parent informed on a reasonably current basis (and in any event within 36
hours or, if any 12 consecutive hours of such period fall on a Saturday or
Sunday, within 48 hours) of the existence, status and terms and conditions of
any Alternative Proposal or any proposal, offer, inquiry or request for
information or request for negotiations or discussions that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, including the price and form
of consideration and all material terms and conditions thereof (and the

within 36 hours or, if any 12 consecutive hours of such period fall on a
Saturday or Sunday, within 48 hours) provide Parent with a copy of such
written Alternative Proposal (or such written proposal, offer, inquiry or
request, as applicable). For the avoidance of doubt, any breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by the Companys Subsidiaries or by any directors, officers or
other Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to

Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, provided none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their directors, officers, employees or other
Representatives have materially breached this _Section 5.3_, (i) after the
date hereof and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approvals
are obtained, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of the type
described in clauses (i), (ii) or (vii) (solely with respect to the actions
described in clauses (i) and (ii)) of the definition thereof solely in
response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (ii) prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained,

44  any other material documents in respect of such Superior Proposal and states
the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice_ ")
(it being understood that such Notice shall not in itself be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and that any material change to (x) the facts or
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event or (y) the terms of such
Superior Proposal (including any change to the economic terms thereof), as
applicable, shall require a new Notice and, in such case, all references to
four (4) Business Days in this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall be deemed to be three
(3) Business Days (each such four or three Business Day Period, a " _Notice
Period_ ")); (B) during such Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall, and shall make available and direct its necessary
Representatives to, discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parent and
Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; and (C) following such Notice Period, (x) in the

any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger to which
Parent and Merger Sub would agree, determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (y) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger to which Parent
and Merger Sub would agree, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that any such
purported termination to enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior
Proposal shall not be effective unless and until the Company pays the
Termination Fee in full.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the

duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with applicable
Law, (iii) in response to an inquiry, responding to inform any Person of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_ or (iv) making
any "stop, look and listen" statement pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act. No disclosures under this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall be, in
themselves, a breach of this _Section 5.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall be deemed to modify or supplement the
definition of (or the requirements pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with
respect to a) "Company Adverse Recommendation Change", and any public

14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) by the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof relating to any determination, position or other action
by the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to any Intervening

Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

(g) No later than one (1) Business Day after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Person

Unaffiliated Stockholders than the Transactions from a financial perspective,
taking into account, to the extent applicable, the legal, financial,
regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement that
the Company Board considers relevant, and to be reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that for purposes of
the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "20%" in the

Proposal; _provided_ that any such Person or group of Persons shall cease to
be an Excluded Party upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the
ultimate equityholder(s) of such Person and the other Persons who were members
of such group, if any, as of immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date cease to constitute in the aggregate at least 50% of the equity

if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral

may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Counsel" only and any such information
shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents
of the other party without approval of the party providing the non-public
information. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this

49  or their respective Subsidiaries, committing or causing, in each case, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to
provide and maintain, as applicable, any additional assets, guarantee or
other commitment, in each case, from the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iv), if such action should be reasonably necessary to (x) avoid,
prevent or eliminate the actual or threatened commencement of any litigation
or other administrative or judicial action or Proceeding by a Governmental

Transactions, so long as such agreement, commitment, condition, settlement or
Order is expressly conditioned on the Closing occurring; (3) none of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or be required to

Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the assets thereof are or will be
bound the effectiveness of which is not expressly conditioned upon the

their respective Subsidiaries or any Specified Entity to make any investment,

third party ( _provided_ that the Company has used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at Parents sole cost and expense with respect to any
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses related thereto, the
consent of such counterparty to the Contract or such third party to whom
the confidentiality obligation owes) or jeopardize the protection of the
attorney-client privilege; _provided_ that in each case described in this
clause (iii) the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially

Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Board shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as

was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), arising out of or related to such Indemnitees service
as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such capacity) at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or
the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability, exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the extent provided in (A) the
Company Charter Documents and the respective organizational documents of each
of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof and (B) any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee or similar rights of an
Indemnitee under Company policies, as in effect on the date hereof, which
shall in each case survive in accordance with their terms. Without limiting
the foregoing, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors
and officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnitees no less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the
Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions,
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Claim
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 5.8_ or the
enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this  _Section 5.8_ as and when
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses (but only to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company
Charter Documents, applicable organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the
Company or applicable indemnification agreements or policies).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.8_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any Claim, without consent of the applicable
Indemnitee, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or 

 



53  termination includes no admission of guilt or wrong-doing and includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Nothing in this
_Section 5.8(c)_ shall relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of its
obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

 

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to cause to be maintained in effect the coverage
provided by the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to acts or omissions occurring
before the Effective Time either through the Companys existing insurance
provider or another provider reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
in excess of 350% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may, prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy that provides
coverage and substantially equivalent benefits as the coverage described
above, in which case no party shall have any further obligation to purchase or
pay for insurance hereunder;  _provided_ that the Company shall not, in
respect of such prepaid "tail" policy spend in excess of 350% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company for its directors and officers liability
insurance coverage prior to the date hereof.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.8_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this  _Section 5.8_ applies unless (A)
such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.8_).

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall (a) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or any of its directors or officers relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, (b) afford Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on filings and responses related thereto,
which comments the Company shall consider in good faith and (c) keep Parent
apprised of, and consult with Parent with respect to, proposed strategy and
any significant decisions related thereto. No settlement or offer of
settlement of any such stockholder litigation shall be agreed to or made
without Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably

 



54  withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Parent and the Company shall
notify the other promptly of the commencement of any such stockholder
litigation of which it has received notice.

 

Section 5.10 _Section 16_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect to
such equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is or becomes
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

Section 5.11  _Employee Matters_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), with the exception of
employees represented by any labor organization, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) as of
the Effective Time (each such employee not represented by a labor
organization, a " _Company Employee_ "), for so long as the Company Employee
is employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries during
the Continuation Period, (i) an annualized base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, and short-term and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall take into account the value
attributable to cash and equity based compensation opportunities for purposes
of determining the Company Employees annual total direct compensation
opportunity) that are no less favorable than the same provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, incentive compensation and retiree
welfare benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the same
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the
Continuation Period under circumstances set forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule with severance benefits no less favorable than
as set forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or, if
more favorable, than as required by applicable local Law. With respect to
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who are represented by a labor
organization, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor all existing collective
bargaining agreements applicable to such employees as may remain in effect,
and as may be modified from time to time.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the
" _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans, (ii) for 

 



55  purposes of each New Plan providing welfare benefits, Parent shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for any Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were satisfied,
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company Plan as of the Effective
Time and (iii) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred on or before
the Effective Time by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
to be taken into account under any New Plan for purposes of satisfying any
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor all Company
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time and the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control", "change of control" or "corporate transaction", as applicable,
under such Company Plans.

(d) Parent and the Company agree to the matters set forth in _Section
5.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

any Company Plan or New Plan or treated as an amendment or modification to
any Company Plan or New Plan, (ii) subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this _Section 5.11_, obligate Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or retain
the employment or services of any particular employee, director or consultant

modifying or terminating any compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement or (y) terminating the employment or services of, or changing
the terms and conditions of employment or services of any employee, director

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.7_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
or entity, including any current or former employee, officer, director or

effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect
of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any flex provisions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof)), (ii) add conditions to the
Debt Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any conditions to the

expected to result in a material breach or default) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Documents, (ii) Parent or Merger Sub
receives any written notice or other written communication (including email),

Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney-client privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege. Subject to _Section 5.14(h)_, if any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall (x)
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and to the Knowledge of the
Parent, the reason therefor and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and cause to be obtained, as promptly as practicable, in replacement
thereof alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount (for the avoidance of doubt,

business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, encumber any of
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, or

respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)

in excess of the Maximum Aggregate Liability.

 

(k) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are integral parts of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements, the Parent Entities and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, would not enter into this Agreement. Each
of the parties further acknowledges and agrees that payment of
the Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and
when required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, shall not constitute a penalty
but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this  _Article VIII_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

 

(b) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Debt Financing Source, or any of its representatives, in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction. In addition, each
of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
parties hereto by this Agreement irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert,
by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or 

 



74  otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance
with _Section 8.8(a)_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. No party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates,
will bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, anywhere other than in
(A) any New York State court sitting in the County of New York or (B) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Section 8.9 _Remedies_. Subject to the remainder of this  _Section 8.9_,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. Subject to the foregoing and to the following
sentence, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the parties hereto shall be entitled, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or a decree or order to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any
of the courts referred to in _Section 8.8_, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parents obligation to effect the Closing shall be subject to
the requirements that (i) all conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as
of such date) have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived
at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to
_Section 1.2_ hereof, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or applicable
Definitive Documents or would be funded in accordance with such terms at the
Closing if Parent were to effect the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2_
and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded and Parent
effects the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2_, then the Closing will occur.
Subject to this _Section 8.9_, each party hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this

 



75   _Section 8.9_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including, subject to the limitations herein, monetary damages) in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.9_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this _Section 8.9_
shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 8.9 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article VII_ (or seeking any other form of relief that may be available to a
party under this Agreement (including, subject to the limitations herein,
monetary damages)). For the avoidance of doubt, while any party may, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with this _Section 8.9_ and subject to the
limitations herein, payment of monetary damages, the payment of the
Termination Fee, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, or
expense reimbursement (as applicable), under no circumstances shall any party
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
requiring consummation of the Merger and any such payments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and its Affiliates
hereby (i) waive any rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing
Sources in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (ii) agree
not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and
not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation,
litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the remedy of
specific performance shall not be available to the Company with respect to 
_Section 5.4(e)_.

Section 8.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.10_.
