vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 26, 2017 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among HOME POINT FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a New Jersey corporation
(" _Parent_ "), LONGHORN MERGER SUB, INC., an Ohio corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and STONEGATE MORTGAGE
CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have (a) determined that it is advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub
will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and (b) approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and certain
directors, executive officers and stockholders of the Company are entering
into voting and support agreements dated as of the date hereof (each, a "
_Voting Agreement_ "), in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit A_;

 

WHEREAS, (a) the Company has certain net operating losses for United States
federal income Tax purposes; (b) Parent and the Company desire to avoid an
"ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), prior to the consummation of the Merger and (c)
in furtherance of such objective and as a condition to the willingness of
Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and as an inducement and in
consideration therefor, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. are entering into a
Tax Asset Protection Plan (the " _TAP Plan_ "); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio (the "
_OGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company. The Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State
of Ohio unaffected by the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 



1 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street,
New York, New York, on a date which shall be no later than three (3)
business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties (the " _Closing
Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Ohio on the Closing Date (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the OGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 1.5(b)_ and _Section 2.4_,
each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $8.00, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Excluded Shares_ " means, collectively, (i) shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by any Subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined and to the extent provided in
_Section 2.4_). In the event that the Company issues shares of any series of
preferred stock (" _TAP Plan Preferred Stock_ ") in lieu of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the TAP Plan prior to the Effective Time, each such
one ten-thousand of a share of TAP Plan Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 1.5(b)_,
and such amount shall be considered Merger Consideration for purpose of this
Agreement.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ," _it being understood_ that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to non-certificated
book-entry account arrangements for the ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right 

 



2  to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.5_.
Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company (or any other securities convertible therefor or exchangeable
thereto) shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), subdivision, combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, merger or other similar change in capitalization (including the
issuance of Company Common Stock or TAP Plan Preferred Stock pursuant to the
TAP Plan or otherwise as a result of any exercise of Rights (as defined in the
TAP Plan)), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change (it being further understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that,
other than as a result of the vesting or exercise of any Company Equity Awards
(as defined below), or any action that is otherwise permitted by this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay an aggregate Merger
Consideration amount that is higher than the aggregate Merger Consideration as
of the date hereof); _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 1.5(b)_ shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all Excluded Shares shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor, subject to any rights that a holder of Dissenting Shares
may have under _Section 2.4_ or the OGCL.

1.6 _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") shall
be converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a
holder of a Company Stock Option (as defined below) and Parent, each option
granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the
Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Company 2013 Omnibus Incentive
Compensation Plan, the Company 2013 Non-Employee Director Plan and the Company
Amended and Restated 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the holder of such
Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than the
Companys first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least five (5)
business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ by
(y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of 

 



3  Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a
holder of a Company RSU (as defined below) and Parent, (i) any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit subject only
to service-based vesting conditions (a " _Company RSU_ ") under the Company
Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, and (ii) each Company RSU shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the holder of such Company RSU
to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than the Companys first regularly
scheduled payroll date that is at least five (5) business days after the
Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied_ by (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ , that
with respect to any Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to
be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement that
will not trigger a Tax or penalty under section 409A of the Code. 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and its Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate
the treatment of the Company Stock Options and Company RSUs (collectively, the
" _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to this  _Section 1.7_. The Company
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the
Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the amended and restated articles of incorporation of the Company (the "
_Company Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
without any amendment or modification until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable Law.

 

1.9 _Code of Regulations of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the
amended and restated code of regulations of the Company (the " _Company Code
of Regulations_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law.

or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and engaged pursuant to an
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Stockholders_ "), a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be
paid to the Stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.2_.

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than three (3) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.5(a)_, a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form,
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or, in
the case of book-entry account arrangements, a customary "agents message") to
the Exchange Agent, and contain such other provisions as Parent, the Company
and the Exchange Agent may reasonably agree) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to
holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_ and subject to _Section 2.4_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration.

(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the proper amount of cash shall be paid to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

 



5 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with
the procedures in this _Section 2.2_.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be paid to Parent. Any former Stockholders who
have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former Stockholder for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates immediately prior to such time on which the Exchange Fund would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent (or,
at Parents election, the Surviving Corporation), free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the Merger Consideration (or any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement) such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Payment of Company Equity Awards_. Parent shall take all actions
necessary so that, no later than the Companys first regularly scheduled
payroll date that is at least five (5) business days after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a
Company Equity Award the amounts to which such holder is

 



6  entitled as determined in accordance with _Section 1.7_ through the payroll
system of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary, to the
extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving Corporation has
insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Company Equity
Awards, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of, or
consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all of the
provisions of the OGCL concerning the rights of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock to require payment of fair cash value of such Company Common
Stock (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), in accordance with Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration but shall instead be entitled to payment of
such consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section
1701.85 of the OGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 1.5_ upon surrender of the Certificates
representing such shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) (i) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company
relating to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and (ii) Parent shall have the right
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make, or offer to make, any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demand, or agree to any such appraisal demands.

Except as disclosed in (a) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure

an admission by the Company that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) any disclosures made with
respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any
other section of this _Article III_ specifically referenced or cross-
referenced therein and (2) other sections of this _Article III_ to the extent
it is

 



7 _ _ reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from reading only the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections, or (b) any Company Reports filed
by the Company on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding any exhibits to any filed Company Reports or risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature); _provided_ , that nothing in the Company Reports

Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1_
_(Corporate Organization)_ , _Section 3.2_ _ (Capitalization)_ , _Section
3.3_ _(Authority; No Violation)_ , _Section 3.7_ _(Broker s Fees)_, _Section
3.18_ _(State Takeover Laws)_ or _Section 3.19_ _(Opinion)_ , the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:
__

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Ohio. The Company has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. True and
complete copies of the Company Charter and the Company Code of Regulations as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement have previously been
made available by the Company to Parent and the Company is not in violation
of its organizational or governing documents. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the Company,
any fact, change, event, occurrence or development (an " _Effect_ ") that (i)
has a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , that, with
respect to this clause (i), Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be
deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of
war or acts of terrorism) or in general economic or market (including equity,
credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions, (C)
changes, including changes in applicable Laws, after the date hereof, to the
housing market, residential mortgage market or residential Mortgage Loan
industry generally, (D) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement,
public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any effect on the Companys and its Subsidiaries relationships
with its customers or employees) or actions expressly required by this
Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby ( _it being
understood_ that, for purposes of _Section 3.3(b)_ and _Section 3.4_, the
exceptions set forth in this clause (D) shall not apply in determining whether
a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred), or (E) a decline, in and of
itself, in the trading price of the Company Common Stock or the failure, in
and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts (
_it being understood_ that the underlying cause of such decline or failure may
be taken into account in determining whether 

 



8  a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred); except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B) or (C) to the extent that any Effects are
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or (ii) prevents
or would reasonably be expected to prevent the ability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to perform in all material respects its obligations under
this Agreement and to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the terms hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any person, any other person of which at
least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such person and/or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly organized and validly existing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to
do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in
good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case, as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and each is in full force and effect.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par

Stock (the " _Warrants_ "), and (vii) no other shares of capital stock or

outstanding. All the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been, and all shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued from and
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time upon exercise
or settlement of the Company Equity Awards and the Warrants will be, when
issued, duly authorized and validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, any purchase option, call option or right of first
refusal or similar rights with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No

 



9  Subsidiary of the Company owns shares of Company Common Stock. There are no
outstanding or existing bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into and exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which Stockholders may
vote (" _Company Voting Debt_ "). Other than the Company Equity Awards and the
Warrants disclosed pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 3.2(a)_,
there are no outstanding or existing (i) subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities (ii) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock
rights, profit participations, performance rights to the ownership or earning
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity-based awards, or any
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are linked to the
value of the Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
any Subsidiaries of the Company (the foregoing clauses (i)-(ii),
collectively, " _Company Equity Securities_ "), or (iii) voting trusts,
stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to
the voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests
of Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever ("
_Liens_ "), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof.

(c) _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
January 26, 2017, a true and complete list of all Company Equity Awards
outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i)
the name of each holder of Company Equity Awards, (ii) the number of shares
subject to each Company Equity Award, (iii) the grant date of each Company
Equity Award, and (iv) the exercise price for each Company Stock Option.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any indebtedness for borrowed money (other than indebtedness
for borrowed money owed by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company to the Company or another direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company).

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of
this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote (the "
_Requisite Company Vote_ ") at a duly held meeting of the Stockholders (the "
_Company Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly
called at which a quorum of directors of the Company was present, has
unanimously adopted resolutions (i)

 



10  determining that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
and the Stockholders, (ii) adopting this Agreement and approving the
Companys execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, including the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) resolving to recommend that the Stockholders approve this Agreement
(the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and directing that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Stockholders for adoption
at the Company Meeting. Such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn
as of the date of this Agreement. Except for (i) the approval of this
Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote and (ii) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger as required by the OGCL, no other vote or corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
Stockholders are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by both Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and general equity principles (the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will not
(i) subject to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, conflict with or result
in a violation of any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Code
of Regulations, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 3.4_, subject to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, violate any
Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, or (iii) violate, conflict with, result in a
breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement, commitment or other instrument or
obligation, whether written or oral (each, a " _Contract_ "), to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
this clause (iii)) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) (1) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of a proxy statement in
preliminary and definitive form relating to the Company Meeting (including the
notice of meeting and form of proxy, and any other document incorporated by
reference therein, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") and (2) the filing with the SEC of such reports under,
and such other compliance with, the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, and
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, as may be required
in connection with this Agreement or the Merger, (b) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of

required applications, filings or notices with any court, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority (each, a " _Governmental
Entity_ "), including any Regulatory Agency, set forth in _Section 3.4_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (e) such other consents, approvals,
filings or registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on a
timely basis, no consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with,
any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (i) the execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or (ii) the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.5 _Company Reports_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished
all reports, forms, registrations, statements and other documents, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were
required to file or furnish with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "
_Exchange Act_ ") (collectively, together with all exhibits, financial
statements and schedules thereto, and all information incorporated therein by
reference, but excluding the Proxy Statement, the " _Company Reports_ "). At
the time of its filing or being furnished, each of the Company Reports
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with
or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of
the Company Reports. None of the Companys Subsidiaries are required to file
or furnish with or to the SEC any periodic or current reports pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable listing and governance rules and regulations of NYSE (the " _New
York Stock Exchange_ "). To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of
this Agreement, none of the Company Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC
review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Each of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and

 



12  records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, consolidated cash
flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods shown or as of the respective
dates set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as
of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods and as of the
dates involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. KPMG LLP
has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or
in connection with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due) required by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company, except for those liabilities that are (i) reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 or
any of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March
31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 (including any notes thereto),
(ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since December 31, 2015, or (iii) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to be, either
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company. The Company has (x)
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including
its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the
Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material

 



13  weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made by management to the Companys
outside auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and a copy of any such disclosure has been made available to
Parent. The Company has no reason to believe that the Companys outside
auditors and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since December 31, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,

an admission by Parent or Merger Sub that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) any disclosures made
with respect to a section of _Article IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any

of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings
(including approval of stockholders) on the part of either Parent or Merger
Sub are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and

provisions hereof, will not (i) violate, conflict with or result in a
violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) assuming

properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of

efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable following its filing with the SEC. The Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed or delivered as promptly as
practicable after the SEC staff advises the Company that it has no further

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (i) the draft of the Proxy
Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and (ii) all
written responses to requests for additional information by and replies to
written comments of the SEC staff, and the Company will, in each case, (x)

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required by
applicable Law, and (x) provide to Parent copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect thereto. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any
party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the

their respective representatives, nor shall Parent, the Company or any of
their respective representatives be entitled to review such materials of such
Fund, any of its affiliates or any of its representatives; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this
sentence shall relieve any Fund of its obligation to provide any and all
information reasonably required by any such Governmental Entity or Regulatory

shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers, stockholders and, in the
case of Parent, Home Point Capital Inc. and Stone Point Capital LLC (" _Stone
Point_ "), and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity, including any Regulatory Agency, whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be obtained
or that the receipt of any such approval will be delayed.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, (i) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors and other representatives of Parent access, during normal business
hours, to its offices, employees, properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems and records (other
than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement) and (ii) make available to Parent such other information concerning
the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (other than information that the Company is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
include personally identifiable information of the Companys customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Parent shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to _Section
6.2(a)_ in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated March 16, 2016, between
Stone Point and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



44 (c) No investigation, or information received pursuant to any such
investigation, by either of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other set forth herein.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either the Company or
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the other prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

(e) The Company shall take, or cause to be taken, the actions set forth in
_Section 6.2(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Company
shall provide to Parent copies of monthly financial statements of the Company
in the form substantially consistent with those made available to the Board of
Directors of the Company, as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event
within two (2) business days after such information is made available to the
Board of Directors of the Company), beginning with the month ending
immediately following the date of this Agreement, which in all cases shall
be prepared from, and in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company; _provided_ that in no event shall the monthly financial statements of
the Company be provided to Parent later than the twenty-first (21st) calendar
day following the end of the applicable month (other than with respect to
monthly financial statements of the Company for the last month of any fiscal
quarter, which shall be provided to Parent no later than the last calendar day
of the month following the applicable month).

6.3 _Stockholders  Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall take, in accordance with the OGCL, the Company Charter
and the Company Code of Regulations and the rules of the NYSE, all action
necessary to establish a record date and duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, with
the date of such meeting to be set after consultation with Parent. The
adoption of this Agreement, the adjournment or postponement of the Company
Meeting due to the absence of a quorum or if the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote, and, if applicable, the advisory vote
required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act shall be the only matters
which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Stockholders at the
Company Meeting, unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Company
may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Company Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such Company Meeting, or if on
the date of such Company Meeting the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote; _provided_ , that the Company may not adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting more than a total of two (2) times or for an aggregate of more
than fifteen (15) calendar days without Parents prior written consent.

 



45 (b) Subject to _Section 6.9_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Stockholders the Requisite
Company Vote, including by communicating to the Stockholders the Company
Recommendation and (ii) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall, if requested by Parent, engage a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from Stockholders relating to the Requisite Company Vote.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_ of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall each, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on
such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one-
year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time for so long as such
employee is employed during the Continuation Period (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary, base wage rate or commission
schedule, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary, base
wage rate or commission schedule, as applicable, provided by Parent to its
similarly-situated employees, (ii) short-term cash incentive opportunities no
less favorable than the short-term cash incentive opportunities provided by
Parent to its similarly-situated employees, (iii) long-term incentive
opportunities that are substantially comparable to the long-term incentive
opportunities provided by Parent to its similarly-situated employees, and
(iv) retirement, health and welfare and other employee benefits (excluding
severance, short-term cash incentive opportunities and long-term or equity-
based incentive opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the retirement, health and welfare and other employee benefits
(excluding severance, short-term cash incentive opportunities and long-term or
equity-based incentive opportunities) provided by Parent to its similarly-
situated employees. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
each Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the Continuation
Period with (x) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits for which such Continuing
Employee was eligible immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) during
the period after the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date and through
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, severance benefits that are no
less favorable than the severance benefits provided by Parent to its
similarly-situated employees.

 



46 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods conditions were satisfied
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and
its eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in
the plan year in which the Closing occurs, and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and, with respect to vacation, paid-time off or severance
only, determination of the level of benefit, in any New Plan (other than any
New Plan that is an equity based plan or long-term incentive plan) to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the most closely
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer
premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan, or (z) to any benefit plan
that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans set forth in _Section
6.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule will occur at the Effective Time.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit
Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
final sentence of _Section 9.12_, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever (including the creation of any third party beneficiary
rights) under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



47 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and former director, officer
and employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person
and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified
Party, and the Company Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that Parent may
substitute therefor policies from an insurer with the same or better credit
rating of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time (including the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300%
of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, with the
prior consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six
(6)-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy providing coverage equivalent to the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date hereof if and to the extent

 



48  that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a "tail" policy, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
under this _Section 6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified
Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.6_
without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or
other affected person.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer
all or substantially all of its assets or liabilities to any other entity or
engage in any similar transaction, then in each case to the extent the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_ are not otherwise transferred
and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation of Law or otherwise,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.6_.

6.7  _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

 

6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand (in such capacity, the " _Notifying Party_ "), shall each promptly
advise the other party of any change or event (i) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of the Notifying Partys representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually
or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ (if the Company is the Notifying Party) or  _Section
7.3_ (if Parent is the Notifying Party); _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section 6.8_ or the failure of
any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied,
or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to
give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied.

 



49 6.9 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, employees and controlled affiliates and
its and their agents, advisors, consultants, and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries,
offers or proposals, or the making, submission or announcement of inquiries,
offers or proposals, which constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate or continue
any discussions or any negotiations with any person concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, except to
notify a person that makes an inquiry with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
of the existence of the provisions of this  _Section 6.9(a)_, (iv) approve,
endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
agreement in principle relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal, including by granting any waiver, amendment or release
under any standstill agreement or any standstill provision of any other
contract or agreement (except that the Board of Directors of the Company, or
any committee thereof, may grant any such waiver, amendment or release if it
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law) or any Takeover Statutes
or (vi) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , that, prior to the time that the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited, _bona fide_ ,
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section 6.9_, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and,
with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor (x) constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (y) could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may, and may authorize its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to
the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor) that the failure to take the
foregoing actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and shall expressly permit
the Companys compliance with the provisions of this Agreement (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any nonpublic information to be provided to such third
party that was not previously provided to Parent. The Company will, and will
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent and its affiliates and
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, including by
terminating all physical and electronic data room access previously

 



50  granted to any such person or its Representatives, and the Company shall
promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any such other person (subject to the
terms of any confidentiality agreement with each such person). The Company
will promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys
knowledge of such event) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including, subject to
the terms of any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company
prior to the date hereof, the material terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and copies
of all written requests, proposals, offers or proposed agreements received by
the Company), and will keep Parent reasonably and promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) informed of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.
As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any proposal or offer from
Parent or any of its affiliates, whether in one transaction or in a series of
transactions, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including capital stock
of the Companys Subsidiaries), revenue or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or one or more of the Companys Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of
the consolidated assets of the Company (the " _Material Subsidiaries_ "), (ii)
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer which, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or one or more of
the Material Subsidiaries, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or one or more
of the Material Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.9_, neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or adopt, approve or recommend
(publicly or otherwise) or propose or resolve to adopt, approve or
recommend (publicly or otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal;

__(ii) (A) take formal action or make any recommendation or public statement
in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer relating to securities of
the Company other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (B) within ten (10) business days of a
tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company having been
commenced, fail to publicly recommend against such tender or exchange offer
or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation or (C) following the
announcement by a third party of a _bona fide_

 



51  Acquisition Proposal by such third party, fail to reaffirm publicly the
Company Recommendation within ten (10) business days after Parent requests in
writing that the Company Recommendation be reaffirmed publicly ( _provided_ ,
that Parent shall only be permitted to make one such request under clause (C)
in connection with any single Acquisition Proposal by a third party) (any of
the actions described in the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ " ); or

 

(iii) authorize, cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement or a letter of
intent or agreement in principle with respect thereto (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Requisite Company
Vote is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) either cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_
or effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving the actions
described in _Section 6.9(b)(i)_ if (A) the Company receives an unsolicited,
_bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 6.9_ (and such proposal is not withdrawn) and (B)
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (either such action, a " _Superior Proposal
Event_ "), or (ii) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving
the actions described in _Section 6.9(b)(i)_ in response to an Intervening
Event (as defined below) (such action, an " _Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) if the Board
of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters,
its financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
take any actions under this sentence unless (A) it gives Parent at least three
(3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice, if concerning an intended Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change, shall include a description of the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail or, if concerning a Superior Proposal Event, shall specify
the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third
party making, any such Superior Proposal or any amendment or modification
thereof, and include an unredacted copy of any proposal letter and the latest
draft agreements relating to such Superior Proposal (including exhibits
and schedules, if any)), (B) after providing such notice and prior to taking
such action, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent indicates in writing
a desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would permit the Company not to effect a Superior
Proposal Event or an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change, and (C)
at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have considered in good faith any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and (x) with respect to an intended Intervening
Event Adverse Recommendation Change, shall have determined in good faith that
failure to effect an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the

 



52  directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) with respect to an
intended Superior Proposal Event, shall have determined that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes
were to be given effect and that failure to effect the Superior Proposal Event
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be
a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.9_ and will
require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section 6.9_. As used in
this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited,
written Acquisition Proposal (with all references to "20%" being deemed to be
replaced by references to "50%") for which the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, (x) is
more likely than not to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal and such other factors that are deemed relevant by
the Board of Directors of the Company, and (y) if consummated, would be more
favorable to the Stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
6.9_). As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means an Effect
(other than any Effect resulting from a material breach of this Agreement by
the Company) that was not known to the Board of Directors of the Company as of
the date hereof and becomes known to the Board of Directors of the Company
after the date hereof and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained; _provided_ , that the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal, or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, shall
not constitute an Intervening Event.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or from making any legally required disclosure to the Stockholders; _provided_
, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any
action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement,
including whether there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

6.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press
release. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
develop a joint communications plan to ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby

nor Parent shall issue any press release or, to the extent practical,
otherwise make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the

Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

6.13 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Each of the Company and Parent shall take
such actions reasonably required to cause the shares of Company Common Stock

related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the
members of the Board of Directors or the board of directors of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent of any such
Transaction Litigation of which it has received notice, give Parent
the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such
litigation and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company agrees that it shall not compromise, offer to settle,
agree to any settlement of or come to any arrangement regarding any such
litigation without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall notify the
Company promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of the
commencement of any such Transaction Litigation of which it has received
notice.

6.15 _TAP Plan_.

(a) The Company shall distribute the Rights (as defined in the TAP Plan) as
soon as practicable after the Record Time (as defined in the TAP Plan).

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms,

enter into or adopt any "poison pill" or similar stockholder rights plan.

 



54 (c) The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed of the occurrence of any
Stock Acquisition Date (as defined in the TAP Plan). Notwithstanding the
first paragraph of Section 3.1(c) of the TAP Plan, in the event a Flip-in Date

Parents option, the Board of Directors of the Company shall exchange, as
soon as practicable after the Flip-in Date, all (but not less than all) of the
then outstanding Rights for shares of Common Stock or TAP Plan Preferred Stock
(as permitted by Section 3.1(d) of the TAP Plan) at the Exchange Ratio (as

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating party or parties, and except as provided below, whether before or
after the Requisite Company Vote is obtained by the Company:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



57 (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or otherwise
making the consummation of the Merger illegal has become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose failure to
comply with any covenant in this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, such action or inaction;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that if the failure
of the Closing to occur by such date shall be primarily due to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, such party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(c)_;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company (in the case of a termination by Parent)
or Parent or Merger Sub (in the case of a termination by the Company), which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ (in the
case of a termination by Parent) or _Section 7.3_ (in the case of a
termination by the Company) and which is not cured within thirty (30) days (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date) following written
notice to the Company (in the case of a termination by Parent) or Parent (in
the case of a termination by the Company) or by its nature or timing cannot be
cured during such period;

 

(e) by the Company, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in order
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
concurrently with such termination; _provided_ , that (i) the Company shall
have complied in all material respects with _Section 6.9_ and (ii)
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent
the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_;

(f) by Parent, if, prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change;

(g) by Parent, if there shall have been a material breach of _Section 6.9_;
_provided_ , that Parent shall only have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ if it delivers to the Company a written
notice of such termination within ten (10) business days after becoming aware
of any such breach; or

(h) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Meeting (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) shall have been held and completed and
the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained at such Company
Meeting.

 



58 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective affiliates or any other Parent Related Party shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _Section 6.2(b)_, this
_Section 8.2_, _Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its fraud or its willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement occurring prior to termination.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_
or by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(f)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, then the
Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day
funds (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_,
concurrently with such termination, and in the case of a termination pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, within three (3) business days
after such termination); or

 

(ii) (A) following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been announced, publicly disclosed or
commenced or made known to the Board of Directors of the Company, (B)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(h)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_, and (C) at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior
to the expiration of the twelfth (12th) month after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal made as described in
subclause (A), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same-day funds on the earlier of the date the Company enters into
a definitive agreement providing for such Acquisition Proposal or the date
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated.

 

(c) For purposes of:

 

(i) _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.9(a)_ except that all references
to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(ii) this _Section 8.2_, the " _Termination Fee_ " means $7,250,000, in cash.

 

(d) In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Parent the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in _Section 8.2(b)_ are an
integral part of the transactions

 



59  contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement and (iii) the Termination Fee
is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that is intended to compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in
which such Termination Fee is payable. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company or any successor of the Company for the amount set forth
in _Section 8.2(b)_ or any portion thereof, the Company shall reimburse
Parent for reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by Parent and its affiliates in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ through the date of payment. If the Termination Fee is
payable and paid in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.2(b)_, in
connection with a termination otherwise in accordance with the terms of
_Section 8.1_, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available
to Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply to any loss suffered as a result of any fraud by the Company or the
Companys willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.11_.

9.12 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations contained herein shall be assigned by
any of the parties hereto

 



64  (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any of their controlled
affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that such assignment shall not (a)
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder or enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of the Company or (b) prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis. Any purported assignment
in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.6_, which
is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations
and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the
parties hereto of the risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than
the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. Accordingly, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and the Commitment Letter, or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof and thereof (including the parties obligation to
consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The parties agree that under
no circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance and any money damages. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Commitment Letter, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Parent to enforce the terms of the Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 

9.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



65 9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, as a defense to the formation of
a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

9.16 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and no Parent Related Party shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or the Commitment
Letter for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based upon, or
in respect of, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
9.16_ shall limit the rights of the Company (i) set forth in the last
sentence of _Section 9.13_ or (ii) pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.
As used in this Agreement, " _Parent Related Parties_ " means Parents non-
controlled affiliates (including the Funds), and any of Parents or its non-
controlled affiliates respective former, current or future affiliates,
general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
managers, members, controlling persons, advisors, attorneys, representatives
or agents and any heirs, executors, successors or assigns of any of the
foregoing.
