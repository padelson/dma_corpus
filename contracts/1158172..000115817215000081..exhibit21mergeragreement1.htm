THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of September 29, 2015 by and among comScore, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("comScore"), Rum Acquisition Corporation, an Oregon
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of comScore ("Merger Sub"), and
Rentrak Corporation, an Oregon corporation ("Rentrak"). All capitalized terms
used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of comScore, Merger Sub
and Rentrak have approved the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and deems it advisable and in the best interest of their respective
stockholders to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Rentrak (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
Oregon Business Corporation Act (the "OBCA"), Rentrak will continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
comScore and each share of Rentrak Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as defined herein) will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the consideration set forth herein, all upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement will be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of comScore and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Rentrak, in
their respective capacities as shareholders of Rentrak, and certain other
shareholders of Rentrak have entered into support agreements with comScore
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a "Rentrak
Support Agreement" and collectively, the "Rentrak Support Agreements").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Rentrak to enter into this
Agreement, each of the officers and directors of comScore, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of comScore, and certain other stockholders of
comScore have entered into support agreements with Rentrak, substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a "comScore Support Agreement"
and collectively, the "comScore Support Agreements").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
comScore, Merger Sub and Rentrak hereby agree as follows:

Article I 
THE MERGER

 1.1 The Merger.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the OBCA, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into Rentrak, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease and Rentrak shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of comScore. Rentrak,
as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Surviving Corporation." Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, comScore, Merger Sub and Rentrak
shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the OBCA by filing articles of
merger in customary form and substance (the "Articles of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Oregon (the "Oregon Secretary of State") in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the OBCA. The time of such filing
and acceptance by the Oregon Secretary of State, or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by comScore and Rentrak and specified in the Articles of
Merger, is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

1.2 The Surviving Corporation of the Merger.

(a) Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(i) Articles of Incorporation. Subject to the terms of Section 7.8(b), at the
Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Rentrak shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read identically to the Articles of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
amended and restated Articles of Incorporation shall become the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the OBCA and such Articles of
Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Rentrak."

(ii) Bylaws. Subject to the terms of Section 7.8(b), at the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the OBCA, the Articles
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

(b) Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(i) Directors. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(ii) Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

1.3 General Effects of the Merger.

The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the OBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Rentrak and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving

 Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Rentrak and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations.

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Capital Stock of Rentrak.

(i) Generally. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of comScore, Merger Sub, Rentrak, or the holders of any of
the following securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this Section
1.4(b), each share of Rentrak Common Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive 1.1500 shares of comScore
Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") and the cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i) (the "Common Stock Consideration")
upon the surrender of the certificate, if any, representing such share of
Rentrak Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.3(c) (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.3(e)); provided,
however, that (i) the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into comScore Common Stock or Rentrak Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
comScore Common Stock or Rentrak Common Stock having a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, no fraction of a share
of comScore Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, and in lieu
thereof, each holder of record of shares of Rentrak Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of comScore Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i) (after aggregating all fractional shares of
comScore Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder of
record) shall, upon the surrender of the certificate, if any, representing
such share of Rentrak Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.3(c)
(or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section
2.3(e)), receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction
by the Closing Average. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of
Rentrak Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Rentrak
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the shares of comScore Common Stock issuable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i), cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i) and any
dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.3(d). All shares of comScore Common Stock issued upon the surrender
for exchange of shares of Rentrak Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Section
1.4(b)(i) in lieu of a fractional share of comScore Common Stock and any
dividends or other distributions paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.3(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Rentrak Common Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Rentrak Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a certificate representing
shares of Rentrak Common Stock

 is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such
certificate shall be canceled and exchanged for the Common Stock Consideration
in accordance with this Section 1.4(b), any cash payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of a fractional share of comScore
Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d).

(ii) Owned Shares of Rentrak Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of comScore, Merger Sub, Rentrak, or the
holders of any of the following securities, each share of Rentrak Common Stock
that is owned by comScore, Merger Sub or Rentrak, or by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of comScore, Merger Sub or Rentrak, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Restricted Shares of Rentrak Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, if any shares of Rentrak Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or subject to
a repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Rentrak or under which Rentrak has any rights (the "Rentrak Restricted
Stock"), then the Common Stock Consideration payable in exchange for such
Rentrak Restricted Stock also shall be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition and
need not be paid until such time as such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition lapses or otherwise terminates, and the certificates
representing such shares of Rentrak Restricted Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends. Prior to the Effective Time, Rentrak shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, comScore is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other
right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

(c) Stock Awards of Rentrak.

(i) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Rentrak Stock Award that is a
stock option to purchase shares of Rentrak Common Stock (each a "Rentrak Stock
Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable (each, an "Assumed Option"), shall be
assumed by comScore and converted into an option to acquire that number of
shares of comScore Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of shares of Rentrak Common Stock subject to such Rentrak Stock
Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of
comScore Common Stock. Each Assumed Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were
applicable under the respective Rentrak Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that each Assumed Option shall have an exercise price
per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share
exercise price of Rentrak Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option by (y)
the Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option that
qualified as a United States-based incentive stock option (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent
permissible, following the Effective Time. For employees of Rentrak or its
Subsidiaries located outside of the U.S., to the extent required to ensure
compliance with applicable local laws, comScore may require that outstanding
options be exercised only by a cashless exercise pursuant to which employees
will authorize a broker to sell all shares that they are entitled to at
exercise immediately upon exercise and receive the difference between the
market value of the shares at exercise and the exercise price in cash.

 (ii) Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each Rentrak Restricted
Stock Unit and Rentrak Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or issuable (each, an
"Assumed Unit"), shall be assumed by comScore; provided, however, that each
Assumed Unit shall be converted into an award to receive that number of shares
of comScore Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Rentrak Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share of comScore Common Stock. Each Assumed Unit
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to
vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective Rentrak
Restricted Stock Unit or Rentrak Performance Stock Unit, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed Unit that
was granted with a purchase price other than par value shall have a purchase
price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share
purchase price of Rentrak Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent).

(iii) Registration Statements for Assumed Options and Other Awards. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Effective Time, comScore shall file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or another
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of comScore Common Stock issuable with
respect to the Assumed Options, Assumed Units and the Common Stock
Consideration payable in exchange for Rentrak Restricted Stock, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in
effect for so long as such Assumed Options or Assumed Units remain
outstanding.

1.5 Further Action.

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Rentrak and Merger Sub,
the directors and officers of Rentrak and Merger Sub shall have the authority
to take all such lawful and necessary action.

1.6 Tax Reorganization.

The parties hereto intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and that this Agreement is hereby adopted as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

(e) Exchange Fund.

 (i) Creation of Exchange Fund. As promptly as practicable (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following the Effective Time, comScore shall
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article II, the shares of comScore Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.4(b)(i) in exchange for shares of Rentrak Common Stock. In addition,
comScore shall make available from time to time after the Effective Time as
necessary, cash in an amount sufficient to pay any cash payable pursuant to
Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional shares of comScore Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Rentrak Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(d). Any comScore Common Stock
and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "Exchange Fund."

(ii) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of comScore
or the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to comScore or the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of comScore or the
Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares who have not surrendered such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
compliance with this Section 2.3 shall after such delivery to comScore and the
Surviving Corporation look only to comScore and the Surviving Corporation for
delivery or payment of the shares of comScore Common Stock issuable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), cash payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of any fractional shares of comScore
Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d).

(f) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, comScore shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Rentrak Common Stock (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated shares of Rentrak
Common Stock represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares") (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form as Rentrak and comScore may reasonably agree
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for certificates representing
whole shares of comScore Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), cash
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of any
fractional shares of comScore Common Stock and any dividends or other
distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d). With
respect to uncertificated shares of Rentrak Common Stock held through "direct
registration," comScore shall implement procedures with the Exchange Agent for
effecting the exchange of such directly registered uncertificated shares of
Rentrak Common Stock and payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits in lieu thereof)
or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by comScore, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole shares
of comScore Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or such
Book Entry Shares surrendered by such holder of record) such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) (which, at the election of
comScore, may be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested by the holder of record or is otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements), payment of any cash such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional shares of comScore
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3(d), which shares and cash comScore shall cause
the Exchange Agent to distribute as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days) following surrender of such Certificates or
Book Entry Shares and such duly

 completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose for an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book Entry
Shares on the cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or
such Book Entry Shares pursuant to this Section 2.3. Until so surrendered,
from and after the Effective Time outstanding Certificates or Book Entry
Shares shall be deemed to evidence only the ownership of the number of full
shares of comScore Common Stock into which such shares of Rentrak Common Stock
shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.4(b)(i) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.3(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Certificates and Book Entry Shares to be exchanged by any Person constituting
an "affiliate" of Rentrak for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
shall be subject to the restrictions described in such Rule 145.

(g) Dividends and Distributions. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to comScore Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a
dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of comScore Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to comScore Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares of
comScore Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such
Certificates or such Book Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificates or
such Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, following
surrender of any such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, promptly
after such surrender, the number of whole shares of comScore Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor along with any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of comScore Common Stock.

(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the shares of comScore Common
Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), the cash
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional
shares of comScore Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d); provided, however, that comScore
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such reasonable and customary amount as comScore may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against comScore, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(i) Transferred Shares. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of
Rentrak Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of Rentrak, or if shares of comScore Common Stock are to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are
registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
comScore (or any agent designated by comScore) any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of comScore Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of comScore (or any agent designated by
comScore) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable.

 (j) Tax Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, comScore and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Rentrak
Capital Stock, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non U.S. tax
law or under any applicable Legal Requirement and to request and receive from
such holder or former holder any relevant tax forms, including Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or similar information. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(k) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, comScore, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of comScore
Common Stock or Rentrak Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Legal Requirement.

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Rentrak Material
Adverse Effect.

3.2 Authority; Approvals and Enforceability.

(l) Rentrak has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and

Rentrak, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by comScore
and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Rentrak, enforceable against Rentrak in accordance with its terms, except

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Legal Requirements affecting
creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of
equitable remedies.

redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Rentrak or any of
its Subsidiaries or to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of
a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any other
entity. Except as set forth in Section 3.5(d) of the Rentrak Disclosure
Letter, there here are no registration rights or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which Rentrak or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, or by which it or they are bound, obligating Rentrak or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any shares of Rentrak Common Stock or shares of
capital stock of any such Subsidiary.

(e) All outstanding shares of Rentrak Common Stock are, and all shares of
Rentrak Common Stock reserved for issuance as specified above will be, upon

of each Subsidiary's outstanding capital stock owned by Rentrak or another
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Rentrak, is set forth in Section 3.6 of the Rentrak

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Legal
Requirements of its jurisdiction of organization (to the extent such concepts
exist in such jurisdictions) and has all requisite corporate or other power
and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease and operate the properties
it purports to own, lease or operate and to conduct its business as it is
currently conducted, except to the extent that the failure to be so organized

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Rentrak
Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Rentrak is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction (to the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions)
where the character or location of the properties owned, leased or operated by
it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or
licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Rentrak Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 SEC Reports.

Rentrak has filed and made available to comScore (including via the SEC's
EDGAR system) all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents,
including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by Rentrak with the SEC

if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then
on the date of such filing), and in the case of such forms, reports and
documents filed by Rentrak with the SEC after the date of this Agreement, will
not as of the time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Rentrak

impairment or restriction of any right or license granted to Rentrak or any of
its Subsidiaries under a Rentrak IP License, or (iii) Rentrak or any of its

characterized as a "parachute payment," within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
to which Rentrak or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party or by which it is
bound to compensate any current or former employee or other disqualified
individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

party, including the provisions of this Agreement, covering any employee,
consultant or director of Rentrak or any of its Subsidiaries, which,
individually or collectively, reasonably could be expected to give rise to the
payment of any material amount that would not be deductible pursuant to
Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code.

injunction or claim is pending, or to the knowledge of comScore, threatened,

furnish non-public information to, such Person pursuant to this Section 6.3;

(v) prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or negotiations
with, or initially furnishing any non-public information to, such Person after
the date hereof, the party proposing to take such action enters into a written
confidentiality agreement, each of the terms of which are no less favorable to
such party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided,
however, that no such confidentiality agreement need include "standstill"
provisions); and

(vi) promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) after furnishing any non-
public information to such Person, the party hereto proposing to take such
action furnishes such non-public information to the other party hereto (to the
extent such information has not been previously furnished to such other
party).

6.4 Responsibility for Actions of Representatives.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Rentrak and comScore
acknowledge and hereby agree that any breach or violation of the restrictions
set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 by any Representative retained by
either of them (or any Representative of any such Representatives) shall be
deemed to be a breach of Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, as applicable, by such
party.

6.5 Notification Requirements.

(h) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3, each of Rentrak
and comScore shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty four (24) hours of

and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal it receives (either directly or
through any of its Representatives), (ii) any request for information it
receives (either directly or through any of its Representatives) that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition

Acquisition Transaction, request or inquiry (including copies of all written
materials comprising or relating thereto), and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

 (i) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.5(a), each of
Rentrak and comScore shall keep the other party hereto reasonably informed on
a prompt basis of the status of any discussions and negotiations with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction and the material terms
and conditions thereof (including all amendments or proposed amendments),
request or inquiry either of them receives (either directly or through any of
its Representatives). In addition to the foregoing, each of Rentrak and
comScore shall provide the other party hereto with prompt (and in any event at
least twenty-four (24) hours) notice of a meeting of its board of directors
(or any committee thereof) at which its board of directors (or any committee
thereof) is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or

delivery of this Agreement, each of comScore and Rentrak shall file with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby as required by the HSR Act, and each of comScore and/or Rentrak shall

hereto an opportunity to attend or participate in such meeting or discussion,
and (iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondences, filings,
and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that (i) any materials concerning valuation of the transaction or
internal financial information may be redacted, and (ii) each of comScore and
Rentrak may, as each deem advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 7.2
as "counsel only" and, in such event, such material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and shall not be disclosed by such counsel to non-legal directors,
officers, employees or other advisors or representatives of the recipient
unless prior consent is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
or its legal counsel.

(k) If either comScore or Rentrak or either of their respective Affiliates
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any other

contained in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Legal
Requirement or Order, or if any Legal Requirement or Order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make
illegal, or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay, the Merger

Rentrak shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest such action or proceeding and have vacated
or otherwise lifted any such Legal Requirement or Order, including by
effecting or committing to, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of comScore and Rentrak or their respective Subsidiaries,
and (ii) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the ability of
comScore and Rentrak or their respective Subsidiaries to freely conduct their
business or own such assets, provided however that nothing in this Section
7.2(d) requires comScore or Rentrak to agree to or effectuate any sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate of any assets or
categories of assets if such an action would materially affect comScore's or
Rentrak's respective business. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, Rentrak shall not, without comScore's prior
written consent, and comScore and Merger Sub shall not, without Rentrak's
prior written consent, (i) commit to any material sale, divestiture, license
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust

7.3 Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(a) As promptly as practicable (but in any event no more than forty-five (45)
days) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, comScore and Rentrak
shall prepare, and comScore shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares of comScore Common Stock
in the Merger (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement shall include (i) a
prospectus for the issuance of shares of comScore Common Stock in the Merger
(including shares of comScore Common Stock issued in the Merger in exchange
for shares of Rentrak Restricted Stock), (ii) a proxy statement of comScore
for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the comScore Voting
Proposal to be considered at the comScore Stockholder Meeting, and (iii) a
proxy statement of Rentrak for use in connection with the solicitation of
proxies for the Rentrak Voting Proposal to be considered at the Rentrak
Shareholder Meeting (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of comScore and Rentrak shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing with the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Rentrak and comScore shall, and shall cause its respective
representatives to, fully cooperate with the other party hereto and its
respective Representatives in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party
hereto with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other
party hereto may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto, and each of
comScore and Rentrak shall provide the other party hereto with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. As promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, comScore and
Rentrak shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their
respective stockholders.

 (b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the
approval of comScore and Rentrak, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that comScore, in
connection with a comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change, and
Rentrak, in connection with a Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation
Change, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a
Qualifying Amendment to effect such change, and in such event, the right of
approval set forth in this Section 7.3(b) shall apply only with respect to
such information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each
party to have its board of directors' deliberations and conclusions be
accurately described therein.

(c) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply
in all material respects as to form and substance with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or
declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not,
on the date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, at the time of each of
the Merger Stockholder Meetings, or as of the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. In addition, the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165
and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a‑12 under the Exchange Act
(each, a "Regulation M‑A Filing") shall not, at the time any such Regulation
M‑A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time Rentrak and comScore shall notify each other as promptly as practicable
upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be described in
an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement, Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document
would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements or the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders
of Rentrak and/or comScore. Rentrak and comScore shall each notify the other
as promptly as practicable after the receipt by such party of any written or
oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing,
and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
it or any of its representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any
of the foregoing filings.

(e) comScore and Rentrak shall make any necessary filings with respect to the
Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 (i) If Rentrak determines it is required to file any document other than the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in connection with the Merger
pursuant to applicable law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an
"Other Required Rentrak Filing"), then Rentrak shall promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Rentrak Filing with the SEC. Rentrak shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any Other Required Rentrak Filing to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market. Rentrak
will promptly notify comScore of, and cooperate with comScore with respect to,
any Other Required Rentrak Filing Rentrak intends to file with the SEC. On the
date of filing, the date of mailing to Rentrak Stockholders (if applicable)
and at the time of Rentrak Stockholder Meeting, any Other Required Rentrak
Filing will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant
is made by Rentrak with respect to any information supplied by comScore,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Rentrak Filing. The information supplied by
comScore and its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any
Other Required Rentrak Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required
Rentrak Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(ii) If comScore, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is/are
required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Merger or
Rentrak Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable law (an "Other Required
comScore Filing"), then comScore and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other Required
comScore Filing with the SEC. comScore and Merger Sub shall cause, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required comScore Filing
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
comScore and Merger Sub will promptly notify Rentrak of, and cooperate with
Rentrak with respect to, any Other Required comScore Filing comScore or Merger
Sub intends to file with the SEC. On the date of filing, the date of mailing
to Rentrak Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of Rentrak Stockholder
Meeting, no Other Required comScore Filing will knowingly contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by comScore or Merger Sub
with respect to any information supplied by Rentrak or any of its Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required comScore
Filing. The information supplied by Rentrak, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Other Required comScore Filing will not, at the
time that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or such Other Required comScore
Filing is filed with the SEC, knowingly contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(f) comScore shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required
under any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in
connection with the issuance of shares of comScore Common Stock in the Merger.

7.4 Stockholder Meetings and Board Recommendations.

(j) Each of Rentrak and comScore, acting through its board of directors, shall
take all actions in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, applicable
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market,

 the Rentrak Articles of Incorporation and the Rentrak Bylaws in the case of
Rentrak, and the comScore Certificate of Incorporation and the comScore Bylaws
in the case of comScore, to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after
the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, a meeting of
its stockholders (including any postponement or adjournment thereof, the
"Rentrak Shareholder Meeting" in the case of Rentrak, and the "comScore
Stockholder Meeting" in the case of comScore, and together, the "Merger
Stockholder Meetings") for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
approval of the Rentrak Voting Proposal in the case of Rentrak and the
comScore Voting Proposal in the case of comScore. Each of Rentrak and comScore
shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Rentrak Voting
Proposal in the case of Rentrak and the comScore Voting Proposal in the case
of comScore, and unless the board of directors of either party hereto shall
effect a Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change in the case of
Rentrak or a comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change in the case of
comScore, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.4(f), use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Rentrak Shareholder
Approval in the case of Rentrak and the Requisite comScore Stockholder
Approval in the case of comScore. Each of Rentrak and comScore shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
with its Merger Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with the OBCA
or DGCL, as applicable, the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Rentrak
Articles of Incorporation and the Rentrak Bylaws in the case of Rentrak, and
the comScore Certificate of Incorporation and the comScore Bylaws in the case
of comScore, and all other applicable Legal Requirements.

(k) Each of Rentrak and comScore shall use its reasonable best efforts to
call, give notice of, convene and hold their respective Merger Stockholder
Meetings on the same day and at the same time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of Rentrak or comScore, after
consultation with the other party hereto, may (but shall not be required to)
adjourn or postpone its respective Merger Stockholder Meeting if (and solely
to the extent and for the minimum duration reasonably necessary to ensure
that) (i) any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to its respective stockholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of its respective Merger Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the applicable Merger Stockholder
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Rentrak Common Stock
in the case of Rentrak, or comScore Common Stock in the case of comScore,
represented (either in person or by proxy) at the respective Merger
Stockholder meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the respective Merger Stockholder Meeting, or (iii) the other party hereto
has adjourned or postponed its Merger Stockholder Meeting for any of the
foregoing reasons.

(l) Following the Merger Stockholder Meetings and at or prior to the Closing,
each of Rentrak and comScore shall deliver to the corporate secretary of the
other party hereto a certificate setting forth the voting results from the
respective Merger Stockholder Meeting.

(m) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Rentrak shall submit the Rentrak
Voting Proposal to the Rentrak Shareholders at the Rentrak Shareholders
Meeting for the purpose of acting upon such proposal, and comScore shall
submit the comScore Voting Proposal to the comScore Stockholders at the
comScore Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of acting upon such proposal, in
each case whether or not (i) the Rentrak board of directors of directors or
the comScore board of directors of directors, as the case may be, at any time
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Merger Stockholder
Meetings shall effect a Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change in
the case of Rentrak or a comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change in
the case of comScore, or (ii) any actual, potential or purported Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Proposal has been commenced, disclosed, announced or
submitted to the Rentrak board of directors of directors in the case of
Rentrak or the comScore board of directors of directors in the case of
comScore.

 (n) Subject to the terms of Section 7.4(f), (i) the Rentrak board of directors
shall recommend that the Rentrak Shareholders adopt the Rentrak Voting
Proposal at the Rentrak Shareholder Meeting in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the OBCA (the "Rentrak board of directors Recommendation"), and
(ii) the comScore board of directors shall recommend that the comScore
Stockholders approve the comScore Voting Proposal at the comScore Stockholder
Meeting in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and
applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the "comScore board of directors
Recommendation").

(o) Subject to the terms of this Section 7.4(f), (x) neither the Rentrak board
of directors nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, qualify or condition, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend, modify, qualify or condition, the Rentrak board of directors
Recommendation (an "Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change"), and
(y) neither the comScore board of directors nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify or condition, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify or condition, the comScore board
of directors Recommendation (a "comScore Board of Directors Recommendation
Change"); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Requisite Rentrak Shareholder Approval in the case
of Rentrak, or receipt of the Requisite comScore Stockholder Approval in the
case of comScore, the Rentrak board of directors may effect a Rentrak Board of
Directors Recommendation Change and, in the case of subclause (i) below,
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to a Superior
Proposal, and the comScore board of directors may effect a comScore Board of
Directors Recommendation Change and, in the case of subclause (i) below,
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to a Superior
Proposal, and, in either case if and only if either:

(v) (A) the party proposing to take such action has received after the date
hereof an Acquisition Proposal relating to such party that its board of
directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
and legal advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such Acquisition
Proposal did not result from or arise out of a breach of any provisions of
Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, and the Person from whom such party received such
Acquisition Proposal has not made any other Acquisition Proposal (either alone
or together with one or more other Persons) that resulted from or arose out of
a breach of any provisions of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, (C) the party
proposing to take such action has not breached any of the provisions of
Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 in respect of such Acquisition Proposal (and any
other Acquisition Proposal made by the same Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, whether alone or together with one or more other Persons), (D) prior
to effecting such Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change or the
comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the
party proposing to take such action shall have given the other party hereto at
least three (3) Business Days' notice thereof (which notice shall not, by
itself, constitute a Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change or a
comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet
and discuss in good faith potential amendments or other modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be effected, (E) the other
party hereto shall not have made, within the foregoing three (3) Business Days
after receipt of such party's written notice of its intention to effect a
Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change or a comScore Board of
Directors Recommendation Change, as the case may be, a counteroffer or
proposal that the board of directors of the party proposing to take such
action determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel) is at least
as favorable to its stockholders as such Superior Proposal, and (F) after such
discussions, the board of directors of the party proposing to take such action
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and after considering in good faith any counteroffer or proposal made by the
other party hereto pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (E)) that the
failure to effect such Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation

 Change or a comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change, as the case may
be, would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law or Oregon Law, as applicable; or

(vi) in response to an Intervening Event, if: (A) prior to effecting the
Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change or the comScore Board of
Directors Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the party proposing to
take such action shall have given the other party hereto at least three (3)
Business Days' notice thereof (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a
Rentrak Board of Directors Recommendation Change or a comScore Board of
Directors Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and discuss in
good faith the purported basis for the proposed the Rentrak Board of Directors
Recommendation Change or the comScore Board of Directors Recommendation
Change, as the case may be, the other party's reaction thereto and potential
amendments and modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for
the purpose of obviating the need for the Rentrak board of directors or
comScore board of directors, as the case may be, to effect a Rentrak Board of
Directors Recommendation Change or a comScore Board of Directors
Recommendation Change, as applicable, as a result of such Intervening Event,
and (B) after such discussions, the board of directors of the party proposing
to take such action determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to effect such Rentrak Board of Directors
Recommendation Change or comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change, as
the case may be, would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties under Delaware Law or Oregon Law, as applicable.

(p) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Rentrak board of directors or
the comScore board of directors from taking and disclosing to the Rentrak
Shareholders or the comScore Stockholders, respectively, a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that (i) any statements made by Rentrak (with respect to statements
made by the Rentrak board of directors) and any statements made by comScore
(with respect to statements made by the comScore board of directors) pursuant
to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) any
statements or disclosures regarding this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or about any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal) or Acquisition Transaction (other than a
"stop, look and listen communication" of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within the time period contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to constitute a Rentrak Board of Directors
Recommendation Change or a comScore Board of Directors Recommendation Change,
as the case may be, unless such statement or disclosure is accompanied by an
express, unequivocal affirmation of the Rentrak board of directors
Recommendation or the comScore board of directors Recommendation, as
applicable (it being understood that any statement or disclosure that a party
is re-affirming its board recommendation because it is required or compelled
to do so as a result of the terms of this Agreement (or the consequences of
not doing so hereunder) shall be deemed to be a Rentrak Board of Directors

7.7 Employee Plans.

As of the Effective Time, and for a period of at least twelve (12) months
thereafter (or until termination of employment, if earlier), comScore shall
provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to provide, each individual who was an employee of
Rentrak or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who is an employee of comScore or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) as of the Effective Time
(each an "Rentrak Employee") with a base salary or wage rate that is not less
than that provided to such employee by Rentrak and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(a) Rentrak ESPP. Prior to the Closing, (i) Rentrak shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that (a) all outstanding purchase rights under the
Rentrak ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of
the Rentrak ESPP, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the
Rentrak ESPP shall terminate with such purchase and no further purchase rights
are granted under the Rentrak ESPP thereafter.

(b) Rentrak Group Plans; 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, Rentrak and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable,
shall terminate (i) any and all group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements, and (ii) any and all plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless comScore
provides written notice to Rentrak that such 401(k) plans shall not be
terminated) (collectively, the "Rentrak Terminating Plans"). Unless comScore
provides such written notice to Rentrak, no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Rentrak shall provide comScore with evidence that
such RentrakTerminating Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of Rentrak's
Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of comScore, which approval shall not be
unreasonably denied. Rentrak also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Rentrak Terminating Plan(s) as comScore may reasonably
require.

(c) Pre-Existing Conditions; Service Credit; Etc. From and after the Effective
Time, and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, comScore
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, recognize the prior service with Rentrak or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of each Rentrak Employee in connection with all
employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation and
severance, but excluding the sabbatical program) of comScore or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) in which
Rentrak Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of level of benefits
(but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in
duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time, comScore shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such

 waiting periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with
Rentrak), actively-at-work requirements and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans of comScore or its affiliates to be
waived with respect to Rentrak Employees and their eligible spouses, domestic
partners and dependents, and (ii) provide each Rentrak Employee (and his or
her spouse, domestic partner and dependents) with credit for any deductibles
paid under any Rentrak Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or vision
benefits in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under any medical, dental
or vision plans of comScore or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) that such employees are (or their
spouses, domestic partners or dependents) eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the
comparable Rentrak Employee Plan. The provisions of this Section 7.7(d) are
not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, and the parties hereby expressly disclaim the
creation or establishment of any third party beneficiary rights (whether
express or implied) under or by right of the terms of this Section 7.7(c).
Nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee Benefit Plan to reflect
the terms of this Section 7.7(c).

(d) Severance. Prior to the Closing, each of comScore and Rentrak shall adopt
and implement severance plans and arrangements reflecting the terms set forth
in Schedule 7.7(d) hereto, each of which shall be subject to review and
approval of the other party hereto.

7.8 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and comScore shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of Rentrak and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
between Rentrak or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current
or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or
officer of Rentrak or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and
comScore shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause
their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as
favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
provisions contained in the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of Rentrak and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any respect except as
and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and comScore shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the existing policy of Rentrak's directors' and officers'
liability insurance (the "DandO Policy") covering claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent
that such acts or omissions are covered by the DandO Policy) and covering each
Indemnified Party who is covered as of the Effective Time by the DandO Policy on
terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than
those terms in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event
shall comScore or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by Rentrak
(which annual premium is set forth on Section 7.8(b) of the Rentrak Disclosure
Letter) for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"),
provided that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain, and comScore
shall cause and financially

 enable the Surviving Corporation to obtain, a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under this Section 7.8(b), comScore or
Rentrak may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Policy on
terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Policy, and in the
event that comScore shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and comScore shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder in lieu of all other
obligations of comScore and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
7.8(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

(c) The obligations under this Section 7.8 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the
"tail" policy referred to in Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or
the "tail" policy referred to in Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section
7.8(b) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 7.8
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by Rentrak or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law or in equity).

(d) In the event that comScore, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other person,
then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable),
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.8.

7.9 Listing of comScore Shares.

comScore shall use its reasonable best efforts to have authorized for listing
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market prior to the Effective Time, upon official
notice of issuance, the shares of comScore Common Stock issuable in the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement, and the shares of comScore Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of all Assumed Options and the shares of comScore Common
Stock issuable in respect of all Assumed Units.

7.10 Takeover Statutes.

If any "business combination," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or similar takeover law (collectively, "Takeover Laws") is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Rentrak Support Agreements, the
comScore Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Rentrak and comScore and their respective boards
of directors shall take all lawful actions necessary to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or

 minimize the effect of such Takeover Laws on this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

7.11 Section 16 Matters.

The comScore board of directors of directors, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b‑3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the receipt by Rentrak Insiders of comScore
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Rentrak Common Stock, and of options to
purchase comScore Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of the Rentrak
Stock Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, is
intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b‑3 under the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Rentrak board of directors, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b‑3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective
Time providing that the disposition by Rentrak Insiders of Rentrak Common
Stock in exchange for shares of comScore Common Stock, and the disposition of
their Rentrak Stock Awards which will be deemed to occur upon the assumption
of those options and their resulting conversion into options to purchase
comScore Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b‑3 under the
Exchange Act.

7.12 Tax Matters.

(a) None of comScore, Merger Sub or Rentrak shall, and they shall not permit
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to or following
the Effective Time that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

(b) Each of comScore and Rentrak shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in Section 2.2(a)(vii) (collectively, the
"Tax Opinions"). Officers of comScore, Merger Sub and Rentrak shall execute
and deliver to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation,
counsel to comScore, and Perkins Coie LLP, counsel to Rentrak, certificates
containing customary representations at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by such law firms, including the effective date of the

deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger.

parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches

No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive

party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the actions of
comScore, Merger Sub or Rentrak in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware (except that the
provisions of the laws of the State of Oregon shall apply with respect to the
effectiveness of the merger, fiduciary duties and any provisions set forth
herein that are required to be governed by such laws or where such laws are
otherwise mandatorily applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby).

accept or does not have jurisdiction) in connection with any matter based upon
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the
laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to
assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such
