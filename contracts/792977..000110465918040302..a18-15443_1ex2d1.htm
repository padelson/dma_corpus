corporation (the " _Company_ "), GI Chill Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Purchaser_ "), and AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a

otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article XII_.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Seller is the owner of 1,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Shares represent all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to
which the Seller shall sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase
from the Seller, all of the Shares (the " _Purchased Shares_ ") on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, the Person listed on the _Non-Competition Agreement Schedule_ is
entering into a non-competition, non-solicitation, non-hire and

_Exhibit C_ (the " _Non-Competition Agreement_ "), which such Non-Competition
Agreement shall become effective upon the Closing.

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, the Person listed on the _Employment Agreement Amendment Schedule_
is entering into an employment agreement amendment with the Company in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Employment Agreement Amendment_
"), which such Employment Agreement Amendment shall become effective upon the
Closing.

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Seller to enter into this
Agreement, GI Partners Fund V LP, a Delaware limited partnership, GI Partners
Fund V-A LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and GI Partners Executive Fund V
LP, a Delaware limited partnership (collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") are

E_ (the " _Guarantee_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, the Seller and the Company are entering into the Transition
Services Agreement with Purchaser, which such Transition Services Agreement
shall become effective upon the Closing.

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Seller to enter into this
Agreement, Purchaser has bound and delivered the RandW Insurance Policy.

      
 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES_

 



 

1.01 _Sale and Purchase of Purchased Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign,
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing, and the Purchaser agrees
that it shall purchase and accept delivery from the Seller of, all of the
Purchased Shares, which shall constitute all of the outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company, free and
clear of all Liens other than applicable federal and state securities law
restrictions.

 



 

1.02 _Consideration_. As consideration for the Purchased Shares, the Purchaser
shall (a) deliver to the Seller, in the manner and as adjusted as described
herein, an amount equal to the Closing Cash Consideration and (b) deliver to
the Escrow Agent, in the manner described herein, an amount equal to the
Escrow Deposit.

 



 

1.03 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a
schedule (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith
estimates of (i) Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (" _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), and (iv) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount_ "), together with a schedule calculating in reasonable detail
such amounts (and, for the avoidance of doubt, including an updated version of
_Schedule 8.09_ updated to be as of the Closing). The Estimated Closing
Statement shall also include each of (A) the Payoff Letters, (B) the Closing
Indebtedness Schedule, (C) the invoices from the respective payees
representing Transaction Expenses with respect to items described in clause
(ii) of the definition of Transaction Expenses, and (D) the Transaction
Expenses Schedule.

 



 

1.04 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will deliver to the Seller a statement showing the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary
Statement_ "). The calculations of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses
and Net Working Capital shall be determined (including for purposes of
_Section 1.03_) on a consolidated basis (of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and not on a consolidated basis of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) in
accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the calculation of
Net Working Capital set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, to the extent not specified
on _Exhibit A_, in accordance with GAAP, and shall not include any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments (related
to the transactions contemplated hereby) or other changes arising from or
resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.02_). The parties agree that the
purpose of determining Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net
Working Capital and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this
_Section 1.04 _is to (i) measure the amount of

 



      
 

 



 

Cash, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (ii) measure changes in Net
Working Capital against the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments,
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of determining
Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital. After
delivery of the Preliminary Statement, upon reasonable request and reasonable
notice from the Seller, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide the
Seller and its accountants and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and
records and work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary
Statement. The Seller and its accountants and other representatives may make
inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company and their respective accountants
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Preliminary Statement
arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use
its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to reasonably
cooperate with and respond to such reasonably requested inquiries. If the
Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth in reasonable detail each
objected item or amount and the basis for such objection, together with
supporting calculations (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days after
delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the Seller, the Preliminary Statement
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. Any items or
calculations set forth in the Preliminary Statement and not specifically
objected to in an Objections Statement delivered to Purchaser within sixty
(60) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to Seller, shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
submit such dispute to Grant Thornton LLP (or if Grant Thornton LLP is
unwilling or unable to accept such engagement, such other accounting firm as
is mutually agreed upon in writing by the Purchaser and the Seller) (Grant
Thornton LLP or such other firm mutually agreed upon, the " _Dispute Advisory
Firm_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute Advisory Firm must be written
and delivered to each party to the dispute. To the extent such amounts are in
dispute, the Dispute Advisory Firm shall make a final determination of Cash,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital, and the resulting
Final Cash Consideration calculated with reference to such amounts, in each
case in accordance with the definitions, guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement. The parties will cooperate with the Dispute Advisory Firm
during the term of its engagement. The Dispute Advisory Firm shall only have

4.06 _Financial Statements_ _._

 



 

(a) The _Financial Statements Schedule_ consists of (i) the Companys pro
forma unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and the
related statements of income and cash flow for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2016 (collectively, the " _2016 Financials_ "), (ii) the
Companys pro forma unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2017 (such balance sheet, the " _Latest Balance Sheet,_ " and such date, the "
_Latest Balance Sheet Date_ ") and the related statements of income and cash
flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 (collectively, the " _2017
Financials_ "), and (iii) the Companys pro forma unaudited consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 and the related statements of income for
the three months ended March 31, 2018 (collectively, the " _2018 Interim
Financials_ " and together with the 2016 Financials and the 2017 Financials,
the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements were prepared in
good faith and fairly present in all material respects the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis as of such respective times and for such respective time
periods referred to therein. The Seller does not maintain separate financial
statements of the Company, but the Seller does maintain separate general
ledger trial balances which, on an annual basis, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP

 



      
 

 



 

(subject to the qualifications set forth in the fifth sentence of this
_Section 4.06(a)_) and which form the basis of the Financial Statements. In
certain operational areas, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
dependent upon centralized functional activities of the Seller. The Financial
Statements are not presented on a carve-out basis and will differ materially
from the GAAP-basis Audited Financial Statements that will be delivered prior
to Closing pursuant to _Section 7.07_, in that they do not include all year-
end adjustments, audit adjustments, carve-out adjustments, or footnote
disclosures and other presentation items required to present the Financial
Statements in conformity with GAAP. The Financial Statements are derived from
the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and represent only
actual, bona fide transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are maintained by the Seller,
whose consolidated year-end financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP in all material respects.

 



 

(b) The Company, together with Seller and Sellers employees has implemented
and maintains a system of internal accounting controls which is sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no
communications of the auditors of the Company covering the periods reflected
in the Financial Statements with regard to material unresolved issues in the
Financial Statements.

 



 

(c) All accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including all
accounts receivable reflected in the Latest Balance Sheet and all accounts
receivable that have arisen since the Latest Balance Sheet Date (except such
accounts receivable as have been collected since such dates)) are valid and
enforceable claims and were earned by performance of actual, bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such accounts receivable are subject to
no valid defense, offset or counterclaim, except to the extent incorporated in
the accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which have been previously made available to the Purchaser and
except as would not adversely affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
any material respect. The allowance for doubtful accounts, if any, set forth
on the Latest Balance Sheet was determined in accordance with GAAP consistent
with past practices. All accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries
arose in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
represent only actual, bona fide transactions. Since December 31, 2016, all
current assets and current liabilities have been managed by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices (including the collection of accounts receivable and payment of
accounts payable and other liabilities).

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding
liabilities or obligations, other than liabilities and obligations (i)
included or disclosed in the Financial Statements, (ii) incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the Financial Statements (and
which do not involve breaches of contract, torts or violations of any Law),
(iii) to be included in the computation of Indebtedness,

 



      
 

 



 

Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital, (iv) disclosed on subsection (d)
of the _Financial Statements Schedule_ , or (v) that are not in excess of
$500,000 in the aggregate.

 



 

(e) The audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the related statements of income and cash
flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 (collectively, the " _2016
Audited Financial Statements_ "), and the audited consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2017 of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the related
statements of income and cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31,
2017 (collectively, the " _2017 Audited Financial Statements_ " and, together
with the 2016 Audited Financial Statements, collectively, the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ "), when delivered to Purchaser and as of the Closing
Date, have been prepared in accordance in all material respects with GAAP,
consistently applied, have been derived from and are in agreement in all
material respects with the books and accounting records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and represent only actual, bona fide transactions, and present
fairly in all material respects the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) as of the
times and for the periods referred to therein. Notwithstanding the
introductory language set forth above in this _Article IV_, the
representations and warranties set forth in this _Section 4.06(e)_ are being
made by the Company as of the date on which the Audited Financial Statements
are delivered to Purchaser and as of the Closing Date.

leasehold interest under each such lease, except as enforceability may be

deficiencies; and (F) Seller has provided to Purchaser true and correct copies
of all surveys, including without limitation, ALTA surveys, boundary surveys,
and as-built surveys, property inspection or engineering reports, and all
title commitments and title policies that have been created in the past ten

condition to the funding of the Financings on the Closing Date or result in
any portion of the Financings being unavailable on the Closing Date and,

accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and

contemplated under this Agreement and the Commitment Letters, in each case for
which the Purchaser is responsible. Except as expressly provided in the

contingencies, in each case, that are related to the funding of the full

conditions to the funding of Financings, other than as described in the
Commitment Letters (or in the unredacted portion of the fee letter delivered
hereunder).

 



 

6.09 _Solvency_. Assuming all of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article IV_ are accurate in all material respects, immediately after
giving effect to the Closing (and any transactions related thereto or incurred

exceed the fair value of the present assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

accurate in all material respects, immediately after giving effect to the
Closing (and any transactions related thereto or incurred in connection
therewith), the present fair saleable value of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not less than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their debts as they
generally become absolute and matured. Assuming all of the representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ are accurate in all material respects, immediately
after giving effect to the Closing (and any transactions related thereto or
incurred in connection therewith), the capital of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, contemplated
as of the date hereof. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the transactions

avoidance of doubt, the Company and Seller shall disclose to Purchaser that
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or indication of interest has been

relating to the Debt Financing.

disclosure or information has been withheld. The Purchaser

reasonable and documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable legal and accounting fees) incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section 7.06_ or otherwise in connection with the Debt Financing (or, in the
event that any expenses incurred prior to the opening of business on the
Closing Date are not reimbursed by the Purchaser to the Company prior to the
opening of business on the Closing Date, then, to the extent such expenses
were paid in cash by the Company or Seller prior to the opening of business on
the Closing Date, such expense reimbursement shall be made to the Seller) and
(ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents from and

Company Used Seller Agreements_ "). Agreements that fall within the definition
of Company Used Seller Agreements that are not Listed Company Used Seller
Agreements and either (i) involve at least $100,000 in annual payments or (ii)
the loss of which would be reasonably likely to cause material disruption to
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and, in each case, concerning which
Purchaser notifies Seller within six months following the Closing that it
desires to have included as Company Used Seller Agreements are referred to
herein as the " _Unlisted_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Company Used Seller Agreements_." The Listed Company Used Seller Agreements,
together with the Unlisted Company Used Seller Agreements, are referred to
herein as the " _Protected Company Used Agreements_."

 



 

(ii) " _Seller Mutual Agreements_ " means agreements in the name of the Seller
under which both the Seller and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries use, are

excluding agreements covering services which the Seller will provide to the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.
Attached hereto as the _Listed Mutual Agreement Schedule_ is a list provided
by the Seller of the Seller Mutual Agreements (the " _Listed Mutual
Agreements_ "). Agreements that fall within the definition of Seller Mutual
Agreements that are not Listed Mutual Agreements the loss of which would be
reasonably likely to cause material disruption to the Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries and, in each case, concerning which Purchaser notifies Seller
within six months following the Closing that it desires to have included as
Seller Mutual Agreements are referred to herein as the " _Unlisted Mutual
Agreements_." The Listed Mutual Agreements, together with the Unlisted Mutual
Agreements, are referred to herein as the " _Protected Mutual Agreements_."

 



 

(iii) " _Seller Referenced Company Agreements_ " means agreements in the name
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries which reference the Seller but under
which only the Company and/or its Subsidiaries use, are provided access to,
receive, or acquire products and/or services.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 7.09(c)_, _Section 7.09(d)_ or _Section
7.09(e_) below, prior to the Closing, except for this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, the Company shall cause all liabilities, obligations and
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Seller and its Subsidiaries and/or any of Sellers or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) officers, directors
or employees (or any such officers, directors or employees immediate
family), on the other hand, to be terminated in full and of no further force
or effect upon the Closing and shall cause reasonable evidence of such
termination of such liabilities, obligations and agreements to be delivered to
Purchaser.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Seller Referenced Company Agreements, prior to the
Closing Seller shall be entitled to provide written notice to the applicable
counterparty (which such form of notice shall be provided to Purchaser for its
review and prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld) (each a "
_Seller Notice"_ ) that Seller will no longer be involved with such agreement
after the Closing. Following the Closing, the Company shall indemnify Seller
for any Losses that the Seller suffers as a result of such Seller Referenced
Company Agreements; provided, however, following the Closing Seller shall
indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries from up to thirty (30) months of
any Losses that the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries suffers as a result
of, (i) if applicable, the use, access to, receipt, or acquisition of products
and/or services by the Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) pursuant to the Seller Referenced Company
Agreements, (ii) any termination of such Seller Referenced Company Agreement
(excluding any non-renewals of such Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Referenced Company Agreement) that is initiated within six (6) months after
the delivery of such Seller Notice that is primarily the result of the
delivery of such Seller Notice and/or (iii) increases of price that are
initiated within six (6) months after the delivery of such Seller Notice that
primarily result from the Seller Notice (excluding any price increases in
connection with renewals or amendments to such Seller Referenced Company
Agreement and any price increases pursuant to the terms of such Seller
Referenced Company Agreement).

 



 

(d) With respect to any Protected Mutual Agreements prior to the Closing (and
continuing thereafter for a period of six (6) months if not obtained at the
Closing), Seller, Purchaser and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts (all at Purchasers sole expense) to have the counterparty
to each Protected Mutual Agreement either (i) split its Protected Mutual
Agreement into separate agreements for the Seller and for the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries (each such separate agreement for the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries, a " _Split Agreement_ ") or (ii) put in place a new
agreement for the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (each such new agreement for
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and each Split Agreement shall each
be referred to herein as a " _Separate Agreement"_ ). The parties agree that
Seller shall not be required to negotiate on behalf of the Purchaser or the
Company with respect to any Separate Agreement, other than to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to result in a Separate Agreement or Split
Agreement being executed, and need not provide any guarantees (whether of
payment or performance), deposits, security, or similar actions or obligations
in order to procure a Separate Agreement or Split Agreement for any Party or
to obtain any particular term in any Separate Agreement or Split Agreement for
any Party.

 



 

(e) To the extent assignable, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to assign each of the Company Used Seller Agreements to the Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries at the Closing and provide the counterparty to each such
Company Used Seller Agreement written notice (subject to Purchasers prior
written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld) of such assignment. To the
extent a Company Used Seller Agreement requires consent of a counterparty
thereto, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
consent so that it can assign such Company Used Seller Agreement to the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries at Closing or, if not obtainable by the
Closing, following the Closing. To the extent a counterparty requires a fee or
other payment in order to provide such consent, such amounts shall be paid by

of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) use, access
to, receipt, or acquisition of products and/or services covered by the Company
Used Seller Agreements.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 7.09_

sufficient), (b) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries, and (c) nothing herein shall require
Seller or its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or to disclose any
information to, Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or its authorized representatives
if such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to (x) waive any

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER_

 



 

8.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, for a period
of seven years, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide
the Seller and its authorized representatives with access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and records (for the
purpose of examining and copying) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date for purposes
of preparing tax returns or filings, accounting or financial statements or
reports or filings under applicable securities laws or in connection with any

operations of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) nothing
herein shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or
to disclose any information to, the Seller or its authorized representatives
if such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to (x) waive any
legal privilege, or (y) be in violation of applicable law. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by the Seller, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven years
following the Closing Date, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books
and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to and
including the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the
Seller and offering to surrender to the Seller such books and records or any
portion thereof which the Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy or
dispose of.

 



 

8.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any provision in the Companys or its Subsidiaries
certificate of formation, certification of incorporation, articles of
incorporation, operating agreement, bylaws, or equivalent governing documents
relating to the exculpation or indemnification (including fee advancement) of
any officers and/or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
officer or director, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement that is adverse to such officers and/or directors (unless
required by Law) (collectively, the "Charter Indemnification Obligations"), it
being the intent of the parties that the Indemnified Persons shall continue to
be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification (including fee
advancement) thereunder to the full extent permitted by applicable Law. The
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor
and perform under all such Charter Indemnification Obligations owed to any of
the Indemnified Persons.

 



 

(b) If the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other Person and will
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each

 



      
 

 



 

such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.02_. The provisions of this _Section 8.02_ are
intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Person and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have had by contract or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made
against any Indemnified Person or any other party covered by directors and
officers liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section 8.02_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

 



 

8.03 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date until December 31, 2018, the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who were
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing
(the " _Transferred Employees_ ") with (i) base salary and target incentive
compensation (other than equity-based compensation) that is no less than the
base salary and target incentive compensation (other than equity-based
compensation) provided to such employees prior to the Closing and (ii) subject
to _Section 8.03(b)_, benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies that provide a level of benefits (other than equity based
compensation) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the
aggregate level of benefits provided under the Plans as of the Closing. The
Purchaser shall take all actions necessary so that employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for all purposes (other than
for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under
any compensation or benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies sponsored by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than any
equity-based arrangements and severance), except to the extent duplication of
benefits would result.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the later of the Closing Date or the date such Transferred
Employees would otherwise lose coverage under any Seller Plan that is a group
health plan, Seller shall offer to such Transferred Employees continued
coverage in such group health plan and their eligible dependents as if they
had incurred a qualifying event under Code Section 4980B and Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") as of the Closing Date (the "
_Continued Coverage_ "). Seller shall cause all offers, notices, elections,
premium payments and duration of Continued Coverage to be provided in
accordance with the requirements of COBRA, including the inclusion of an
administrative charge of up to 2% of the monthly premium. Purchaser shall (or
shall cause the Company to) make available a group health plan for medical,
dental and vision, coverage effective no later than January 1, 2019, to
Transferred Employees who are then employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
and Seller may terminate the Continued Coverage for Transferred Employees when
they become eligible for group health coverage through Purchaser or the
Company. From the Closing Date through the earlier of the (1) effective date
the Purchaser or its Affiliate makes medical, dental and vision coverage
available to the

 



      
 

 



 

Transferred Employees, or (2) the date such Transferred Employees Continued
Coverage ceases (e.g., Transferee Employees non-payment of premium), the
Company shall reimburse 80% of each Transferred Employees Continued Coverage
premiums as soon as practicable following such Transferred Employee providing
evidence of premium payment. The Company shall reimburse Seller, as soon as
reasonably practicable following delivery of a notice therefor and reasonable
evidence thereof, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses not
reimbursable through insurance or otherwise it directly incurs in connection
with complying with this _Section 8.03(b)_, including with respect to the
provision of health reimbursement accounts or HRAs to the Transferred
Employees.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser shall cause a Code Section 414(l) trust-to-trust transfer of the
account balances (and related assets and liabilities including participant
loan notes) of Transferred Employees in the AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k)
Retirement Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_") to the 401(k) plan adopted by
Purchaser or its Affiliate (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_"). Prior to such
transfer, each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence that it has
duly approved corporate and Plan documents that reasonably enable the transfer
to occur as of a mutually agreeable date. As a condition precedent to any
transfer of assets from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan,
each Party shall provide the other Party with (i) reasonable evidence that its
401(k) plan is tax-qualified within the meaning of sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the Code, and (ii) any other duly executed corporate or plan documents that
the other may reasonably require through advance notice to the other Party.
From the Closing Date until completion of the plan-to-plan transfer
contemplated herein, Seller agrees to cause the plan administrator of the
Seller 401(k) Plan to implement reasonable measures to prevent deemed
distribution of Transferred Employee loan balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan,
such as for example and without limitation extending the maximum cure period
for loan defaults (subject to the maximum limitations of Code Section 72(p)
and its associated regulations) and/or accepting loan repayments from
Transferred Employees via check.

 



 

(d) Seller agrees that the Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 who incur a
qualifying event under any Seller Plan prior to or following the Closing. As
of and following the Closing Date, except as provided in _Section 8.03(c)_,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have any liability or obligation
under any Seller Plan.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including without
limitation _Section 7.01_, the Company shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, refund any amounts required to be paid under Sellers Employee Stock
Purchase Plan as a result of the Closing to the appropriate employees in
accordance with the terms of the Sellers Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and no
such amounts shall be taken into account as Current Liabilities, as items of
Indebtedness or as Transaction Expenses hereunder.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 8.03_ shall (i) confer upon any Person any right
to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or

 



      
 

 



 

any of their respective Affiliates, or interfere with or restrict in any way
the rights of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause, (ii) subject to compliance with this
_Section 8.03_, restrict Purchasers or the Companys or its Subsidiaries
right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan, (iii) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Plan or Purchaser
employee benefit plan, or (iv) give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement, including any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.03_ as a third-party
beneficiary.

 



 

8.04 _Regulatory Filings_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (a) promptly make
or cause to be made all filings, notices, applications and submissions
required to be made under any Laws applicable to the Purchaser for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
coordinate and cooperate with the Company and the Seller in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the Company and the Seller may
reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing, and (c) (i) supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable in connection
therewith and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary
to obtain all required clearances.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and with respect to the
Purchaser HSR Filing, within seven days), the Purchaser shall make or cause to
be made all filings and submissions under the HSR Act (the " _Purchaser HSR
Filing_ ") and any other material Laws or regulations applicable to the
transactions contemplated herein. The Purchaser shall coordinate and cooperate
with the Company and the Seller in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the Company and the Seller may reasonably request in
connection with all of the foregoing. The Purchaser shall be responsible for
all filing fees under the HSR Act. The Purchaser shall at the time of making
the Purchaser HSR Filing request early termination of the applicable premerger
waiting period.

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Governmental
Entity, the Purchaser will provide the Company and the Seller with prompt
notice of any communication (whether written or oral) received by it from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the foregoing, consult with the Company
and the Seller prior to providing any additional information to or otherwise
communicating (whether in written or oral form) with any Governmental Entity
with respect to the foregoing, and incorporate the reasonable comments of the
Company and the Seller in connection with providing any additional information
to or otherwise communicating (whether in written or oral form) with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be

 



      
 

 



 

required to agree to or effect (i) any license, divestiture, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any shares of its capital stock or other equity or ownership
interests or of any of its businesses, assets, business lines or properties,
or those of any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation or restriction on the
ability of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to conduct,
operate or manage any of their respective businesses, assets, business lines
or properties or own any capital stock or other equity or ownership interests
or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their
respective businesses, assets, business lines or properties and, in the case
of Purchaser, the business, assets, business lines or properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment,
condition or undertaking on Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
of any kind under any Law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,
order or other legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices (collectively, a " _Divestiture Action_ "). In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
regard to any Governmental Entity, none of the Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall, without Purchasers written consent in Purchasers
sole discretion, discuss or commit to any Divestiture Action, or discuss or
commit to alter the Companys or its Subsidiaries businesses, assets,
business lines, properties or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise
discuss or take or commit to take any action that limits Purchasers freedom
of action with respect to, or Purchasers ability to retain any of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries businesses, assets, business lines or
properties or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement, in
Purchasers sole discretion. Nothing herein shall require Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to litigate with any Person, or otherwise
contest or defend against any administrative, regulatory or judicial action or
proceeding or the imposition of any undertaking or condition or decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries shall not be permitted to, and shall not permit their respective
Affiliates to, unilaterally extend any waiting period and/or agree to pull and
refile under the HSR Act or any other applicable state, federal or foreign
antitrust, competition or similar Laws, other than under the HSR Act in which
case such parties shall be permitted to pull and refile one (1) time
unilaterally. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller may
compel the Purchaser to pull and refile under the HSR Act one (1) time
unilaterally, and Purchaser agrees, and agrees to cause its subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, comply with such request. All other extensions of any waiting
period and/or agreement to pull and refile under the HSR Act or any other
applicable state, federal or foreign antitrust, competition, or similar Laws,
shall require the mutual consent of Purchaser and Seller.

 



 

8.05 _Conditions_. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_ to be satisfied as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, subject to the provisions of _Section
2.01_ and completion of the Marketing Period, to cause the Closing to occur as
expeditiously as possible following the execution of this Agreement, and,
subject to the provisions of _Section 2.01_ and completion of the Marketing
Period to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as
reasonably possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article III_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself, but
subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing).

 



      
 

 



 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of _Section
8.04_ and this _Section 8.05_, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit
the Guarantors or any of their controlled Affiliates to, intentionally take
any action that, Purchaser determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel (to the extent necessary to make such determination in
good faith), would be reasonably likely to prevent the conditions set forth in
_Section 3.02(c)_ from being satisfied or materially delay the conditions set
forth in _Section 3.02(c)_ from being satisfied, in each case, beyond the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date that the HSR Filing and the Purchaser HSR
Filing are filed with the applicable Governmental Entity, other than as
described on the _Permitted Acquisitions Schedule_ or as permitted pursuant to
_Section 8.04(e)_. Purchaser hereby agrees, from the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, give
its consent under the CCB Acquisition Agreement to any (i) acquisition by
merger or consolidation with, or by purchasing the assets of, any Person or
division thereof, or material portion of assets of any Person (other than
inventory) by CCB or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) acquisition of any
capital stock or any other securities or equity or ownership interests of any
Person by CCB or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), which are competitive with the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), as described
on the _Permitted Acquisitions Schedule_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
reasonably assist in the giving of the notices to third parties and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in obtaining any required third-
party consents described in the last sentence of _Section 7.04_, which shall
include, without limitation, (A) providing financial information of Purchaser
and/or any of its Subsidiaries to the San Francisco Landlord and any
counterparty (other than Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries)) whose consent is required under any Seller
Mutual Agreement or Company Used Seller Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated by _Sections 7.09(d)_ or _7.09(e)_ , in each case,
as reasonably requested by the San Francisco Landlord or such counterparty,
(B) solely with respect to the San Francisco Lease, delivering within ten (10)
days following the Closing a letter of credit in form and substance required
under the San Francisco Lease in an amount not to exceed $151,002.69, (C)
solely with respect to the San Francisco Lease, delivering a certificate of
good standing with respect to Purchaser issued by the office of the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, as reasonably requested by the San
Francisco Landlord and (D) solely with respect to the San Francisco Lease, to
the extent reasonably requested by the San Francisco Landlord, any information
specifically requested under Section 14.1(iv) of the San Francisco Lease with
respect to Purchaser and/or CCB ( _provided_ , that in the case of CCB, to the
extent such information is in the possession of Purchaser at such time and
Purchaser is permitted to disclose such information under the CCB Acquisition
Agreement or any other agreement between Purchaser and/or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and CCB and/or any of its direct or indirect
owners or Affiliates, on the other hand), in each case, to the extent
reasonably practicable for the Purchaser (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
including any information with respect to the Guarantors or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than Purchaser), owners or general or limited
partners); _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be
required to (1) modify or alter the terms of the agreement to which such
consent or notice relates or (2) except as described in clause (B) above in
this sentence, make any payments of money or provide any other inducement to
the other party or parties to such agreement.

 



 

8.06 _Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives may not contact and
communicate with any employee (other than Senior Personnel of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, any Person

 



      
 

 



 

who is a party to any Ancillary Agreement, any Specified Employee (during the
Specified Period only), any Person who is included in clause (i) of the
definition of Knowledge, any Accepting Service Provider or any Considering
Specified Employee (during the Specified Period and each Extension Period
applicable to such Considering Specified Employee)), customer, Service
Provider, or supplier of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless (a) it
obtains prior written approval of the Company or (b) such contact or
communication is completely unrelated to the transactions contemplated hereby,
does not include mention of the Seller, the Company, their respective
Subsidiaries, or any other matter contemplated hereby, and is not intended to
seek or obtain any information regarding the Seller, the Company, and their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

8.07 _Purchaser Audit Cooperation_. During the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of March 31, 2019 and the date on which
Seller completes its audit for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with any reasonable
requests by Seller with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on the Closing Date, and if
reasonably necessary, access to its auditors, in each case, in connection with
Sellers audit for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any such requests shall require
reasonable advance notice to Purchaser in writing (for which e-mail pursuant
to _Section 13.04_ shall be sufficient), (b) such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of Purchaser, the Company or
its Subsidiaries, and (c) nothing herein shall require Purchaser, the Company
or its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or to disclose any information to,
Seller, its Subsidiaries or its authorized representatives if such access or
disclosure would reasonably be expected to (x) waive any legal privilege, or
(y) be in violation of applicable law.

 



 

8.08 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (as the same may be amended, modified
or replaced in accordance with this _Section 8.08_), including its reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply
with its obligations thereunder; (ii) negotiate and execute the financing
documents on terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"flex" provisions related thereto); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis, or obtain
a waiver of, the conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter that are within the
Purchasers control (but excluding any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information
as required under _Section 7.06_ or the Companys or the Sellers breach of
any of their respective other obligations under this Agreement); (iv) subject
to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and upon the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, enforce its rights to
consummate the Debt Financing or to cause the Debt Financing Sources and the
other persons committing to fund the Debt Financing to fund the Financing at
the Closing under the Debt Commitment Letter (provided, however, that in no
event shall reasonable best efforts include any obligation on the part of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to commence or thereafter to commence any
litigation, arbitration, action or other adjudicatory or legal proceeding
against any Debt Financing Source); and (v) upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources and the other
persons committing to fund the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at
the Closing. The Purchaser shall not permit or agree to any termination,
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under,
or any replacement of, any of the Debt Commitment Letter if such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (A) reduces (or would have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), unless
the representation and warranty set forth in _Section 6.08_ hereof (as though
made at the time of the effectuation of such termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement) shall remain true and correct; or (B)
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Commitment Letter that are in the Purchasers control) on the Closing Date or
(y) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or solely to the extent definitive
loan agreements are entered into prior to the Closing Date, the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; provided that the Purchaser shall not be
deemed to have violated this _Section 8.08_ if the Purchaser shall have (A)
provided prior written notice to the Seller of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement or any other event, fact or circumstance
that would be restricted by the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.08_
and (B) demonstrated (to the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller) that it
has other funds available to it (on conditions not materially less favorable
in the aggregate to the Purchaser than the conditions to the Debt Commitment
Letter) that are sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letter).
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the Seller copies of any such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall (i)
promptly notify the Seller of such failure and the reasons therefor and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Debt Financing being replaced that is still available, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby with terms and conditions that
are not materially less favorable to the Purchaser, in the aggregate, than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (giving effect to
any applicable flex provisions), except as agreed by the Purchaser, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the "
_Alternative Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser shall not be required to execute any alternative Debt
Commitment Letter (and related documents) or arrange for such alternative debt
financing (x) on terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions of any
related fee letter) which are materially less favorable (taken as a whole)
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (after giving effect to the
"flex" provisions of any related fee letter) unless otherwise determined by
Purchaser in its sole discretion or (y) pay fees in the aggregate at Closing

 



      
 

 



 

which are in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, after
giving effect to the "flex" provisions of any related fee letters (whether to
secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). The Purchaser
shall as soon as reasonably practicable deliver a true, correct and complete
copy of each alternative financing commitment and related fee letters
(redacted consistently with _Section 6.08_) (collectively, a " _New Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") to the Company. Any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the date hereof, as permitted to be amended, modified or
replaced (in whole or in part) by this _Section 8.08_, including any
Alternative Debt Financing, and references to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall
include such debt commitment letters as permitted to be amended, modified or
replaced (in whole or in part) by this _Section 8.08_, including any New Debt
Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably
informed, upon the request of the Company, of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of
any breach of any material provisions of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive document related to the Debt Financing by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing of
which it has Knowledge, in each case to the extent such breach could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, and (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt
Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund
the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the
Closing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing (for
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not limit or modify the provisions
of _Section 13.19(c)_).

 



 

8.09 _2018 LTCIP Amounts_. Purchaser hereby agrees to pay, or cause to be
paid, the 2018 LTCIP Amount to the eligible employees and/or Service Providers
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, in accordance with _Schedule 8.09_ ,
as updated at the Closing, on the first payroll date of Cbr Systems occurring
following September 5, 2018, if and only if Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiary has not previously paid such 2018 LTCIP Amount prior to the Closing
Date.

the case of a purported termination by the Seller, not to be satisfied; and
(iii) if the satisfaction, or waiver in writing by the appropriate party, of
all of the conditions contained in _Article III_ (other than those conditions
that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to such conditions being able to be satisfied at the Closing) occurs three

nor Seller shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(d) _until the fourth Business Day after the Outside Date;

 



 

(e) by either the Purchaser or the Seller, if any Governmental Entity has

provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_, _Article
XII_ and _Article XIII_ and the Confidentiality Agreement), and there shall
be no Liability on the part of the Purchaser, the Company or the Seller to one
another, _provided_ that, except as provided in _Section 9.03_, no party

9.03 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Seller pursuant to _Section
9.01(f)_ or _Section 9.01(c)_ with respect to a breach of the covenants set
forth in _Section 8.08_, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, within
five (5) Business Days after such termination, to Seller a cash fee equal to
$37,100,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller,
it being understood that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay or
cause to be paid the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If the
Purchaser fails to timely pay the Termination Fee when due pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(a)_, and in order to obtain payment, the Seller commences a
Proceeding which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the
Purchaser and/or the Guarantors, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Seller its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such Proceeding, together with
interest on the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date hereof,
compounding quarterly from the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received (collectively, the "
_Seller Recovery Costs_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , if the Purchaser and/or
the Guarantors is the prevailing party in such Proceeding, the Seller shall
pay to the Purchaser any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Purchaser and/or the
Guarantors in connection with such Proceeding. Upon payment of the Termination
Fee (and any Seller Recovery Costs payable under and in accordance with this
_Section 9.03(a)_ and any amounts payable under and in accordance with
_Section 7.06(c)_) when due pursuant to this _Section 9.03(a)_, neither the
Purchaser nor any other Purchaser Related Party shall have any further
Liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing) to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, the Seller, any other Seller Related Party

 



      
 

 



 

or any other Person (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise), and upon such payment none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Seller, any other Seller Related Party or any other Person
shall have any claim or recourse against any Purchaser Related Party as a
result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
the Purchaser contained herein or otherwise arising out of or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity Financing and
the Debt Financing). Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall any
Seller Related Party seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of any of the
Seller Related Parties, any monetary damages from any Purchaser Related Party
in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing), other than
(without duplication) from the Purchaser (i) to the extent provided in this
_Section 9.03(a)_, or (ii) pursuant to a claim for monetary damages by Seller
(brought in the appropriate court with jurisdiction in accordance with
_Sections 13.16_ and _13.17_ ) for a Purchaser Willful Breach against
Purchaser (a " _Purchaser Willful Breach Claim_ ") ( _provided_ that (A) the
Seller Related Parties, in the aggregate, shall not be permitted or entitled
to recover damages in excess of an amount equal to two times (2x) the
Termination Fee in the aggregate (the " _Purchaser Damages Cap_ "), and (B)
for the avoidance of doubt, none of the Seller Related Parties shall be
permitted or entitled to recover damages that have not been awarded to the
Seller Related Parties in respect of a Purchaser Willful Breach by the
appropriate court (with jurisdiction in accordance with _Sections 13.16_ and
_13.17_ ), as finally determined by a judgment of such court (which is no
longer subject to further appeal or review)). Nothing in this _Section
9.03(a)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed to expand the circumstances in
which the Purchaser or any other Purchaser Related Party may be liable under
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary (but subject to _Section 13.19_), while Seller may pursue both
(x) a grant of a decree or order of specific performance or other equitable
relief, as and only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 13.19_, to
enforce the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letter and to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.01_
and (y) a Purchaser Willful Breach Claim (only to the extent expressly
permitted by this _Section 9.03_), under no circumstances shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both (i) such grant of a decree or order of
specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded and to effect the Closing and (ii) damages in respect of a
Purchaser Willful Breach Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event shall (i) the Seller Related Parties be entitled to
receive both the Termination Fee and monetary damages in respect of a
Purchaser Willful Breach Claim, or (ii) any Seller Related Party be entitled
to recover any monetary damages for a Purchaser Willful Breach Claim prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_;
_provided_ , nothing in this sentence shall preclude Seller from pursuing a
Purchaser Willful Breach Claim prior to the termination of this Agreement so
long as any award of monetary damages in respect thereof is conditioned upon
the prior or concurrent termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.01_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters to
the contrary, in the event that the Purchaser fails to effect the Closing for
any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement (or any
representation, warranty or

 



      
 

 



 

covenant hereof) (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise (other than a Purchaser Willful Breach)) or otherwise fails to
perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise (other than a Purchaser Willful Breach)), then, except for the right
of the Seller to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee and to
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to, and only to the extent expressly permitted by, _Section 13.19_
and Section 6 of the Equity Commitment Letter, the right of Seller (subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations hereof) to terminate this Agreement and
the right, if applicable, of the Seller to (without duplication) (x) receive
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_ and the Seller Recovery
Costs pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_, including from the Guarantors pursuant
to the Guarantee, or (y) make a Purchaser Willful Breach Claim ( _provided_
that (A) the Seller Related Parties, in the aggregate, shall not be permitted
or entitled to recover damages in excess of an amount equal to the Purchaser
Damages Cap, and (B) for the avoidance of doubt, none of the Seller Related
Parties shall be permitted or entitled to recover damages that have not been
awarded to the Seller Related Parties in respect of a Purchaser Willful Breach
by the appropriate court (with jurisdiction in accordance with _Sections
13.16_ and _13.17_ ), as finally determined by a judgment of such court (which
is no longer subject to further appeal or review)), shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Seller, (iii) any
former, current or future, direct or indirect, stockholder, member, owner,
member, director, manager, officer, employee, agent, representative, Affiliate
or assignee of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of the Seller or (iv)
any former, current or future, director, manager, officer, employee, agent,
representative, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (the Persons
described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be collectively referred to as the
" _Seller Related Parties_ " and individually as a " _Seller Related Party_ ")
against (A) the Purchaser or any of the Guarantors, (B) any former, current or
future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, owners or assignees of any of the Purchaser or the Guarantors,
(C) any lender, prospective lender, arranger or agent of or under the Debt
Financing or any of their respective former, current or future equityholders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, managers or
agents (including the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties), or (D) any holders or future holders of any capital stock or
other equity or ownership interest (including any options, warrants, calls,
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock or equity
rights, stock or equity appreciation rights, stock or equity based performance
units with respect to such interest or stock), controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners, stockholders, owners or assignees of any of the foregoing
(the Persons described in clauses (A) through (D) shall be collectively
referred to as the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ " and individually as a "
_Purchaser Related Party_ "), for any and all Losses of any kind or nature
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise)
in this Agreement or failure to perform under this Agreement (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or other failure of
the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Seller and the Company (on behalf of themselves and

 



      
 

 



 

any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, owners, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waive any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Sources or any Debt Financing
Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise and the Seller and the Company (on behalf of themselves and any
of their respective stockholders, partners, members, owners, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) agree not to
commence any Proceeding against any Debt Financing Sources or any Debt
Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement (including
any Proceeding relating to the Debt Financing) and agree to cause any such
Proceeding asserted by the Seller or the Company (whether on behalf of
themselves or any of the Companys stockholders, partners, members, owners,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in
connection with this Agreement (including any action related to the Debt
Financing) against any Debt Financing Sources to be dismissed or otherwise
terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is acknowledged and agreed that no Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing
Source Related Parties shall have any Liability for any claims, losses,
settlements, liabilities, damages (whether special, consequential, punitive,
or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature), costs, expenses, fines
or penalties to the Company or the Seller (or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, owners, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, following consummation
of the Transaction, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to
the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into
this Agreement, and that the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.03(a)_ does not constitute a penalty but constitutes payment of liquidated
damages and that the Companys and the Sellers liquidated damages amount is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by the Purchasers breach or default under this Agreement, the non-
feasibility of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and difficulty of
otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to
be consummated hereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 9.03_ are for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Purchaser Related Parties.

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 



 

10.01 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

 



 

(a) The Seller and the Company hereby inform the Purchaser that each of the
Company, the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries have retained Goodwin to
act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
that Goodwin has

 



      
 

 



 

not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties hereto has
the status of a client of Goodwin for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller hereby agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises under this Agreement after the Closing between the
Purchaser, the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Seller or its post-Closing Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, which shall
not include the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, (an "
_Agreement Dispute_ "), Goodwin may represent the Seller and/or such post-
Closing Affiliates in any Agreement Dispute even though the interests of the
Seller and/or such post-Closing Affiliates may be directly adverse to the
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though Goodwin may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such Agreement Dispute, or may be handling other matters for the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries that are not related to the Agreement
Dispute.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser further agrees that, in any Agreement Dispute, the portion
of the communications among Goodwin, the Seller and its respective Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), and, for communications made
prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, that (i) relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) are subject to the
attorney-client privilege (communications meeting the requirements of clauses
(i) and (ii) of this sentence are collectively referred to as the "
_Privileged Communications_ "), the attorneyclient privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller, may be controlled by
the Seller and, except as expressly provided in _Section 10.01(d)_, shall not
pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller hereby agree that the
protections afforded to the Seller in _Section 10.01(c)_ shall not be
considered, and is not, a waiver by the Purchaser, the Company or their
Subsidiaries of any attorney-client privilege that they may have over the
Privileged Communications as against any third party other than the Seller and
its post-Closing Affiliates (an " _Unaffiliated Party_ "). In the event of a
dispute between the Purchaser, the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one
hand, and an Unaffiliated Party, on the other hand, (an " _Unaffiliated Party
Suit_ "), the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of any Privileged
Communications to such Unaffiliated Party; _provided_ , however, that none of
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Seller for any Third-Party Claim
subject to indemnification by the Seller under _Section 11.02(a)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the
event that any of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries is required
or requested by governmental order, other order or request of a tribunal of
competent jurisdiction, or by request or order of any Governmental Entity, to
produce, or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of, all or a portion of a
Privileged Communication, the Purchaser shall be entitled to so produce,
access or obtain such Privileged Communication, _provided that_ , to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and such order, tribunal and/or
Governmental Entity (as applicable), as soon as reasonably practicable
following such a request or order, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in
writing so that the Seller can seek such remedy as may be available to

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller to prevent the production or disclosure of, or access to, any of
such Privileged Communications or maintain the confidentiality of any of such
Privileged Communications. Where the Seller seeks such a remedy regarding such
Privileged Communications in an Unaffiliated Party Suit, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and such order, tribunal and/or Governmental
Entity (as applicable), the Purchaser agrees to reasonably assist the Seller
in seeking such remedy.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser agrees that, in any Agreement Dispute, it will not, and that
it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to not, use or rely on any of
the Privileged Communications. Each of the Purchaser and, after the Closing,
the Company, agree not to assert that the attorney-client privilege has been
waived as to the Privileged Communications that may be located in the records
or email server (or in the knowledge of the officers and employees) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Privileged Communications may be used
by the Seller and/or any of its post-Closing Affiliates in connection with any
Agreement Dispute, including in any claim for indemnification brought by the
Purchaser.

 



 

10.02 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at Sellers expense, all
Income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that have not yet been filed and are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, including the Seller Groups
consolidated return for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. The Seller Group
shall include the Company and its Subsidiaries on its consolidated U.S.
federal income Tax Return and any other consolidated Tax Returns for the
period up to and including the Closing Date. Seller shall pay or cause to be
paid any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to any income
Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary that is not a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes the Company or any Subsidiary
(each a " _Standalone Tax Return_ "), the Seller shall prepare such Tax Return
consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Law and
Seller shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Purchaser a draft of any
such Tax Return at least 30 days prior to the due date, giving effect to
extensions thereto, for filing such Tax Return, for review by the Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , if Seller shall fail to provide any such Standalone
Tax Return due after the Closing Date to Purchaser as set forth in this
_Section 10.02(a)(i)_, Purchaser may prepare and file such Tax Return at
Sellers expense. The Purchaser shall file such Standalone Tax Returns, and
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser any Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries due in respect of such Standalone Tax Returns at least
ten (10) days before the date on which the Purchaser or the Company or its
Subsidiaries would be required to pay such Taxes to the extent such Taxes were
not taken into account to reduce the purchase price through Indebtedness or
Net Working Capital,

 



      
 

 



 

each as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_ (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid any such finally determined
Taxes taken into account in Indebtedness or Net Working Capital, each as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_, to the applicable taxing
authority). The Purchaser and Seller agree to deduct the Transaction Tax
Deductions on the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and shall file all Tax Returns consistently therewith. The Purchaser shall
notify Seller of any reasonable objections the Purchaser has to any items set
forth on a draft Standalone Tax Return delivered by Seller to Purchaser for
review and the Purchaser and Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith
any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any such objections within
fifteen (15) days after Seller submits such Tax Return to the Purchaser, the
item in question shall be resolved by the Dispute Advisory Firm the fees and
expenses of which shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, in that percentage of the fees and expenses of
the Dispute Advisory Firm equal to the proportion (expressed as a percentage
and determined by the Dispute Advisory Firm) of the dollar value of the
disputed amounts determined in favor of the other party by the Dispute
Advisory Firm.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are either (A) Tax
Returns for Straddle Periods or (B) Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date that are not Standalone Tax Returns (each, a "
_Purchaser Tax Return_ "). The Purchaser shall prepare such Purchaser Tax
Returns consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable
Law and Purchaser shall deliver a draft of any such Purchaser Tax Return that
is an income Tax Return to the Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date thereof or for any such Purchaser Tax Return that is a non-income Tax
Return with respect to which Purchaser will seek indemnification under this
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than in
connection with making such indemnification) (in each case, taking into
account any extensions of the due date), and the Purchaser shall allow the
Seller to comment on such Purchaser Tax Return. Seller shall notify the
Purchaser of any reasonable objections Seller has to any items set forth in
such draft Purchaser Tax Return and the Purchaser and Seller agree to consult
and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve
any such objections within fifteen (15) days after the Purchaser submits such
Purchaser Tax Return to Seller, the item in question shall be resolved by the
Dispute Advisory Firm the fees and expenses of which shall be borne by Seller,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in that percentage of
the fees and expenses of the Dispute Advisory Firm equal to the proportion
(expressed as a percentage and determined by the Dispute Advisory Firm) of the
dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other party by
the Dispute Advisory Firm; provided that, in the event such objections cannot
be resolved by the parties prior to the due date of such Purchaser Tax Return
(taking into account extensions), Purchaser shall be entitled to file such
Purchaser Tax Return and Purchaser shall promptly amend such Purchaser Tax
Return following resolution by the parties and/or Dispute Advisory Firm to the
extent necessary to reflect such resolution. Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes attributable to the portion of the
underlying Straddle Period ending on the end of the Closing Date due with any
Purchaser Tax Returns at least ten (10) days before the date on which the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be required to pay
such Taxes to the extent such Taxes were not taken into account to reduce the
purchase price through Indebtedness or Net Working Capital, each as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_. Seller shall be responsible for the
portion of expenses for preparing any Purchaser Tax Return equal to the
product of such expenses and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the portion of the underlying Straddle Period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(iii) With respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to a
Straddle Period, the portion of any Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period will be determined as follows: (i) in the case of real property
Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, the amount of
such Taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in such entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all
other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries terminated at the end of the Closing Date. For purposes of
computing Pre-Closing Taxes (i) the taxable year of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries that is a "controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in the
Code) shall be deemed to have closed on the Closing Date for purposes of
computing any inclusion under Sections 951 and 951A of the Code and the
determination of any related foreign tax credits, and (ii) income Tax
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be calculated assuming
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or is making an
election described in Section 965(h) of the Code with respect to inclusions
under Section 965(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Seller will each pay fifty percent
(50%) of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed, directly or indirectly, on the Company or the Seller as a
result of the purchase and sale of stock pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with
respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to cooperate
with each other in the filing of any returns with respect to Transfer Taxes,
including by promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

 



 

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any Affiliate of the Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, excluding this Agreement, shall be terminated and all payables and
receivables arising thereunder shall be settled, in each case prior to the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder or under
any payables or receivables arising thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter and Tax Elections_. The Purchaser
shall not take any action with respect to the Company or cause or permit the
Company to take any action that would cause the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described
in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-11. No election under
Section 338(h)(10) or 336(e) of the Code shall be made with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller
shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and
any action, suit, demand or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request
and expense) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such action, suit, demand or other proceeding. The Purchaser,
the Company and the Seller agree to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the purchase
price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the Parties on their
Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(g) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt of any
written notice, or becoming aware, of any audit, examination, or proceeding
with respect to Taxes that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be
reasonable grounds for a Tax indemnification claim in favor of the Purchaser
under _Article XI_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give such prompt notice shall not affect Sellers indemnification
obligations under this Agreement except to the extent Seller is materially
prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall have the right, directly or through its designated
representatives, to control the defense of any Tax Claim, including the
settlement thereof, provided that (i) Seller provides written notice electing
to control such Tax Claim within ten (10) days after becoming aware of the
assertion of such Tax Claim, (ii) the defense of such Tax Claim can be
conducted separately from the defense of any claim, suit, action or
proceedings not subject to this _Section 10.02(g)_, (iii) Sellers counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, (iv) Seller shall thereafter consult
with the Purchaser upon the Purchasers reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such Tax Claim, and (v) with
respect to a Tax Claim impacting only the Company and its Subsidiaries and for
the avoidance of doubt not including a Tax Return of the Seller Group, Seller
shall not, without the Purchasers prior written consent, agree

 



      
 

 



 

to any settlement with respect to any Tax if such settlement could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect any Tax liability of the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of the Purchaser (including following the Closing, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries). With respect to a Tax Claim
impacting only the Company and its Subsidiaries and for the avoidance of doubt
not including a Tax Return of the Seller Group, if Seller assumes such
defense, the Purchaser shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate
in the defense thereof to the extent it involves the Company or its
Subsidiaries and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by Seller. With respect to a Tax Claim impacting only the
Company and its Subsidiaries and for the avoidance of doubt not including a
Tax return of the Seller Group, the Purchaser, at the Purchasers sole cost
and expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall have the right to control any such Tax Claim;
provided that Seller at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Claim, and to the extent such Tax Claim
could reasonably be expected to affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller is
liable under this Agreement, such settlement shall not be agreed to by the
Purchaser without the consent of Seller, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Purchaser shall control all other Tax
Claims with respect to any Tax liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Seller shall be liable for any Losses resulting from any Tax audit or other
examination of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date whether or not such Tax
audit or other examination results in any adjustment of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries liability for Taxes.

 



 

(iii) To the extent this _Section 10.02(g)_ conflicts with the provisions of
_Section 11.03_, this _Section 10.02(g)_ shall control. To the extent this
_Section 10.02(g)_ conflicts with the provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy,
the RandW Insurance Policy shall control.

 



 

(h) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent taken into account in the calculation
of Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_,
taken into account in calculating the Final Cash Consideration or subject to a
payment obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries to another Person that
is in effect on or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall be entitled to
any refund or credit for overpayment of Taxes (in lieu of a refund) (including
any interest paid by a Governmental Entity thereon) received by the Company or
its Subsidiaries prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date (a " _Tax
Refund_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of Taxes paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or before
the Closing Date. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any Tax Refund to which
the Seller is entitled, the Purchaser or the Company shall, or shall cause the
applicable Subsidiary to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, such Tax Refund to an account or accounts
designated by the Seller, net of any Taxes and other expenses incurred to
obtain such Tax Refunds. The Purchaser will, and will cause the Company and

 



      
 

 



 

its Subsidiaries to, at the Sellers expense, execute such documents, take
reasonable additional actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be
necessary for the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries to perfect their
rights in and obtain all Tax Refunds for which any such Person is eligible and
to which the Seller is entitled. None of the Purchaser, the Company, or its
Subsidiaries shall forfeit, fail to collect or otherwise minimize any Tax
Refund to which the Seller would be entitled under this _Section 10.02(h)_,
except as required by applicable Laws. In the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of Tax Refunds to which the Seller is entitled shall be determined as
if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, if any such refunds that are subsequently
required to be paid back to a Governmental Entity (each, a " _Disallowed Tax
Benefit_ "), then such refunds shall be indemnifiable Losses for which the
Seller shall indemnity the Purchaser pursuant to _Article XI_.

 



 

(i) _Amendments to Returns; Post-Closing Items_. Except as otherwise (i)
required by applicable Law, (ii) mutually agreed to by Seller and Purchaser in
writing, or (iii) specifically contemplated by this Agreement, following the
Closing, the Purchaser shall not file an amended Tax Return for the Company or
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, make any voluntary disclosure
with respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make any Tax election which
would have retroactive effect for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, or change any
accounting method with retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and that
shifts taxable income from a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the
Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or shifts deductions or losses from a
Pre-Closing Tax Period to a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the
Closing Date, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Seller
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
addition, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall make any election
under Section 338 or 336(e) of the Code or any state, local or foreign law
equivalent in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(j) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not elect to reduce the Tax basis
of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries assets in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

10.03 _Solicitation and Other Matters Regarding Specified Employees_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, during the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the date that is thirty (30) days thereafter (the " _Initial
Specified Period_ ," and the Initial Specified Period together with any
Extension Periods, the " _Specified Period_ "): (i) the Purchaser shall have
the right to, directly or indirectly, solicit and/or attempt to solicit any
individual set forth on the _Specified Employee Schedule_ (the " _Specified
Employees_ ") to cease his or her employment with the Seller or the applicable
Subsidiary thereof and to become an employee of the Purchaser, the Company
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case effective upon the Closing, and
the Purchaser, the Company and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
have the right to hire any Specified Employee with such employment becoming
effective upon the Closing; and (ii) Seller agrees that, during the Specified
Period, it will not, either directly or indirectly, and will not permit any
Covered Entity to, either directly or indirectly, in each case, either on
Sellers or any Covered

 



      
 

 



 

Entitys behalf or on behalf of any other Person, (A) solicit or attempt to
solicit, aid or induce any Specified Employee to (1) continue to be an
employee of, or to otherwise provide services to, Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Covered Entities following the Closing, or (2) reject or
otherwise not accept employment with the Purchaser, the Company and/or any of
their respective Subsidiaries upon the Closing, including, in either case of
clauses (1) or (2), making any offers or counteroffers to any Specified
Employee with respect to his or her employment or any other proposed Service
Provider relationship with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or other Covered
Entities, or (B) take any action to assist or aid any other Person in
soliciting or taking any other action described in the foregoing clause
(ii)(A) with respect to any Specified Employee; _provided_ that during the
Specified Period, Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries and any other Covered
Entity (and any employee thereof) (x) may continue ordinary course
conversations with Specified Employees regarding the conduct of their
employment and related matters (including compensation) to the extent such
conversations are not related to or in violation of the substance of the
foregoing restrictions in this clause (ii), and (y) in connection with any
questions from any Specified Employee which may relate to the substance of the
foregoing restrictions in this clause (ii), may reference this Agreement and
that they are not permitted to expressly discuss such restricted matters with
the Specified Employee (such questions related to the foregoing restricted
matters, the " _Specified Employee Questions_ "). Seller or a Covered Entity
shall promptly notify the Purchaser of Specified Employee Questions and Seller
(and the applicable Covered Entity) shall, in good faith, consult with
Purchaser regarding how to appropriately respond to the applicable Specified
Employees Specified Employee Questions and shall comply with Purchasers
reasonable requests in such responses.

 



 

(b) At the end of each of the first three seven (7)-day periods during the
Specified Period, and at the conclusion of the Specified Period (prior to any
extension pursuant to _Section 10.03(c)_ below), the Purchaser shall notify
Seller in writing of (i) each Specified Employee who has accepted an
employment offer with the Purchaser, the Company and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (an " _Accepting Specified Employee_ "), (ii) each
Specified Employee who Purchaser has determined will not accept an employment
offer with Purchaser, the Company and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(a " _Rejecting Specified Employee_ "), and (iii) with respect to each other
Specified Employee, whether Purchaser intends to continue soliciting such
Specified Employee to accept an employment offer with Purchaser, the Company
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any such Specified Employee who
Purchaser intends to continue soliciting, a " _Considering Specified Employee_
" and any such Specified Employee who Purchaser notifies Seller it does not
intend to continue soliciting, shall thereafter be treated as a Rejecting
Specified Employee). The restrictions on Seller and/or any Covered Entity set
forth in _Section 10.03(a)_ with respect to Specified Employees shall
continue to be in force and apply with respect to each Accepting Specified
Employee until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and, with respect to each Considering
Specified Employee, until such Considering Specified Employee becomes a
Rejecting Specified Employee, notwithstanding the end of the Specified Period
or any Extension Period. The restrictions in _Section 10.03(a)_ with respect
to Specified Employees shall cease to apply to any Rejecting Specified
Employee as of the date of notification delivered to the Seller that such
Specified Employee is a Rejecting Specified Employee.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) If at the end of the Initial Specified Period any Specified Employees are
Considering Specified Employees, the Initial Specified Period shall be deemed
to automatically extend for an additional fifteen (15) day period (the "
_First Extension Period_ "), during which the restrictions on Seller and/or
any Covered Entity set forth in _Section 10.03(a)_ shall continue to be in
force and apply with respect to such Considering Specified Employees;
_provided_ that a maximum of ten (10) Specified Employees can remain treated
as Considering Specified Employees during the First Extension Period, and to
the extent there are more than ten (10) Considering Specified Employees as of
the end of the Initial Specified Period, Purchaser shall be required to
identify in writing to Seller those who will remain Considering Specified
Employees following the end of the Initial Specified Period, and all other
Specified Employees who are not Accepting Specified Employees or remaining
Considering Specified Employees shall automatically become Rejecting Specified
Employees upon delivery by Purchaser of such writing. At the end of the first
seven (7) day period during the First Extension Period and at the end of the
First Extension Period, the Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing of (i)
each Considering Specified Employee that has accepted an employment offer with
the Purchaser (and each such Considering Specified Employee shall thereafter
be an Accepting Specified Employee), (ii) each Considering Specified Employee
who Purchaser has determined will not accept an employment offer with
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (and each such
Considering Specified Employee shall thereafter be a Rejecting Specified
Employee), and (iii) the remaining Considering Specified Employees not
described in clauses (i) and (ii).

 



 

(d) If at the end of the First Extension Period any Specified Employees are
Considering Specified Employees, the Specified Period shall be deemed to
automatically extend for a second and final additional fifteen (15) day period
(the " _Second Extension Period_ " and, together with the First Extension
Period, the " _Extension Periods_ "), during which the restrictions on Seller
and/or any Covered Entity set forth in _Section 10.03(a)_ shall continue to
be in force and apply with respect to such Considering Specified Employees. At
the end of the first seven (7) day period during the Second Extension Period
and at the end of the Second Extension Period, the Purchaser shall notify
Seller in writing of (i) each Considering Specified Employee that has accepted
an employment offer with the Purchaser (and each such Considering Specified
Employee shall thereafter be an Accepting Specified Employee), and (ii) each
of the other Considering Specified Employees (and each such other Considering
Specified Employees shall thereafter be a Rejecting Specified Employee). At
the end of the Second Extension Period, any Specified Employee who remains a
Considering Specified Employee (and not an Accepting Specified Employee) shall
automatically become a Rejecting Specified Employee.

 



 

(e) During the period commencing on the day immediately following the last day
of the Specified Period (taking into account any Extension Periods) and ending
on the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause
their Subsidiaries to, cooperate in good faith to minimize any material
disruption to the business of the Seller and its Affiliates in connection with
the transition of Accepting Specified Employees to Purchaser (or the Company
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries) and Rejecting Specified Employees
to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or any

 



      
 

 



 

of its Subsidiaries), and there shall be no restriction on discussions between
Seller and the Covered Entities and the Rejecting Specified Employees. With
respect to each Rejecting Specified Employee, during the period commencing on
the date on which notice was delivered by Purchaser to Seller identifying such
Rejecting Specified Employee as a Rejecting Specified Employee and ending on
the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall be prohibited
from contacting any Rejecting Specified Employees without the express written
consent of the Seller, except to respond to communications from any Rejecting
Specified Employees with such responses limited to reference to this Agreement
and that they are not permitted to communicate any further with the Rejecting
Specified Employee (such communications " _Rejecting Specified Employee
Questions_ "). Purchaser shall notify the Seller of any Rejecting Specified
Employee Questions and Purchaser shall, in good faith, consult with Seller
regarding how to appropriately respond to the applicable Rejecting Specified
Employees Rejecting Specified Employee Questions to minimize any material
disruption to the business of the Seller and its Affiliates or to the
applicable Rejecting Specified Employees and shall comply with Sellers
reasonable requests in such responses.

 



 

(f) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall, after reasonable consultation with
Purchaser, transfer the employment of any Accepting Specified Employees to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, along with taking any ancillary actions related
thereto as reasonably necessary (e.g. transfer of payroll information),
between such entities in order to give effect to the provisions of this
_Section 10.03_ and the agreements of the parties in this _Section 10.03_,
and all the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate in good faith with respect to the foregoing and to minimize any
material disruption to the business of the Seller, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) Seller agrees that, upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser, it shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such further instruments and take such other actions
as may be necessary or desirable to effectuate the transfer of employment of
any Accepting Specified Employee to the Purchaser, the Company and/or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as requested by the Purchaser, effective upon
the Closing.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,
Seller, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall transfer each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth on the _Transferred Seller
Employee Schedule_ (the " _Transferred Seller Employees_ ") and each Rejecting
Specified Employee from the Company or its Subsidiaries to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and
shall take such further action reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the
transfer of the employment of the Transferred Seller Employees or Rejecting
Specified Employee to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

 



 

(i) For purposes of this _Section 10.03_, (i) " _Control_ " means the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of another
Person, directly or

 



      
 

 



 

indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise; and the terms " _Controlling_ " and " _Controlled_ " have meanings
correlative to the foregoing; and (ii) " _Covered Entity_ " means every
Affiliate of Seller, and every other Person Controlled by Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller. The agreements of Seller contained in this _Section
10.03_ specifically apply to each Person that is a Covered Entity as of the
date hereof or that becomes a Covered Entity after the date hereof.

indemnification), such representations and warranties shall be deemed to not

attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Indemnitee in obtaining such
recovery (collectively, " _Recovery Costs_ ") and (B) the amount of any Tax
benefits actually realized in the form of a reduction in income Tax liability
of the Company and its Affiliates in the taxable year that includes the

liability that the Company and its Affiliates would have had absent the Loss).

disallowance and such disallowed Tax benefit shall be treated as a "Disallowed
Tax Benefit" for purposes of this Agreement. If an Indemnitee or its
Affiliates receives any such recovery described in clause (A) above in respect
of Losses that was not previously taken into account after an indemnification
payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made in respect of such Losses,
then such Indemnitee or its Affiliates shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any indemnification payment made by such Indemnifying
Party in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of the of
such recovery actually received by the Indemnitee, net of any Recovery Costs,
and (b) the amount of the indemnification payment with respect to such Losses
previously received by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates from such Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnitee shall take all commercially reasonable actions to seek
full and prompt recovery under all third party insurance policies (including
the RandW Insurance Policy) and any indemnification rights covering any Losses
to the same extent as if it would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, only after the
amount of any deductibles, retentions or similar costs have been satisfied and
only to the extent such policies cover such Losses). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (x) the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be required to seek recovery under the RandW

 



      
 

 



 

Insurance Policy with respect to any claims relating to Fraud, (y) the

(v) the Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity pursuant to this _Article XI_ more
than once in respect of any Loss to the extent Purchaser has already received
an indemnification payment under this _Article XI_ for such amount of such
Loss; and

 



 

(vi) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any right to indemnification under
this _Article XI _with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such

_Section 1.04_ (for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section
11.02(c)(vi)_ shall not limit the Purchasers rights with respect to any
amounts it is owed under _Section 1.05_ that it has not been paid in
accordance with _Section 1.05_).

Loss from the Seller relating to Taxes, including with respect to breaches of
the Tax Reps (other than any such Loss resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.09(h)_, _(i)_ , and
_(q)_ and any interest and penalties imposed for taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date with respect to Taxes imposed for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date) shall be limited to
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) the
limitations set forth in _Section 11.02(c)(i)_, _11.02(c)(ii)_ and
_11.02(c)(iii)_ shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or
other obligations the Seller or the Purchaser) with respect to any claims
relating to (1) any Fraud or (2) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
Company Fundamental Reps, Seller Fundamental Reps or Purchaser Fundamental
Reps and (B) Losses with respect to any claims relating to any of the Company
Fundamental Reps, Seller Fundamental Reps or Purchaser Fundamental Reps shall
not be counted towards the Indemnity Cap.

 



 

(ix) Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, (A) except in the
case of Fraud, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be
recovered by the Purchaser for all claims for indemnification under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement shall be an amount equal to the Final Cash Consideration, and (B)
the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by Purchaser
for claims relating to Fraud shall be an amount equal to the Base
Consideration.

 



 

11.03 _Claims Notice_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Person seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.02_ (the " _Indemnitee_ ") has knowledge of any event or circumstance that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to indemnification under this
_Article XI_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (as defined below) (a
" _Direct Claim_ ") or receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
claim by a third party that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
indemnification under this _Article XI_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnitee shall deliver to the Person from which indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail a description of the matter giving rise to
indemnification hereunder, including, if known, the anticipated Losses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any failure or delay by the Indemnitee in
delivering a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the
Indemnitees right to indemnification under this _Article XI_, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by such failure
or delay.

 



 

(b) Promptly, but in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days, after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice of a Third-Party Claim
(unless the Third-Party Claim requires a response before the expiration of
such twenty (20) Business Day period, in which case no later than ten (10)
days before the required response), such Indemnifying Party may, at its option
and subject to the Indemnifying Party providing an Indemnification
Acknowledgement to the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim,
assume the defense of the Indemnitee against such claim (including the
employment of counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choosing that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee (the party conducting the defense of such Third-
Party Claim is referred to herein as the " _Controlling Party_ " and the other
party is referred to herein as the " _Non-Controlling Party_ "). The Non-
Controlling Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, shall reasonably
cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against, such claim. Except with
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default judgment or
consent to an entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
(i) relates solely to money damages to be paid entirely by the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release by such
third party of each Indemnitee, (iii) does not contain any admission or
finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnitee, and (iv) does not impose
any restriction on the Indemnitee or any injunctive or equitable relief
against the Indemnitee. Until the Indemnifying Party shall have so assumed the
defense of the Indemnitee against such claim following the delivery of such
Claim Notice, the Indemnitee may, but shall not be obligated to, undertake the
defense of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that (x) such Indemnitee, except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall not settle or compromise
any Third-Party Claim or permit a default judgment or consent to an entry of
judgment, and (y) if such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this
_Article XI_ (as

 



      
 

 



 

determined by an agreement of the parties or by a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), all reasonable out-of-pocket
legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Party. Any Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the
defense thereof either (I) at its own expense or (II) at the Indemnifying
Partys cost and expense if (1) the employment of such counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (2) on the
reasonable advice of legal counsel to the Indemnitee, a conflict or potential
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party
that would make such separate representation advisable or (3) one or more
defenses are available to the Indemnitee that are not available to the
Indemnifying Party. After any such claim has been filed or initiated, each
party shall make available to the other parties and their attorneys and
accountants all reasonably pertinent information under its control relating to
such claim which is made available under the terms of a confidentiality
agreement or similar protective measures, and the parties agree to render to
each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other in
order to facilitate the proper and adequate defense of any such claim.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.03_ to the contrary, if the
Indemnitee is one or more Purchaser Indemnitee, then Purchaser (or another
Purchaser Indemnitee) will have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third-
Party Claim that (i) involves any possibility of criminal liability or any
action by any Governmental Entity against any Purchaser Indemnitee, (ii)
involves any material customer or material supplier of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (iii) seeks injunctive relief, specific performance or other
equitable relief against any of the Purchaser Indemnitees, (iv) the insurer
under the RandW Insurance Policy exercises a right to defend or control such
Third-Party Claim, (v) involves any claim or Proceeding with respect to Taxes
(provided, that the parties rights with respect to claims or Legal
Proceedings relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be governed by and
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.02(g)_), or (vi) if determined
adversely to any of the Purchaser Indemnitees, could (together with all other
pending claims) reasonably be expected to result in Losses to the Purchaser
Indemnitees in an amount that is more than 1.33 times the maximum amount that
the Indemnifying Party would be responsible for after application of the
limitations on indemnification in this Agreement (including the Basket Amount
and the Indemnity Cap).

 



 

11.04 _Recovery of Losses_. With respect to any indemnification claim made
pursuant to this _Article XI_, all indemnifiable Losses shall be paid as
follows:

 



 

(a) With respect to the Seller, the Seller shall promptly pay to the Purchaser
the amount of the Purchasers Losses indemnifiable by the Seller pursuant to
_Section 11.02(a)_ by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by
the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) With respect to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the

_Article XI_ shall provide the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the
parties hereto with respect to any and all claims in any way relating to or
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether hereunder, at law
or otherwise, including a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by any party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the limitations in this Section 11.05(a) shall not apply with respect
to (i) the determination of the Final Cash Consideration, which shall be
governed by _Section 1.04_, (ii) any claims relating to any of the Ancillary
Agreements, (iii) any claims for equitable remedies, or (iv) the Purchaser
Indemnitees rights under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(b) The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of, or compliance with, any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

 



 

11.06 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall,
to the extent required by applicable Law, take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

11.07 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payment required to be made pursuant to
this _Article XI_ shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Final Cash Consideration, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

11.08 _No Circular Recovery_. Seller hereby waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that Seller shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or
advancement of expenses or other right or remedy (including under any
provisions of any Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Purchaser Indemnitee in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which Seller may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument delivered to
Purchaser in connection with this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIII

 



 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

13.01 _Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. The Purchaser
acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent
investigation and verification of the financial condition, results of
operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, that the Purchaser has been provided sufficient
access to the properties, records and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for this purpose, and, in making its determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser has relied
solely and exclusively on the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly and specifically set forth in _Article IV_, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, and the representations and warranties of the Seller
expressly and specifically set forth in _Article V_, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, and the representations and warranties set forth in the
Ancillary Agreements. Such representations and warranties by the Company or
the Seller, as applicable, constitute the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of the Company or the Seller, as applicable, to the Purchaser
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Purchaser
understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including any relating
to the future or historical financial condition, results of operations, assets
or liabilities of the Company, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries assets) are specifically disclaimed by the
Company and the Seller. The Purchaser expressly disclaims reliance on any
omissions of any representations and warranties of the Company in _Article
IV_ and the Seller in _Article V_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES OR
PROVIDES, AND THE PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS AND
ITS SUBSIDIARIES ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF. In connection with the
Purchasers investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
has received certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain business plan information. The Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is
familiar with such uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports and other
forecasts and plans. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that
neither the Seller nor the Company is making any representation or warranty
with respect to such estimates, projections, budgets,

 



      
 

 



 

pipeline reports and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline
reports, forecasts and plans, and that the Purchaser has not relied on any
such estimates, projections, budgets, pipeline reports or other forecasts or
plans. The Purchaser further agrees that (i) neither the Seller nor the
Company or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to the
Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the
Purchaser, or the Purchasers use of, any such information, including any
information, document or material made available to the Purchaser in certain
"data rooms," management presentations, the confidential information
memorandum, or any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including liability related to the completeness or accuracy
of any such information, and (ii) the Purchaser has not relied on any such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement: (a) nothing in this Section 13.01 shall in any way limit any of the
representations or warranties set forth in _Article IV_, in _Article V_ or
in any of the Ancillary Agreements; and (b) nothing in this Agreement shall,
or shall be deemed or construed to, waive or release any claims related to
Fraud.

 



 

13.02 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other
than Senior Personnel, any employee party to any Ancillary Agreement, any
Specified Employee (during the Specified Period only), any Accepting Specified
Employee, any Considering Specified Employee (during the Specified Period and
each Extension Period applicable to such Considering Specified Employee) or
any Person who is included in clause (i) of the definition of Knowledge),
shall be issued or made by any party hereto (or any Affiliate of a party
hereto) without the joint approval of the Purchaser and the Seller, unless
required by Law or the listing requirements of the Nasdaq (on the reasonable
advice of counsel) in which case the Purchaser and the Seller shall have the
right to review such press release, announcement or communication prior to
issuance, distribution or publication to the extent reasonably practicable and
permitted by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Seller and its Affiliates may provide
general information about the subject matter of this Agreement in connection
with their fundraising and/or SEC filing and reporting activities, (ii)
Purchaser and its Affiliates may make customary disclosures to their
respective current and prospective investors in connection with fundraising
and/or reporting activities, (iii) if a press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein is jointly
approved by the Purchaser and the Seller has been made (an " _Approved
Release_ "), Purchaser or Seller or their respective Affiliates may make other
press release or public announcements without obtaining additional approval
under this Section 13.02 to the extent such release or announcement contains
only such information concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein contained in an Approved Release. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, unless required by Law or the listing
requirements of the Nasdaq (on the reasonable advice of counsel), the
Purchaser, and after the Closing, the Company, shall not use the name or mark
of any post-Closing Affiliates of the Seller, or any abbreviation, variation
or derivative thereof, in any press release, public announcement or similar
public document or communication relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the express written consent of the Seller, other than
to the extent included in any Approved Release.

 



      
 

 



 

13.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall pay all of their
own expenses (including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses and, in
the case of the Company, the expenses of the Seller) in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that the Purchaser shall pay the Transaction Expenses as provided
in _Section 2.02(c)_.

 



 

13.04 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in

(b) when transmitted via facsimile machine or email to the number or email

not a Business Day then the next Business Day) on which the same has been
delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier service or (d)
the third Business Day following the day on which the same is sent by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid. Notices, demands and

13.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by (a) the Purchaser without the prior written consent
of, prior to the Closing, the Company or, after Closing, the Seller, or (b)
the Seller or the Company without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Purchaser may assign (without relieving
it of its obligations under) this Agreement or any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and (ii) following the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the
Company (A) may collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to any
lender providing financing to the Purchaser or, following the Closing, the
Company or any of its or Purchasers Subsidiaries and (B) may assign (without
relieving it of its obligations under) this Agreement or any rights, interests
or obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Person that acquires
(whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets, or otherwise), or
is the successor or surviving entity in any such acquisition, merger or other
transaction involving Purchaser, in each case, without such consent or any
further action on the part of either the Company or the Seller.

 



 

13.06 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, unless the severance of such provision would be in opposition
to the parties intent with respect to such provision.

 



 

13.07 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days (for the avoidance of
doubt, other than references to Business Days) or months shall be deemed
references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be deemed
references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires,
any reference to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or
"Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to an article of this Agreement, section
of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules
and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or any
variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. The phrase "ordinary course
of business" means "ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice." Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term
used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural
or singular form. With respect to any payment required to be made by Purchaser
under this Agreement, such payment may be caused to be paid by Purchaser
(whether through a paying agent or otherwise).

 



 

13.08 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged in separately titled sections and
subsections corresponding to the sections and subsections of this Agreement to
which the information disclosed in such section or subsection apply; however,
each section and subsection of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits is not intended to imply
that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or
other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such
amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
are within or outside of the ordinary course of business. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
Law or breach of contract). For purposes of this Agreement, a document shall
be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made available" (or any
phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the Company only if the Company
or a Person acting on its behalf posts a document to the online data room
hosted on behalf of the Company and located at
https://datasite.merrillcorp.com for "Project Cashew" in a manner accessible
and reviewable by Purchaser and its representatives at least two (2) days
prior to the date hereof. The parties hereto agree that any drafts of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement prior to the final fully executed drafts
shall not be used for purposes of interpreting any provision of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, and each of the parties hereto agree that no party
hereto shall make any claim, asset any defense or otherwise take any position
inconsistent with the foregoing in connection with any dispute or Proceeding
among any of the foregoing or for any other purpose.

 



 

13.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended, modified or waived
only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller. Any
such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given. No failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the

 



      
 

 



 

exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any amendment, modification or waiver of this _Section
13.09_ or _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_, _Section 13.11_, _Section
13.15_, _Section 13.16_, _Section 13.17_ or _Section 13.19_ that is adverse
to the Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall
not be made without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

13.10 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 



 

13.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. _Section 8.02_ shall be enforceable by
each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and representatives and Article
XI shall be enforceable by each Purchaser Indemnitee and each Seller
Indemnitee. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including, without
limitation, with respect to the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties, which shall be express third party beneficiaries of
and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions (solely as such provision
relates to such Debt Financing Sources and Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties in such capacity as third party beneficiary) of this _Section 13.11_
or _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_, Section _ 13.09_, _Section 13.15_,
_Section 13.16_, _Section 13.17_ or _Section 13.19_, nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

13.12 _Purchaser Deliveries_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered or made available to the Purchasers
Representatives shall be deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case
may be, to the Purchaser for all purposes hereunder to the extent posted to
the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and located at
https://datasite.merrillcorp.com for "Project Cashew" in a manner accessible
and reviewable by Purchaser and its representatives at least two (2) days
prior to the date hereof.

agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to

it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

 



 

13.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



       
 

 



 

13.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees for
themselves and, in the case of the Seller and the Company, on behalf of the
Seller Related Parties, that any claim or cause of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source or any Debt

appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any

been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section 13.04_

13.18 _Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are
expressly named as parties to this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, as
applicable. Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
of such parties set forth in this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, as
applicable, no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner, manager,
director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or representative of any party
to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or any Subsidiary of Company
will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or for any claim based upon, arising out

 



      
 

 



 

of or related to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 13.18, nothing in this Section 13.18
shall in any way limit or modify Purchasers rights under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or Purchasers rights with respect to any claims for
Fraud.

 



 

13.19 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that, subject to _Section
13.19(c)_, such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to
enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security).

 



 

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any Proceeding before any
Governmental Entity to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such action,
claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus five (5) Business Days,
or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, claim, complaint or other proceeding.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 13.19(a)_ or anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that none of the
Company, the Seller nor any other Person shall be entitled to any injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies to cause the Purchaser to
effect the Closing (or pay the Closing Cash Consideration) or to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter), except that the Seller shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies to enforce the
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter
and to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.01_, in each case,
only in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:
(i) all conditions in _Section 3.01_ have been satisfied at the time the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01_ but for the
failure of the Equity Financing to be funded (except for delivery of
certificates and other deliverables pursuant to _Section 3.01_, all of which
shall have been capable of being delivered on the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01_), (ii) the Purchaser is required to
complete the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.01_, (iii) the Debt Financing has
been funded or the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (iv) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed
in writing to the Purchaser that (A) all conditions in _Section 3.02_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) or will be waived by the Seller,
(B) the Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, and
(C) if specific performance is granted pursuant to this _Section 13.19(c)_
and the Financings are funded, then the Closing will occur, and (v) the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser has not consummated the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Seller be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically the Purchasers obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing if the Debt Financing has not
been funded and will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, while the
Seller may pursue both a grant of a decree or order of specific performance or
other equitable relief, as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this
_Section 13.19_, to enforce the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.01_ and the payment of the Termination Fee (only
to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 9.03_), under no circumstances
shall the Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) such grant of a
decree or order of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to effect the Closing and (ii) the payment
of the Termination Fee.

 



 

13.20 _Time is of the Essence_. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge and
agree that time is of the essence for each and every provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

13.21 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties agrees that subsequent to the
Closing, upon the reasonable request of any other party from time to time, it
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such further
instruments and take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to vest, perfect
or confirm ownership by the Purchaser of the Purchased Shares.
