          2.3. Payment for Shares. On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and
conditions herein contained, upon surrendering the certificates evidencing the
Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by duly executed assignments separate from
certificate (or an affidavit of lost certificate in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent), Parent shall cause Newco to pay to the Company
Shareholders, the Purchase Price as follows:

               (a) Cash to Shareholders. The Estimated Purchase Price (as
adjusted in accordance with Section 2.4), less the amount paid to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3(b) below, by wire transfer of immediately
available Federal funds to each Company Shareholder of an amount equal to such
Company Shareholder's proportionate share thereof based upon the respective
percentage ownership of the Shares as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (such
percentage ownership hereinafter referred to as such Company Shareholder's "Pro
Rata Share").

               (b) Cash to Escrow. Newco shall pay to the Escrow Agent Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the "Escrow Amount") by wire
transfer of immediately available Federal funds. The Escrow Amount shall be
held, invested and applied by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. Upon final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Escrow
Agent shall pay to the Company Shareholders One Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,500,000), less any claims made but not yet paid. Upon completion of
the investigation and remediation of the Environmental Action Items in
accordance with Section 9.7, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Company
Shareholders the remaining Escrow Amount, less any amount for claims made but
not yet paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Escrow Amount shall not constitute part of the Purchase Price
unless and until disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the Company Shareholders. For
all purposes, including without limitation financial reporting and income
taxation, the Escrow Amount shall constitute consideration for the purchase of
the Shares which is contingent upon disbursement to the Company Shareholders
from the Escrow Amount on the terms and conditions contained in the Escrow
Agreement.

         2.4. Estimated Balance Sheet; Closing Balance Sheet.
              ----------------------------------------------

               (a) Pre-Closing Deliveries. No less than five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent for
Parent's review and approval:

                    (i) a pro-forma balance sheet (the "Estimated Balance
Sheet") of the Company and the Subsidiaries which, except as set forth in
Section 2.4(j), shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent
with the Company's April 30, 2000 balance sheet;

                    (ii) a calculation of the Estimated Working Capital based on
the Estimated Balance Sheet; and

                    (iii) a calculation of the Estimated Net Indebtedness based
on the Estimated Balance Sheet.


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

               (b) Initial Purchase Price Adjustment. For purposes of Closing,
the Estimated Purchase Price will be adjusted if the Estimated Working Capital
is less than the Base Working Capital. If the Estimated Working Capital is less
than the Base Working Capital, then the Estimated Purchase Price will be
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficiency.

               (c) Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, the Shareholder Representative will cause the accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen, LLP to prepare a balance sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet") of the
Company as of the Closing Date and a calculation of the Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date based on the Closing Balance Sheet. Except
as set forth in Section 2.4(j), the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Working Capital and Net Indebtedness shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Company's April 30, 2000
balance sheet.

               (d) Bases for Objection. The only bases upon which Parent may
dispute any matter in the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the
Working Capital or Net Indebtedness are: (i) the inaccuracy of such matter,
whether factually or numerically; or (ii) the Closing Balance Sheet was not
prepared as provided in this Agreement.

               (e) Objection by Parent. The Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness shall be final and binding
upon the Parties unless Parent objects to any matter in the Closing Balance
Sheet or the calculation of the Working Capital or Net Indebtedness within
thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet by: (i)
notifying the Shareholder Representative in writing of such objection; and (ii)
providing the Shareholder Representative with a detailed statement describing
the basis for such objection along with Parent's calculation of the Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness. If the Shareholder Representative agrees with the
objection of the Parent, the Estimated Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.4(b) above, shall be further adjusted in the manner set forth in
Section 2.4(h) of this Agreement. If the Shareholder Representative does not
agree with the objection of Parent or with Parent's calculation of the Working
Capital or Net Indebtedness, the Shareholder Representative shall, within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the objection of Parent, notify the Parent in
writing of such fact. Shareholder Representative and Parent shall agree to
release from the Escrow any amount not in dispute pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

               (f) Independent Accountants. The Parties shall thereafter use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve the dispute; provided, that, if the
Parties are unable to resolve their dispute within thirty (30) days following
the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period described above, by notice of
Parent or the Shareholder Representative to the other, the disagreement between
the Parent and Shareholder Representative may then be submitted by either party
for resolution to the Chicago, Illinois office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP,
or to the Chicago, Illinois office of such other firm of independent certified
public accountants of national standing which has not provided substantial
services to Parent, the Company, Shareholder Representatives or any of their
affiliates and which firm is agreed to in writing by the Parent and Shareholder
Representative (the "Independent Accountants"). If the Parent and



                                      -8-
<PAGE>

the Shareholder Representative are unable to agree on the Independent
Accountants within ten (10) days after the receipt of such notice, the
Independent Accountants shall be the Chicago, Illinois office of a "Big 5"
accounting firm chosen by lot (after excluding any such firm that has provided
substantial services to the Parent, the Company, Shareholder Representatives or
any of their affiliates). The Parties agree to execute a reasonable engagement
letter if requested by the Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants
shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based on the provisions of this Section
2.4, only those matters in dispute. Within ten (10) business days after the
Independent Accountants have been retained, the Parties shall deliver to the
Independent Accountants and the other Party, such Party's position with respect
to each matter in dispute. Within five (5) business days after the expiration of
such ten (10) day period, each Party may deliver to the Independent Accountants
and the other Party such Party's response to the other Party's position on each
matter in dispute. With each submission, each party may also furnish to the
Independent Accountants such other information and documents as it deems
relevant or such documents or information that may be requested by the
Independent Accountants with appropriate copies or notification being given to
the other Party. The Independent Accountants may, at their discretion, conduct a
conference concerning the disagreement with Parent and Shareholder
Representative, at which conference each party shall have the right to present
additional documents, materials and other information and to have present its
advisors, counsel and accountants. In connection with such process, there shall
be no hearings, oral examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other
similar proceedings conducted by any party or by the Independent Accountants.

               (g) Decision. The Independent Accountants shall choose one of the
two positions on each disputed matter within forty-five (45) days after the
submissions provided for in subsection (e) above have been delivered to the
Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants determination as to each
item in dispute shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the
Parent and the Shareholder Representative and shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Independent Accountants shall determine the proportion of their
fees and expenses to be paid by each Parent and the Company Shareholders, based
primarily on the degree to which the Independent Accountants have accepted the
positions of the respective parties. Any portion of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountants which are the responsibility of the Company Shareholders
shall be included as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet.

               (h) Adjustments. The proposed Closing Balance Sheet and
calculation of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness shall be revised as
appropriate to reflect any agreement between the Parties with respect to the
Closing Balance Sheet or any decision of the Independent Accountants pursuant to
Section 2.4(f) and the Estimated Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

                    (i) In the event that the Working Capital based on the
Closing Balance Sheet as so revised is in excess of the Estimated Working
Capital, Parent shall pay such excess to Company Shareholders; provided,
however, Parent shall not be required to pay the Company Shareholders pursuant
to this subsection 2.4(h)(i) more than the amount by which the Purchase Price
was reduced pursuant to Section 2.4(b) above. In the event that the Estimated
Working Capital is in excess of the Working Capital based on the


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Closing Balance Sheet as so revised, the Company Shareholders shall pay such
excess to Parent.

                    (ii) In the event that the Net Indebtedness based on the
Closing Balance Sheet as so revised is in excess of the Estimated Net
Indebtedness, the Company Shareholders shall pay such excess to Parent. In the
event that the Estimated Net Indebtedness is less than the Net Indebtedness
based on the Closing Balance Sheet as so revised, Parent shall pay such excess
to the Company Shareholders.

                    (iii) Any amounts owing to Parent pursuant to this Section
2.4(h) shall be paid from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. In the event that the amount to be paid to Parent pursuant to
this Section 2.4(h) exceeds the Escrow Amount, the Indemnifying Shareholders
shall wire to Parent in immediately available Federal funds such excess. In the
event that the Company Shareholders are entitled to a payment pursuant to this
Section 2.4(h), Parent shall pay the Company Shareholders the amount of such
payment and the Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to the Company Shareholders.

               (i) Payment. Any payment pursuant to Section 2.4(h) of this
Agreement shall be made within three (3) business days after an agreement
between the Parties with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or any decision of
the Independent Accountants pursuant to Section 2.4(f) and shall include
interest on the amount due from the Closing Date to and including the date paid
in full at an annual interest rate equal to 7.5% rate of interest. Any payment
to the Company Shareholders shall be made by wire transfer to such account as
may be designated by the Shareholder Representative who shall be responsible to
disburse such amount to the Company Shareholders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share.

               (j) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing

net amount of such liability after taking into account the benefit of such
deduction shall be included as a liability:

<PAGE>

                    (vi) shall reflect an increase in certain reserves
designated by Parent in a dollar amount equal to the product of (A) Thirty-Two

assets' aggregate adjusted tax basis), times (B) .23 (the "Allocation
Adjustment"); provided that (x) the Allocation Adjustment shall be reduced by
the product of (the aggregate Purchase Price allocated to Buildings less such

the extent such Difference results in Section 1250 of the Code recapture to the
Company Shareholders; and (y) the Allocation Adjustment amount shall be in
addition to any increases/decreases in the reserves determined in accordance
with subsection 2.4(j)(i) above. To the extent that the parties make a Section

Purchase Price to assets of Leeson Canada Inc. in excess of such assets'

Shareholders that results in taxes computed at rates in excess of the applicable
capital gains rates (less applicable tax credits), the Parties agree to
equitably adjust the Allocation Adjustment to offset such difference.

               (k)  Cooperation.

                    (i) The Shareholder Representative will make the work papers

reasonable times and upon reasonable notice at any time during (A) the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, (B) the review by Parent of the
Closing Balance Sheet, and (C) the resolution by the Parent and the Shareholder
Representative of any objections to the Closing Balance Sheet.

                    (ii) Parent will, and will cause the Company to, make the
work papers and back-up materials used in (or necessary for) the Closing Balance
Sheet, and any books, records and financial staff of Parent and the Company and
their accountants and other representatives, available to the Shareholder
Representative and Arthur Andersen, LLP and their other representatives and to
the Independent Accountants resolving any claim concerning the Closing Balance
Sheet at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice at any time during (A) the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, (B) the review by the Shareholder
Representative of Parent's objections to the Closing Balance Sheet, and (C) the

                                  ARTICLE III

          6.7.  Disclosure Schedule.
                -------------------

               (a) Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company Shareholders are delivering to Parent the Disclosure
Schedule, which is accompanied by a certificate signed by the Shareholder
Representative stating that the Disclosure Schedule is being delivered pursuant
to this Agreement and is the Disclosure Schedule referred to in this Agreement.
The Disclosure Schedule is deemed to constitute an integral part of this
Agreement and to modify the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
of the Company and Company Shareholders contained in this Agreement. The
inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an
indication of the materiality or lack of materiality of such item. The Company
and Company Shareholders shall use reasonable efforts to number all exceptions
noted in the Disclosure Schedule to correspond to the applicable section of this
Agreement to which such exception refers, however, an item enclosed in one
section of the Disclosure Schedule which is relative to another section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in such other section, but only if
a person reading such item would reasonably conclude that such an item is
relative to the other section.

               (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company may amend, update or
supplement the Disclosure Schedule (an "Updated Disclosure") from time to time
by written notice to Parent. If requested by Parent, the Shareholder
Representative shall meet and discuss with Parent any change in the Disclosure
Schedule made by the Shareholder Representative. For purposes of determining the
fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 as of the Closing, the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to include all information contained in any
supplement or amendment thereto made on or before the Closing. For purposes of
determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
Article III or Article IV and the liability of Indemnifying Shareholders or
Company Shareholders with respect thereto under Article IX, the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on
the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information
contained in any Updated Disclosure.

          6.8. Releases and Resignations.
               -------------------------

               (a) Releases. At the Closing, each Company Shareholder shall
deliver, and shall cause Frank Poja, David Spude and Ronald Clarke ("SAR
Participants") to deliver, general releases to the Company, in substantially the
form of Exhibit F hereto, releasing the Company and the directors, officers,
agents and employees of the Company from all claims to the Closing Date and for
any severance or termination benefits resulting from termination, if any,
post-Closing, except (i) as may be described in written contracts attached to
the release and excepted from such releases, (ii) compensation for the period
through Closing and excepted from such releases, and (iii) this Agreement and
Ancillary Documents. At the Closing, Buying Group shall deliver to Company
Shareholders and directors a release in substantially the form of Exhibit F
hereto.

               (b) Resignations. At the Closing, each Company Shareholder who is
an employee, officer or director of the Company, SAR Participants and each
director of the Company shall, if requested by Parent, tender their resignations
or confirm their retirement

from such resignations or retirement, if any, shall be the obligation of Company
Shareholders.

          6.9. Subsidiary Stock. Immediately prior to the Closing, each Company
Shareholder shall contribute his/her/its capital stock of each Subsidiary to the

anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall not take, nor permit the Company
or Newco to take, any action so as to amend the provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries providing for
indemnification of directors and officers, if such amendment would adversely
affect the rights of any person who shall have served as a director or officer
of Company or any of the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. This covenant of
Parent may be enforced after the Closing Date by the Shareholder Representative
on behalf of any person whose rights are adversely affected by any such
amendment. After the Closing, the Company shall indemnify the former officers
and directors of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
provided that indemnification owing from any Indemnifying Shareholder under
Article IX of this Agreement who is an officer or director of the Company shall
not be deemed for any reason to be a claim covered by indemnification owing to
such Company Shareholder by the Company under any law, by-law, insurance policy
or agreement whatsoever.

          6.11. Shareholder Representative. By signing this Agreement, the
Company Shareholders hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint Christopher
L. Doerr and Daniel L. Doerr as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact to take
all actions required under this Agreement on behalf of the Company Shareholders
(including, without limitation, the resolution or dispute of any claims) in
their name and stead and further ratify and approve all such actions as their
own. So long as there is more than one Shareholder Representatives, the
Shareholder Representatives may only act by agreement of both Shareholder
Representatives. In the event of the death, inability to act or declination to
act of either Christopher L. Doerr or Daniel L. Doerr, then the other shall act
as the Shareholder Representative hereunder as if there were only one
Shareholder Representative. In the event of the death, inability to act or
declination to act of both Christopher L. Doerr and Daniel L. Doerr, then a
successor Shareholder Representative shall be selected by the Company
Shareholders owning a majority of the Common Stock as of the Closing Date.

          6.12. Employee Matters. Except as provided in Section 6.8, for a
period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent and Newco shall
cause the Company to maintain welfare and pension benefit plans, programs and
arrangements which are, in the aggregate, for the employees who are employees of
the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and continue to be employees
after the Closing Date, no less favorable, taken as a whole, then those provided
by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date.

               (a) After the Closing and for a period of six (6) years, the

<PAGE>

          6.17. Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility for certain Tax matters and the payment of Taxes
following the date of this Agreement.

               (a)  Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date.

                    (i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Company Shareholders shall file, or cause Company and each Subsidiary to file,
on a timely basis all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by Company and
each Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions of
time to file) and pay or cause Company to pay all Taxes due and owing thereon.
No position shall be taken on such Tax Returns that would materially adversely
affect Parent, Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date without the
written consent of Parent.

                    (ii) Except as set forth in subsection 6.17(a)(iii) below,
Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date historically
filed by the Company and each Subsidiary in a manner consistent with the Tax
Returns previously filed in the relevant jurisdiction (to the extent such is
consistent with the current applicable laws in such jurisdiction). Company
Shareholders shall reimburse Parent for Taxes of Company and each Subsidiary
with respect to such periods within three (3) days after payment by Parent,
Company or Subsidiary of such Taxes to the extent such Taxes are not reflected
in the reserve for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of
the Closing Balance Sheet.

                    (iii) Company Shareholders shall pay all federal, state, and
local income or franchise Taxes accruing on or before the Closing Date. Company
Shareholders shall cause to be prepared and timely and properly filed on behalf
of Company Shareholders and Company all returns and filings with respect to
federal, Wisconsin and other state income or franchise taxes accruing on or
before the Closing Date. Company Shareholders shall prepare such returns and
filings at their expense. No position shall be taken on such Tax Returns that
would materially adversely affect Parent, Company or any Subsidiary after the
Closing Date without the written consent of Parent.

                    (iv) All Tax Returns shall be determined by closing
Company's and Subsidiary's books and records as of and including the Closing
Date, or if the allocation of an item of income, loss, deduction or credit
cannot be definitely allocated to an ascertainable date, such item shall be pro
rated on a daily basis. Company Shareholders and Company agree that they each
shall consent to the election pursuant to Code Section 1377(a)(2) (and any state
equivalent election) with respect to all transfers of ownership during Company's
current tax year. Company Shareholders shall obtain the consent to such
elections from each person who owned stock at any time during its current
taxable year on or prior to Closing and shall cause Company to timely and
properly file such elections.

               (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

returns of Company and each Subsidiary for Tax periods which begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. Parent shall deliver any such Tax
Return prepared by Parent to the Company Representative for the Company
Representative's review and approval at least fifteen (15) days before such Tax
Return is due. Company Shareholders shall pay to Parent within three (3) days
after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount
equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in
the reserve for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the
Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (x)
in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Company.

               (c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority
and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,

338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares to
treat such purchase and sale as a deemed sale of assets for federal income tax
and state income and/or franchise tax purposes, and, at Parent's request, a

Forms (as hereinafter defined) to the extent such preparation has not been
completed prior to the Closing and shall timely make any required filings and
take any and all other actions necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Each Company Shareholder shall include in his Federal income tax
return for the taxable period which includes the Closing Date any Section 338
Forms that are required to be so included on account of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. The Company Shareholders and the Parent shall cooperate fully, and in
good faith, with each other in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election. "Section
338 Forms" shall include, without limitation, any "statement of section 338
election" and IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form, together with any schedules
or attachments thereto) that are required pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section
1.338-1 or Treas. Reg. Section 1.338(h)(10)-1.

               (f) Allocation of Purchase Price. In the event one or more

                          INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

          9.1. Survival; Remedies for Breach.
               -----------------------------

               (a) Each and every representation and warranty made by the
Indemnifying Shareholders, the Company Shareholders, Parent or Newco in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, but shall terminate on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and thereafter be of no further force
or effect (the date on which any representation or warranty terminates in
accordance with this Article IX being referred to herein as the "Cut-off Date"
for such representation or warranty); except:

                    (i) there shall be no Cut-Off Date for the representations
and warranties of the Company Shareholders contained in Article IV;

                    (ii) the Cut-Off Date for representations and warranties of
Company Shareholders contained in Section 3.17 shall be five (5) years after the
Closing Date; and

                    (iii) the Cut-Off Date for representations and warranties of

statute of limitations relating to Tax subject to indemnification expires.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

               (b) Any covenant or agreement contained herein or in the
Ancillary Instruments shall survive the Closing Date.

               (c) Any representation or warranty that would otherwise terminate
at the Cut-off Date with respect thereto shall survive if the notice referred to
in Section 9.2(c) or Section 9.3(b), as the case may be, of the breach or
inaccuracy thereof shall have been given on or prior to the Cut-off Date with
respect thereto to the party against whom indemnification may be sought, and
such shall survive until such time as any claim for indemnification is finally
settled in accordance with the terms hereof.

               (d) The indemnification obligation of Indemnifying Shareholders
contained in Section 9.7(a)(i) hereof terminates on the date that is seven (7)
years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indemnifying
Shareholders may, at their expense, substitute Environmental Insurance for its
obligations to provide indemnification under Section 9.7(a)(i) in years six(6)
and seven (7).

               (e) After the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this Article
IX shall be the exclusive remedies of the Company Shareholders, Company, Parent
and Newco for the breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
in this Agreement by the Company Shareholders, Company, Parent and Newco, as the
case may be, and the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature
whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the Parties waive. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions and
restrictions of the Noncompetition Agreements are necessary to protect the
legitimate continuing interests of Buying Group in acquiring the Shares and that
any violation or breach of any provision of those agreements will result in
irreparable injury to the Buying Group and Company for which a remedy at law
would be inadequate and that, in addition to any relief at law which may be
available to Buying Group and Company for such violation or breach, and
regardless of any other provision contained in this Article IX, Buying Group and
Company shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief as a court
may grant after considering the intent of this Agreement and the Noncompetition
Agreements.

          9.2. Indemnification on Behalf of Indemnifying Shareholders and
Company Shareholders.

               (a) Indemnifying Shareholders. To induce Parent and Newco to
enter into this Agreement and to purchase the Shares, the Indemnifying
Shareholders hereby agree to, subject to the provisions of this Section and the
other Sections of this Article IX, severally, but not jointly, and in accordance
with the percentages listed on the Disclosure Schedule, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buying Group from and against, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained or suffered by, or imposed upon, with respect to or by reason of:

                    (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the
Indemnifying Shareholders contained in Article III of this Agreement;


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

                    (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company
Shareholders set forth herein;

                    (iii) Taxes for any taxable period which ends on or prior to
the Closing Date or resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, as a result of any Section 338(h)(10) Election),
to the extent such Tax is not adequately reserved for on the Closing Balance
Sheet.

               (b) Company Shareholders. To induce Parent and Newco to enter
into this Agreement and to purchase the Shares, each Company Shareholder agrees
to, subject to the provisions of this Section and the other Sections of this
Article IX, individually indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buying Group
from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained or suffered by, or
imposed upon, with respect to or by reason of the breach of any representation
or warranty made by such Company Shareholder contained in Article IV of this
Agreement;

                    For purposes of this Article IX, the term "Buying Group"
shall include all of the Buying Group's directors, officers, employees and
controlled or controlling persons.

               (c) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Buying Group shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b):

                    (i) with respect to a claim for indemnification hereunder
related to the title of Real Estate with respect to which there is a title
insurance policy in effect, except to the extent the Buying Group has first
unsuccessfully attempted to recover upon such title insurance;

                    (ii) to the extent of the value of any net tax benefit
actually realized (by reason of a tax deduction, basis reduction, shifting of
income, credit, deduction or otherwise) by the Buying Group or the Company in
connection with the Loss that forms the basis of Buying Group's claim for
indemnification hereunder taking into account the tax detriment of any recovery
or anticipated recovery on the Buying Group's claim for indemnification;

                    (iii) with respect to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, unless Buying Group has given the Shareholder Representative written
notice of such claim, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances pertaining thereto, (A) as soon as practicable following Parent's
discovery of such claim, but only to the extent such delay actually prejudices
the Indemnifying Shareholders and (B) prior to the applicable Cut-Off Date;

                    (iv) to the extent of any insurance proceeds received by the
Buying Group in connection with the facts giving rise to such indemnification
(and the Buying Group shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies
covering any Losses to the same extent as they would if such Losses were not
subject to indemnification under this Agreement);


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

                    (v) with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty
for a single course of conduct, related set of circumstances, occurrence or
event unless the Losses suffered by the Buying Group arising therefrom from such
breach of the representation or warranty exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000), and, in such event, Buying Group shall be entitled to indemnification
in full for the total loss with respect to such claim subject to the limitation
contained in this Section 9.2(b)(v);

                    (vi) for any Losses for the breaches of representations or
warranties in Article III as to which the Buying Group otherwise may be entitled
to indemnification hereunder (without giving effect to this clause (vi)), until
such Losses exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and then only for such
Losses in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); and

                    (vii) for any Losses in excess of Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000) (over and above the One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in Losses
which are the obligation of the Buying Group pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(vi)
above), all such Losses in excess of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) being
the responsibility of the Buying Group.

               (d) Exceptions to Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
limitations contained in Section 9.2(c)(vi) and (vii) shall not apply to
indemnification obligations relating to (A) any breach of a Company Shareholder
representation or warranty regarding the Shares or the shares of Leeson Canada
Inc. under Article IV which shall solely be the responsibility of the applicable
Company Shareholder, (B) any breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.6(f) hereof, (C) any breach of a representation or
warranty resulting from an Updated Disclosure (other than non-liability breaches
consented to by Parent) of which Company had Knowledge of such breach as of the
date of this Agreement; or (D) the separate indemnification provided in Section
9.7(a), for which limitations on such indemnification are contained in Section
9.7(e).

               (e) Noncompetition Agreements. Each Indemnifying Shareholder
shall be solely responsible for a breach of his respective Noncompetition
Agreement,

          9.3. Indemnification by Parent.
               -------------------------

               (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section and the other
Sections of this Article IX, Parent agrees to indemnify the Company and the
Company Shareholders and hold them harmless (and agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless any persons adversely affected by Parent's failure to comply with
Section 6.10 of this Agreement) from and against any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by or imposed upon the Company or the Company Shareholders (or such
persons) with respect to or by reason of any failure, breach, default,
inaccuracy or lack of performance on the part of Parent or Newco of any of their
respective representations, warranties, agreements or covenants under this
Agreement.

               (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company Shareholders (and such persons) shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.3(a) with respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder unless the Shareholder Representative has given Parent
written notice of such claim, setting forth in reasonable detail


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto, (i) as soon as practicable

prior to the applicable Cut-off Date.

          9.4. Indemnification by Company. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article IX and until the Closing, the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buying Group from and against all Losses
asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon or incurred by Buying Group,
arising out of or resulting from:

               (a) the breach of any of the representations or warranties
contained in Article III of this Agreement, or

               (b) the failure of the Company or Company Shareholders to comply
with any of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement which were
required to be performed by the Company or any Company Shareholder.

          9.5. Procedures for Indemnification.
               ------------------------------

               (a) If an Indemnified Party shall claim to have suffered a Loss
for which indemnification is available under Section 9.2 or 9.3, as the case may
be (for purposes of this Section 9.5, regardless of whether such Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive a payment in respect of such claim by virtue of
paragraph (b) of Section 9.2), the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim within the time periods provided
herein, which written notice shall describe the nature of such claim, the facts
and circumstances that give rise to such claim and the amount of such claim if
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made (or if not then
reasonably ascertainable, the maximum amount of such claim reasonably estimated
by the Indemnified Party). In the event that within forty-five (45) days after
the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such a written notice from the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall not have received from the
Indemnifying Party a written objection to such claim, such claim shall be
conclusively presumed and considered to have been assented to and approved by
the Indemnifying Party following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a written
notice from the Indemnified Party to such effect.

               (b) If within the forty-five (45) day period described in
paragraph (a) above the Indemnified Party shall have received from the
Indemnifying Party a notice setting forth the Indemnifying Party's objections to
such claim and the Indemnifying Party's reasons for such objection, then the
Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Article XI below with respect
to the resolution of such matter.

          9.6. Procedures for Third-Party Claim.
               --------------------------------

               (a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to
this Article IX in respect of any Third-Party Claim shall give the Indemnifying
Party from whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought (i) prompt
written notice of such Third-Party Claim and (ii) copies of all documents and
information relating to any such Third-Party Claim promptly after their being
obtained by the Indemnified Party; provided, that


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

the failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify or provide copies to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
to the Indemnified Party for any liability hereunder except to the extent that
such failure shall have prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

               (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option,
and expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third-Party Claim with respect to which it is the Indemnifying Party and to be
represented by counsel of its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will not
admit any liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge
the same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, so long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting or
defending the same with reasonable diligence and in good faith; provided, that
the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense; provided further, that the Indemnifying Party may not
enter into a settlement of any such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall be not unreasonably withheld, unless such
settlement requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified
Party is fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or involves other matters
not binding upon the Indemnified Party; and provided further that, in the event
the Indemnifying Party does not, within fifteen (15) days after it receives
written notice of the Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party, agree in
writing to accept the defense of, and assume all responsibility for, such
Third-Party Claim as provided above in this Section 9.6(b), then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with the Third-Party Claim in such manner as the Indemnified Party deems
appropriate, in its sole discretion, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification therefor from the Indemnifying Party to the extent provided
under this Article IX.

          9.7. Environmental Matters.
               ---------------------

               (a) Separate Indemnification. Without limiting the generality of
the indemnification provided in Section 9.2, the Indemnifying Shareholders
hereby agree to severally, but not jointly, and in accordance with the
percentages listed on the Disclosure Schedule, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buying Group from and against any Losses asserted against, imposed on,
or incurred by the Buying Group, directly or indirectly, in connection with or
by reason of (i) (A) the Company's purchase of assets and assumption of
liabilities and leases from the Sandor Corporation or Sandor CA, Inc. relating
to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, (B) the occupancy by the Company
of any property or premises in Sedalia, Missouri prior to the Closing Date
relating to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substance, (C) the transportation,
handling, storage, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Substances at or from the
Sedalia, Missouri properties or premises prior to the Closing Date by the
Company, or (D) the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.17 as it relates solely to the properties and premises in
Sedalia, Missouri, or (ii) the matters identified during the environmental
investigations (Phase I (but only to the extent identified in the
"recommendations" Section of such Phase I report and excluding Phase I
assessments of the Sedalia properties) and Phase II site assessments and
compliance audits) prior to Closing conducted by Company, Parent or their
consultants or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule which require investigation
or remediation of, or to bring


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

into compliance, the Company, its businesses, facilities and assets pursuant to
all Environmental Laws (the "Environmental Action Items").

               (b) Remediation. The Indemnifying Shareholders shall cause the
Company to investigate and remedy the Environmental Action Items prior to
Closing or, to the extent such investigation or remedy is not effected prior to
Closing and the cost thereof is not reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet,
shall pay or reimburse the Company for payment of the cost of effecting such
remedy after the Closing.

               (c) Access and Assistance. With regard to any matter for which
the Indemnifying Shareholders have an indemnification obligation under Section
9.2(a) as a result of a breach of a representation and warranty contained in
Section 3.17 hereof or under Section 9.7(a), and for which a claim has been
asserted as provided in Section 9.5 or Section 9.6 above (the "Environmental
Claims"):

                    (i) Company Shareholders and Buying Group acknowledge and
agree that the Company shall retain responsibility for the management of the
investigation, removal, closure and/or clean-up relating to the environmental
claims ("Investigation and Remediation"), but shall consult with Shareholder
Representative and Shareholder Representative's counsel as the Investigation and
Remediation plans are developed, and Buying Group shall consider in the plan
development all proposals made by Shareholder Representative. Buying Group shall
obtain the consent of Shareholder Representative for any Investigation and
Remediation action, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Company agrees that during the course of the Investigation and Remediation, it
will obtain competitive bids for any required Investigation or Remediation
services and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the cost of
the Investigation and Remediation as long as the Investigation and Remediation
is completed in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws in effect at the
time conducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to
accept institutional controls as part of any Investigation and Remediation
action.

                    (ii) Buying Group shall (A) provide the Shareholder
Representative and its agents and representatives reasonable access to the
relevant real estate (but only to the extent that the Buying Group has a right
to provide such access) to conduct its own investigation or testing with regards
to the matter; provided, however, that the Shareholder Representative and its
agents and representatives shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations
on the real estate and shall restore such real estate to the condition existing
prior to the investigation and testing activities and the Indemnifying
Shareholders shall provide to the Buying Group, copies of all sampling data
obtained on behalf of the Indemnifying Shareholders or in the possession or
control of the Indemnifying Shareholders; (B) provide the Shareholder
Representative with the results, including analytical data, of any investigation
or testing conducted by the Buying Group or, if available to the Buying Group,
any third party; (C) give the Shareholder Representative and its agents and
representatives a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussion or
negotiation with any governmental authority concerning such matter; (D) cause
its employees to cooperate with the Shareholder Representative and to afford the
Shareholder Representative, its agents and representatives access to relevant
records relating to the matters which may be the Indemnifying Shareholders'


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

responsibility under this Agreement; and (E) provide Shareholder Representative
and Shareholder Representative's counsel with complete copies of all drafts and
final reports, bids, notices, correspondence and other communications with any
governmental or regulatory authority concerning such matter.

               (d) Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of determining whether and
to the extent to which Buying Group is able to seek indemnification from the
Indemnifying Shareholders under Sections 9.2 or 9.7(a)(i)(D), for the inaccuracy
or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.17, the
language "Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17" shall be disregarded and the
information set forth in Schedule 3.17 shall be deemed not to have been
disclosed to the Buying Group. The parties acknowledge that the sole purpose of
including such schedule in the Disclosure Schedules is to determine whether the
condition set forth in Section 7.1 has been met by the Company Shareholders for
purposes of Closing.

               (e) Limitations on Separate Indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 9.2, the indemnification obligations of
Indemnifying Shareholders under this Section 9.7 shall be subject to the
following limitations only:

                    (i) There shall be no deductible or basket for
indemnification of Losses relating to the Environmental Action Items;

                    (ii) Buying Group shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 9.7(a)(i) unless the aggregate of the Indemnifying Shareholders'
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 9.7(a)(i) (but for this Section
9.7(e)(ii)) exceeds One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000), and
then only for those Losses in excess of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars
($125,000)); and

                    (iii) Except for the limitations contained in Section 9.2(d)
which shall apply to all indemnification claims, Indemnifying Shareholders'
indemnification obligations under Sections 9.2 and 9.7 shall not exceed Twenty
Million Dollars ($20,000,000).

               (f) Sedalia Properties. Buying Group agrees to vacate the two
Sedalia properties no later than August 1, 2001.

          9.8. Material Qualifiers. For purposes of determining whether and to
the extent to which Buying Group is able to seek indemnification from the
Indemnifying Shareholders under Section 9.2 for the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty, the use of the term "material" as a qualifier in any
such representation or warranty, except as used in connection with "Material
Contract" or "material adverse change," shall be disregarded, and all claims for
such indemnification shall be determined as if the term "material" was not
present in such representation or warranty.

          9.9. Subrogation. In the event the Indemnified Party incurs any Losses
for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party shall, upon


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

payment of any such Losses to the Indemnified Party, be subrogated to the rights
of any claims the Indemnified Party or the Company may have against any third
party.

Representative in writing and the Closing has not occurred by October 15, 2000
or the date of such notice, whichever is later; or

                    (ii) the Closing has not occurred by October 15, 2000, for
reasons other than the failure of the Company or Company Shareholders to perform
their obligations hereunder.

          10.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of a termination of this
Agreement by Parent or the Shareholder Representative under subsections
10.1(b)(i) or 10.1(c)(i), the Parties shall have such rights and remedies in law

pursuant to Sections 6.1(b), 6.5, 10.2, 12.2, 12.3, 12.5, 12.6 and Articles IX
and XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

          10.3. Right to Proceed. If any of the conditions specified in Article
VII hereof have not been satisfied, Parent and Newco, in lieu of any other
rights that may be available to them, may waive their rights to have such
conditions satisfied prior to Closing and may proceed with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and if any of the conditions specified in Article VII
hereof have not been satisfied prior to Closing, the Shareholder Representative,

                                   ARTICLE XI
                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION

          11.1. Dispute. As used in this Agreement, "Dispute" shall mean any
dispute or disagreement between Parent (for itself or on behalf of Newco) and
Company or the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of Company Shareholders)
concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, the validity of this Agreement,
any breach or alleged breach by any party under this Agreement or any other
matter relating in any way to this Agreement, except for a dispute or
disagreement relating to the Closing Balance Sheet, which shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Agreement and the Noncompetition Agreements,
which shall be resolved in accordance with their terms.

          11.2. Process. If a Dispute arises, the parties to the Dispute shall
follow the procedures specified in Sections 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5 of this
Agreement.

          11.3. Negotiations. The parties shall promptly attempt to resolve any
Dispute by negotiations between the Parent and the Shareholder Representative.
Either the Parent or Shareholder Representative may give the other Party written
notice of any Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. The Parent
and the Shareholder Representative shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and
place within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of such notice, and
thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant
information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute has not been
resolved by these Persons within thirty (30) calendar days of the disputing
party's notice, or if the Parties fail to meet within such ten (10) calendar
days, either the Parent or the Shareholder Representative may initiate mediation
as provided in Section 11.4 of this Agreement. If a negotiator intends to be
accompanied at a meeting by legal counsel, the other negotiator shall be given
at least three (3) business days' notice of such intention and may also be
accompanied by legal counsel.

          11.4. Mediation. If the Dispute is not resolved by negotiations
pursuant to Section 11.3 of this Agreement, the Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such Dispute by
mediation. Either the Parent or the Shareholder Representative may initiate a
mediation proceeding by a request in writing to the other party (the "Request"),
and both parties will then be obligated to engage in a mediation. The proceeding
will be conducted in accordance with the then current Center for Public
Resources ("CPR") Model Procedure for Mediation of Business Disputes, with the
following exceptions:

               (a) if the Parties have not agreed within thirty (30) calendar
days of the Request on the selection of a mediator willing to serve, CPR, upon
the request of either the Parent or the Shareholder Representative, shall
appoint a member of the CPR Panels of Neutrals as the mediator; and

               (b) efforts to reach a settlement will continue until the
conclusion of the proceedings, which shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest
of the date that: (i) a


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

written settlement is reached; or (ii) the mediator concludes and informs the
Parties in writing that further efforts would not be useful; or (iii) the Parent
and the Shareholder Representative agree in writing that an impasse has been
reached; or (iv) is sixty (60) calendar days after the Request and none of the
events specified in Sections 11.4(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) have occurred. No Party
may withdraw before the conclusion of the proceeding.

          11.5. Submission to Adjudication. If a Dispute is not resolved by
negotiation pursuant to Section 11.3 of this Agreement or by mediation pursuant
to Section 11.4 of this Agreement within 100 calendar days after initiation of
the negotiation process pursuant to Section 11.3 of this Agreement, such Dispute
and any other claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be heard,
adjudicated and determined in an action or proceeding filed in any state court
sitting in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin or in any federal court sitting in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

          11.6. General.
                -------

               (a) Provisional Remedies. At any time during the procedures
specified in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 of this Agreement, a party may seek a
preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in its judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status
quo. Despite such action, the parties will continue to participate in good faith
in the procedures specified in this Article XI of this Agreement.

               (b) Tolling Statue of Limitations. All applicable statutes of
limitation and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled while the
procedures specified in this Article XI of this Agreement are pending. The
Parties will take such action, if any, as is required to effectuate such
tolling.

               (c) Performance to Continue. Each Party is required to continue
to perform its obligations under this Agreement pending final resolution of any
Dispute.

               (d) Extension of Deadlines. All deadlines specified in this
Article XI of this Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement between the
Parent and the Shareholder Representative.

               (e) Enforcement. The parties regard the obligations in this
Article XI of this Agreement to constitute an essential provision of this
Agreement and one that is legally binding on them. In case of a violation of the
obligations in this Article XI of this Agreement by either the Parent or the
Shareholder Representative, the other party may bring an action to seek
enforcement of such obligations in any court of Law having jurisdiction thereof.

               (f) Costs. The parties to the dispute shall pay: (i) their own
costs, fees, and expenses incurred in connection with the application of the
provisions of this Article X of this Agreement; and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of
the fees and expenses of CPR and the mediator in connection with the application
of the provisions of Section 11.4 of this Agreement; provided that, prior to the
Closing, the Shareholder Representative's costs, fees


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and after the Closing, the
Shareholder Representative's costs, fees and expenses shall be paid by the
Company Shareholders.

               (g) Replacement. If CPR is no longer in business or is unable or
refuses or declines to act or to continue to act under this Article XI of this
Agreement for any reason, then the functions specified in this Article XI of
this Agreement to be performed by CPR shall be performed by another Person
engaged in a business equivalent to that conducted by CPR as is agreed to by the
Parent and the Shareholder Representative (the "Replacement"). If the Parent and
the Shareholder Representative cannot agree on the identity of the Replacement
within ten (10) calendar days after a Request, the Replacement shall be selected
by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Wisconsin upon application by any party hereto. If a Replacement is selected
by either means, this Article XI shall be deemed appropriately amended to refer
to such Replacement.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          12.1. Further Assurance. From time to time, at a Party's request and
without further consideration, the other Parties will execute and deliver to the
requesting Party such documents and take such other action as the requesting
Party may reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          12.2. Assignment; Binding Effect.
                --------------------------

               (a) The rights and obligations of a Party hereunder may not be
assigned, transferred or encumbered without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided, however, that Parent and Newco may assign their rights
and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of their wholly-owned
subsidiaries, but such assignment shall not relieve either Parent or Newco of
its obligations hereunder.

               (b) Subject to Section 12.2(a) above, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement is not intended to
confer upon any person other than Parent, Newco, Company Shareholders and the
Company any rights or remedies hereunder.

          12.3. Law Governing Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted according to the internal Laws of the State of Wisconsin, excluding
any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

          12.4. Amendment and Modification. Parent, Newco, Company and
Shareholder Representative may amend, modify and supplement this Agreement, and
any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof
may be waived, only by a written instrument executed on behalf of Parent, Newco,
Company and the Shareholder Representative.

                  ELECTRIC CORPORATION, AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
                           LESSON ELECTRIC CORPORATION


          THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "First
Amendment") is made and entered into as of this 29th day of September, 2000, by
and between REGAL-BELOIT CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation ("Parent"), LEC
ACQUISITION COP., a Wisconsin corporation ("Newco"), LEESON ELECTRIC

among Parent, Newco, the Company and Shareholders dated August 7, 2000 (the
"Agreement").

          WHEREAS, the parties disagree as to whether the makewhole premium with
respect to the repayment of the indebtedness under that certain Note Purchase
Agreement dated as of May 15, 1996 (as amended, the "Note Agreement") by and
between the Company and State of Wisconsin Investment Board ("SWIB") and that
certain 7.19% Senior Note dated May 15, 1996 (the "Note") executed by the
Company and payable to SWIB, should be included in the definition of "Net
Indebtedness" and "Estimated Net Indebtedness" for purposes of calculating the
Purchase Price.

          WHEREAS, the parties have agreed to resolve this dispute as set forth
below.

          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the
mutual covenants and conditions herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

     1. Section 2.4(i) shall be added to the Agreement to read in its entirety
as follows:

          (i) SWIB Makewhole Premium. Pursuant to a pay-off letter dated
September 21, 2000, the makewhole premium is $446,901.09. In compromise of the
dispute, the Working Capital (as defined in the Agreement) shall be reduced by
$134,070.

     2. On behalf of the Buying Group (as defined in the Agreement), Parent and
Newco hereby waive any breach of any representation or warranty within the
Agreement made by the Indemnifying Shareholders relating to any breach or
default of the Note Agreement resulting from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

     3. Except as modified by this First Amendment, the Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.

<PAGE>

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this First Amendment to
