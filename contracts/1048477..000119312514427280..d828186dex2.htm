 _ARTICLE 2_

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 2.01. _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred that would give rise to a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, as promptly as 

 



11  practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than the later of
(A) fifteen Business Days following the date of this Agreement and (B) five
Business Days following the date of satisfaction or waiver by Buyer and the
Company of the condition set forth under Part 1 of Annex I hereto (the "Pre-
Launch Condition"), Buyer shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the 1934 Act) the Offer. The Pre-Launch Condition is for the benefit of
both Buyer and the Company and may be waived only by the Company and Buyer
jointly (either in whole or in part) by written agreement. No party may invoke
the Pre-Launch Condition if the non-satisfaction of such condition is caused
by a breach of that party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The
obligations of Buyer to, and of Parent to cause Buyer to, accept for payment,
and pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of
the conditions set forth in Part 2 of Annex I hereto (the "Offer Conditions").
The date on which Buyer commences the Offer is referred to as the "Offer
Commencement Date".

__(b) Buyer expressly reserves the right at any time to, its sole discretion,
waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change
in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided_ that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Buyer shall not: __

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I);

 

(ii) decrease the Offer Consideration;

 

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 

(v) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement; or

 

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of the Shares.

(c) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty Business Days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the
Offer Commencement Date (such time, the "Initial Expiration Time" or such
time and any subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Time").
Subject to the provisions of Article 8, if any of the Offer Conditions is  

 



12  not satisfied or waived at the Initial Expiration Time or at any other
Expiration Time of the Offer, Buyer shall extend the Offer (the length of such
extension period to be determined by Parent or Buyer, subject to clauses
(i)-(iii) below) from time to time until such Offer Condition or Offer
Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_ that (i) Buyer shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date, (ii) no such individual
extension of the Offer shall be for a period of more than ten Business Days,
and (iii) Buyer shall not be required to extend the Offer at any time that
Parent or Buyer is permitted to terminate this Agreement. Buyer shall extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the NASDAQ applicable to the Offer
or as may be required by any other Governmental Authority;  _provided_ , that
Buyer shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date later than the End
Date. Following expiration of the Offer, Buyer shall (and the Offer Documents
shall so indicate) provide a subsequent offering period ("Subsequent Offering
Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act of not less than five
nor more than twenty Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act). The Offer may not be terminated
prior to the Expiration Time (as the same may be extended pursuant to this
Section 2.01) unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.01. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, Buyer
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following such termination)
terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated by Buyer prior to the acceptance for payment and payment for
Shares tendered in the Offer, Buyer shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of Buyer to return, in accordance with Applicable
Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. Nothing in
this Section 2.01(c) shall affect any termination rights under Article 8\.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Buyer shall, and Parent
shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable
after the expiration of the Offer, all Shares (i) validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (ii) validly tendered in the Subsequent
Offering Period (the date on which Shares are first accepted for payment and
paid for under the Offer, the "Closing Date" and the acceptance for payment
and payment for Shares on the Closing Date, the "Closing"). The Cash
Consideration payable in respect of each Share pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be paid net of any applicable tax withholding with respect to
the Offer Consideration pursuant to Section 2.09 to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

 

(e) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Buyer
shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include the

 



13  summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase
and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents")
and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to
the extent required by applicable United States federal securities laws and
any other Applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Buyer all information concerning the Company required by the 1934 Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case to the extent required by applicable United States federal securities
laws and any other Applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Buyer shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Buyer shall provide
the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that Parent, Buyer or their counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff or other Governmental Authorities with
respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of
those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of Parent and Buyer to those comments and to
provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including by participating with Parent and
Buyer or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or other
Governmental Authorities to the extent such participation is permitted by the
SEC or other Governmental Authorities.

 

 __Section 2.02. _Company Action_. __

 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than approval of Independent Directors
required by Section 2.07) and the Tender Agreements. The Company represents
that it has been advised that all of the members of the Boards who own Shares
intend to tender such shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within three Business Days prior to the Offer
Commencement Date) furnish Parent with (i) a list of its shareholders and
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of its record holders of
Shares, (ii) any available listing and computer file containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of
Shares held in stock depositories, and (iii) copies of all lists of
shareholders, security position listings, computer files in the Companys
possession or control regarding the

 



14  beneficial owners of Shares, in each case, true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide such information
to the extent the Company is prohibited from providing such information by
the terms of its Articles of Association and/or by Applicable Law. In the
event that the Company is so prohibited from providing such information, it
shall (i) request permission from the applicable shareholders to provide such
information to Parent and Buyer and/or (ii) if the information requested is
not received at least three Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement
Date, the Company shall deliver to such shareholders all information that
would otherwise be required to be provided by Buyer and Parent to such
shareholders of the Company in connection with the Offer, and, notwithstanding
this Article 2, Buyer and Parent shall not have any obligation to deliver
such information to such shareholders under this Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Offer Commencement Date (and in any
event within ten Business Days of the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC), the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable United
States federal securities laws and any other Applicable Law, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject
to Section 5.03(e) and Section 5.03(f), shall reflect the Company
Recommendation. Parent and Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Buyer required by the 1934 Act to be set
forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Buyer agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become (or shall have become
known to be) false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
to the extent required by applicable United States federal securities laws
and any other Applicable Law. Parent, Buyer and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time
before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Buyer and their
counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Buyer and their counsel with (i)
any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff or other Governmental Authorities with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (to which

 



15  reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities to the extent such
participation is permitted by the SEC or other Governmental Authorities.

__Section 2.03.  _Outstanding Equity Awards_. __

(a) Each option to purchase Shares granted under any Company Plan, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing (each, a "Company Option") and that has an exercise price per share
that is less than or equal to the Cash Consideration shall become fully vested
and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Closing and, at the Closing,
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (i) a cash payment
from Parent at the Closing to the holder thereof equal to the product of (A)
the excess of the Cash Consideration over the applicable per share exercise
price of such Company Option multiplied by (B) the number of Shares subject to
such Company Option and (ii) one CVR for each Share subject to such Company
Option. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the preceding sentence,
any performance-vesting Company Option shall become fully vested and
exercisable at the applicable target level.

 

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each holder of a
Company Option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than the
Cash Consideration shall be provided with written notice by the Company as
soon as practicable after the date hereof that such holder shall, during the
period beginning on the date of such notice and ending on the Business
Day preceding the Closing Date (the "Exercise Period"), have the right to
exercise such Company Option by providing the Company with a notice of
exercise and a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the excess of the
applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option over the Cash
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Option, with such exercise conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing. Each
Company Option that is exercised pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) shall be
settled at the Closing in exchange for, in respect of each Share subject to
such Company Option, one CVR. Any Company Option described in this Section
2.03(b) that is not exercised during the Exercise Period or at any other time
prior to the closing of the Reorganization (as defined below) shall be
cancelled at the closing of the Reorganization for no consideration therefor.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.03(b). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section
2.03(b), any performance-vesting Company Option shall become fully vested and
exercisable at the applicable target level.

 



16 (c) Each restricted Share that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing and that was granted or issued under any Company Plan (each, a
"Company Restricted Share") and that is validly tendered (and not withdrawn)
by the holder of such Company Restricted Share pursuant to the Offer shall
become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Closing, and such tendered
Company Restricted Share shall be treated as a validly tendered Share as
provided under Section 2.01(d). Any Company Restricted Share that is not
validly tendered (or that is withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall remain
outstanding after the Closing in accordance with its terms; _provided_ that
(i) to the extent such Company Restricted Share becomes vested as of the
consummation of the Offer, the Asset Sale or other Reorganization, as
applicable, such Company Restricted Share shall be treated in the same way as
any other Share that is not tendered in the Offer under the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) to the extent such Company Restricted Share does not
become vested as of the consummation of the Offer, the Asset Sale or other
Reorganization, as applicable, (x) to the extent not prohibited by the
applicable award agreement, the Company shall repurchase such Company
Restricted Share at the consummation of the Offer, the Asset Sale or other
Reorganization, as applicable, for a cash payment equal to the issue price of
such Company Restricted Share (in which case, the Boards shall take all
actions necessary to effect such repurchase on such terms) and (y) otherwise,
the Company Restricted Share shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and one CVR.

 

 __Section 2.04. _Extraordinary General Meeting._ __

 

(a) On or prior to the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall duly call,
give notice and, as soon as practicable following the date hereof taking into
account a notice period of at least 35 calendar days and that notice will not
be given until the Pre-Launch Condition has been satisfied or waived (but in
any event prior to the Closing), hold an extraordinary meeting
of shareholders (the "EGM") to:

(i) provide information regarding the Offer;

 

(ii) accept resignations from, and provide discharge to, all but two of the
existing members of the Boards and, subject to Section 2.04(f) and Section
2.05, appoint such new members to the Boards as designated by Buyer to replace
such resigning directors;

 

(iii) approve the sale by the Company effective as of the Closing, pursuant to
a sale and purchase agreement in customary form (an "Asset Sale Agreement"),
of all of the assets, including any Tax attributes to the extent transferable,
and assumption of all liabilities of the Company (including, at the discretion
of Buyer, the Companys Subsidiaries) to Buyer and/or one or more of its
designees for aggregate consideration of

 



17  (A) a note payable (the "Note Payable") from Buyer or one or more of its
designees in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the total number of outstanding Shares as of the Closing (which
Note Payable shall be prepayable without penalty or premium but shall require
Buyer to pay to the Company, on or promptly following the completion of the
Subsequent Offering Period, an amount of the Note Payable equal to the Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of outstanding Shares not tendered in
the Offer or the Subsequent Offering Period), (B) a note (the "Convertible
Note") from Buyer convertible into an aggregate amount of CVRs equal to the
total number of outstanding Shares as of the Closing (which Convertible Note
shall be prepayable without penalty or premium but shall require Buyer to
distribute to the Company, on or promptly following the completion of the
Subsequent Offering Period, a number of CVRs equal to the number of Shares not
tendered in the Offer or the Subsequent Offering Period, (the "Note
Conversion")) and (C) the assumption by Buyer and/or its designees of all
liabilities and obligations of the Company (including the Companys
Subsidiaries), whether actual, contingent or otherwise, including the express
assumption of all contractual obligations (and also including the
related obligation of Buyer or its designees to fully indemnify and hold
harmless the Company with respect to all such assumed liabilities and
obligations) (the transaction described in this clause (iii) and the Second
Step Distribution, the "Asset Sale"); and

(iv) resolve upon the liquidation and dissolution of the Company following
such Asset Sale with the aim that the proceeds of such sale will be
distributed by means of a liquidation distribution (which may be an advance
distribution, as described in Section 2.04(e)) (the "Second
Step Distribution") to the shareholders of the Company such that each holder
of Shares that were not tendered in the Offer or during the Subsequent
Offering Period shall receive cash and CVRs in an amount equal to the Offer
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares then held by such holder (in
the case of the Cash Consideration, without interest, less any applicable
withholding taxes with respect to the Offer Consideration).

 

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
appropriate materials for the EGM (together with any amendments
and supplements thereto and any other required, the "EGM Materials") relating
to the matters set forth in 
Section 2.04(a). Subject to Section 5.03(e) and Section 5.03(f), the Company
shall include the Company Recommendation in the EGM Materials. Parent and
Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent
and Buyer required to be set forth in the EGM Materials. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the EGM Materials each time prior to

 



18  dissemination to the shareholders of the Company and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its
counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Buyer and their counsel, to the
extent permitted under Applicable Law, with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from Governmental Authorities with respect to the
EGM Materials promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications
and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Companys response to
those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable
and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with
the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with Governmental
Authorities to the extent such participation is permitted by the
applicable Governmental Authority.

__(c) The Company shall give Parent no less than three Business Days  advance
notice of the date which shall be set as the "record date" for the EGM. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the EGM and shall not
cancel the EGM without the prior written consent of Parent; __provided__ that
the Company may, following reasonable consultation with Parent, cancel the
EGM to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or
amendment to EGM Materials that the Company Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, reasonably determines is necessary to comply with Applicable
Law, is made available to the Companys shareholders in advance of the EGM. In
the event the EGM is cancelled pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company
shall duly call, give notice of, and hold the EGM as soon as practicable
following the date of such cancellation. __

(d) The Company shall ensure that the EGM is called, noticed, convened, held
and conducted, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Law.
The adoption of the matters set forth in Section 2.04(a) shall be the only
matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders
of the Company at the EGM, unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent, in
its sole discretion.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or Section 8.01(d)(i),
the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the EGM shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation
Change and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article 8, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of
the shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the shareholders of the Company with
respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.04.

 



19 (f) In connection with the Asset Sale, Buyer shall provide a guarantee to the
liquidator as to any deficit in the estate of the Company, so as to enable
the liquidator to pay the Offer Consideration (in the case of the Cash
Consideration, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes with
respect to the Offer Consideration) by means of an advance liquidation
distribution to holders of Shares that were not tendered in the Offer or
during the Subsequent Offering Period. The approvals by Company shareholders
of the resignations and appointments, the sale of the Companys assets, the
liquidation and dissolution of the Company and the distribution of the
liquidation proceeds referred to in Section 2.04(a) (the "Shareholder
Approvals") will be effective as of, and conditional upon the occurrence of,
the Closing. At the EGM, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the Shareholder Approvals, such Shareholder Approvals to be effective
as of, and conditional upon, the occurrence of the Closing.

 

 __Section 2.05. _Directors_. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and no later than the Offer Commencement Date, Buyer shall
designate in writing to the Company the new members for the Boards for
purposes of Section 2.04(a)(ii) (the " __Buyer Directors __"). For the
avoidance of doubt, no fewer than two of the current directors of the Company
(the " __Independent Directors __"), to be mutually agreed upon by the Buyer
and the Company, shall remain on the supervisory board of the Company until
the earlier of (i) such time after the Closing as the Buyer owns 100% of the
outstanding Shares, (ii) the date the liquidation of the Company shall have
been duly completed, or (iii) one year after the date hereof. The Company
shall promptly take all actions and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as any
Applicable Law may require in order to fulfill its obligations under Section
2.04. The Company shall take any and all other actions necessary to appoint
the Buyer Directors to the Boards effective immediately following the Closing,
and shall take all actions reasonably requested by Parent or Buyer in
furtherance thereof. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by any such Applicable
Laws. Buyer shall cause all directors of the Company to be discharged at the
annual general meeting of the Company held in 2015 for their acts of
management or supervision, as applicable, as appears from the books and
records of the Company, provided that no discharge shall have to be granted to
a director for acts for which serious blame can be attributed to him or her (
_een ernstig verwijt kan worden gemaakt_ ). __

__Section 2.06 _. Further Actions_. If requested by Parent, the Company and
Buyer shall take as of the date of this Agreement or as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practical, but effective no earlier than the Closing, the following
actions to the extent reasonably necessary or desirable to accomplish the
Asset Sale and/or the Reorganization: (a) in the case of the Company, the
convening of __

 



20 _ _ the necessary meetings of the Company shareholders and the Boards
(including the EGM referenced in Section 2.04), (b) in the case of the
Company, the consideration and approval of resolutions by the Boards for the
purpose of the Reorganization and the consideration and approval of any Board
resolutions (the " __Approval of the Boards __") necessary or desirable to
convene the EGM referenced in Section 2.04 and approve the Asset Sale to
Buyer or its designee and the liquidation and dissolution of the Company, in
each case as set forth in Section 2.04, subject to Section 2.07, and (c) in
the case of Buyer and the Company, the execution of any and all reasonably
requested documents, agreements or deeds that are necessary or desirable to
effectuate the Reorganization and/or the Asset Sale and the filing or
registration of any or all of such documents, agreements or deeds with
the appropriate Governmental Authorities. __

__Section 2.07 _. Reorganization_. As promptly as practicable following
the closing of the Subsequent Offering Period, Buyer shall effectuate a
corporate reorganization (the " __Reorganization __") of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, which may include, (a) the Asset Sale, which may include,
at Parents request, the amendment of the Articles of Association of the
Company to permit the creation, among other things, of separate classes of
shares in order to effect the foregoing or (b) if permissable under Applicable
Law, the commencement of a compulsory acquisition by Buyer of Shares from any
remaining minority shareholder in accordance with Section 2:92a of the Dutch
Civil Code, in each case, which may be accompanied by the termination of the
listing of the Shares on the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company
under the 1934 Act and the cessation of the Companys reporting obligations
thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 2.07, the Reorganization, if completed,
shall be conducted in accordance with Applicable Law and shall result in all
holders of Shares that were not tendered in the Offer or during the Subsequent
Offering Period being offered or receiving in the Reorganization for each
Share then held cash and CVRs in an amount equal to the Offer Consideration
(in the case of Cash Consideration, without interest, less applicable
withholding taxes with respect to the Offer Consideration), as soon
as reasonably possible after the Closing. If Parent determines it is not
reasonably practicable (which shall be deemed to include adverse tax
consequences) to effectuate a Reorganization of the type described in clauses
(a) or (b) of the first sentence of this Section 2.07, it will use reasonable
best efforts to effectuate a Reorganization in a different manner with the
prior approval of the Independent Directors, subject to the immediately
foregoing sentence. __

 

 __Section 2.08 _. Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that, during the period between
the date hereof and the Expiration Time, the number of outstanding Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall be
changed into a different number of shares or securities or a different
class as a result of a reclassification, __

 



21 _ _ stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or
other similar transaction, then the Offer Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that, in any case, nothing in
this Section 2.08 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement. __

 

 __Section 2.09. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Parent, Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as Parent, Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates may
be required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries
(including any deliveries of CVRs) and payments under Applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, they shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. __

49 Section 5.02. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Closing
and subject to Applicable Law and the confidentiality agreement dated as of
July 31, 2014 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), the Company shall (i) give Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives, upon reasonable
notice, reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and
operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request
and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives to cooperate reasonably with Parent in its
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant
to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall require the Company to
provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would violate any Applicable Law
(including antitrust and privacy laws) or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) protected by attorney-client
privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be reasonably protected by the
Company through exercise of its reasonable efforts. If any material is
withheld by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company shall inform Parent as to the
general nature of what is being withheld and the basis for withholding such
material and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make substitute
arrangements so as to provide Parent and its Representatives with such access.
No such access, nor any information obtained therefrom, shall be deemed to
cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or
have any effect for purposes of determining satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, or the compliance with any covenant set forth herein.

 

Section 5.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers._

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries permit any of its or their officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
or other agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to knowingly induce,
facilitate or encourage the submission or announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including by way of
furnishing or providing access to non-public information to a Third Party);

 



50 (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or otherwise knowingly
cooperate in any way with any Third Party that has made an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar instrument relating to, or
that is intended to or would be reasonably likely to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate,
materially delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

__(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.03(a), at any time prior to the Closing Date,
the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish non-public information to, any
Third Party and its Representatives that has made a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing Date to the Boards by such Third Party (and
not withdrawn) if: __

 

(i) the submission of such Acquisition Proposal shall not have resulted from
the breach by the Company or any Representative of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of the provisions set forth in Section 5.03(a);

__(ii) the Boards reasonably conclude in good faith, after consultation with
their outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; __

(iii) at least 24 hours prior to furnishing any such information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Third Party (or its Representatives),
Parent receives written notice from the Company of the identity of such Third
Party and of the Companys intention to furnish

 



51  information to, or enter into discussions with, such Third Party, and the
Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in a
customary form that is no less favorable to the Company (including standstill
provisions) than the Confidentiality Agreement and does not contain any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") (which the Company may negotiate with
the Third Party during the 24 hour notice period and enter into during such
period or thereafter);

 

(iv) the Company provides or makes available all such information to Parent
(to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it
is provided or made available to such Third Party); and

 

(v) the Boards determine in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action could be inconsistent with
their fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the
Boards from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
1934 Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any
legally required disclosure to shareholders with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) issuing a
"stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (iii) contacting and
engaging in discussions with any person or group and their respective
Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited
in breach of Section 5.03(a) solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof ( _provided_ that, in the cases of
both clauses (i) and (ii) above, any such disclosure or communication does
not contain an Adverse Recommendation Change unless permitted by Section
5.03(e) or Section 5.03(f)).

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in Section
5.03, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than two
Business Days) orally and in writing after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has notified the Company that
it may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Each such
notice shall include (i) the identity of the Third Party making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal or request, and (ii) a copy of all written
materials provided

 



52  by such Third Party in connection with, and the material terms of, such
Acquisition Proposal. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal or request,
the Company shall continue promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of any
material change or development with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) to
keep Parent reasonably informed orally or in writing of the status, terms and
pertinent details of any such Acquisition Proposal or request (including by
providing prompt notice of all material amendments or proposed material
amendments thereto).

(d) Except as expressly permitted under Section 5.03(e) or Section 5.03(f),
none of the Company, the Boards or any committee thereof shall (i)(A)
withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the Schedule 14D-9 or the EGM
Materials, withdraw, qualify or modify (or resolve, determine or publicly
propose to withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the Schedule 14D-9 or
the EGM Materials, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation or
(B) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to shareholders or declare advisable
(or resolve, determine or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend,
submit to shareholders or declare advisable) any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to
shareholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine or publicly propose
to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to shareholders or declare advisable), or
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, other than as a result of breaching
or violating Section 5.03(a), that the Boards conclude in good faith, after
consultation with their outside legal counsel and financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Boards
may, at any time prior to the Closing Date, if they determine in good faith,
after consultation with their outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such actions contemplated by clauses (x) and/or (y) below would likely be
inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (x)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal
and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i) and
simultaneously enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) or Section
8.01(d)(i), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
or Section 8.01(d)(i) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in
advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section
8.01(d)(i) and Section 9.04(a)(i); and provided, further, that the Boards may
not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause
(x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing

 



53  clause (y) or Section 8.01(d)(i) unless: (i) the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in advance (the
"Superior Proposal Notice Period"), of its intention to effect such an
Adverse Recommendation Change (which notice itself shall not constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change) and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
which notice shall identify the Third Party or group making such Superior
Proposal, and contain the execution draft of the relevant proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (which shall include the financial terms of such
Superior Proposal) with the Third Party or group making such Superior Proposal
and any other material documents with respect to such Superior Proposal
(including any with respect to the financing thereof); and (ii) prior
to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminating this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused the Companys Representatives to, during the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent
shall not have, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, made a written
offer that would, after consideration of such offer by the Boards in good
faith and after consultation with their outside legal counsel and financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, result in the Boards determining
that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the
event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal after the start of the Superior Proposal
Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(e)(i) and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 5.03(e) with respect to such new written notice (including a
new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the five Business
Days contemplated by Section 5.03(e)(i) above). 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Boards may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change prior to the Closing Date if each of the Boards
determines in good faith, after consultation with their outside legal counsel
and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to
do so would likely be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; provided, however, that the Boards may not effect such an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless: (i) the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in advance (the
"Intervening Event Notice Period"), of its intention to effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change (which notice itself shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail such

 



54  Intervening Event; and (ii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change, (A) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have
caused the Companys Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that an Adverse Recommendation
Change is no longer necessary, and (B) Parent shall not have, during the
Intervening Event Notice Period, made a written offer that that, after due
consideration of such offer by the Boards in good faith and after consultation
with their outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, results in both Boards determining that it would not
continue to be likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law to not effect the Adverse Recommendation Change. In the
event of any material changes to the circumstances applicable to the
Intervening Event, after the start of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant
to Section 5.03(f)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.03(f) with respect to such new written notice (including a new Intervening
Event Notice Period) except the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be at
least three Business Days (rather than the five Business Days contemplated by
Section 5.03(f)(i) above).

(g) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment
to this Agreement and to the extent required by Applicable Law to be disclosed
in any Company SEC Documents or otherwise in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(h) No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Boards
for purposes of causing any Anti-Takeover Measure to be applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Tender Agreements.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ ,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn and that
did not result from a breach of the provisions of Section 5.03(a)) to acquire
all of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which (a) is not subject to a
financing condition (and if financing is required, such financing is
committed, or is reasonably expected to be committed, to the Third Party or
"group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act) making such
Acquisition Proposal), (b) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms
and conditions contemplated thereby, and (c) the Boards determine in good
faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation, is on terms more favorable to the
Companys shareholders and other stakeholders than as provided hereunder, in
each case taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal, including the financial and financing terms thereof,
the likelihood of consummation in a timely manner, and the identity of the
Third Party or group making such proposal.



 



55 (j) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours following the execution of this
Agreement) demand that each Third Party that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to such Third
Partys consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal at any time
after January 1, 2014 (other than agreements that have expired by their
terms) to immediately return or destroy (which destruction shall subsequently
be certified in writing by such Third Party to the Company if such Third Party
is required to do so pursuant to the terms of the non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreement between such Third Party and the Company) all
confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or Representatives to such
Third Party, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or
Representatives.

Section 5.04.  _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Expiration Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that
may be required, necessary or advisable to cause each Company Plan or similar
arrangement that has been or after the date of this Agreement will be entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any of its directors,
officers or employees pursuant to which consideration is payable to any
director, officer or employee to be approved by the Compensation Committee as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the 1934 Act. At the time of the taking of such steps described in this
Section 5.04, the Compensation Committee will be composed solely of
"independent directors" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto.

Section 5.05. _Anti-Takeover Measures_. The Company and the Boards shall take
all actions within their power and authority necessary so that the
restrictions of any Anti-Takeover Measures do not prevent or materially delay
any and all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Anti-
Takeover Measure becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated

or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Closing with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the

available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing, for a cost
not exceeding such amount).

with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
