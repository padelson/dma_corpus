prepare a list of the specific  Assets  which Seller or TOPIII did not
actually transfer and deliver to Purchaser  on the  Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets List"). At least two (2)  Business Days
prior to the Audit, Purchaser shall notify Seller and TOPIII  of  the date
and time at which the Audit will commence and Seller and TOPIII  shall  each
have the right, but not the obligation, to have their respective 
representatives present for the duration of the Audit; provided, however, 
if  Purchaser fails to provide such notice to Seller and TOPIII, then
Seller  and  TOPIII shall be relieved of any obligations under Section
2.7(b). If Seller  and  TOPIII dispute the Closing Date Non-Transferred
Assets List, Seller and TOPIII  shall notify Purchaser in writing within five
(5) Business Days after receipt  of  the Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets
List ("Seller's Dispute Notice").  Seller's Dispute Notice shall specify each
item to which Seller and TOPIII take  exception, specifying in reasonable
detail the nature and extent of any such  exception; provided, however, if
Seller and TOPIII do not deliver Seller's  Dispute Notice within the five (5)
Business Day period, the Closing Date  Non-Transferred Assets List shall be
deemed accepted by Seller and TOPIII  and  shall be conclusive and binding
on Seller, TOPIII and Purchaser for the purposes  of the adjustment described
in Section 2.7(b).

 

 

(b) Subject  to Section 2.7(d), if the fair market value of the items listed
on the Closing  Date Non-Transferred Assets List prepared by the Auditor
under Section 2.7(a)  exceeds $25,000 individually or $50,000 in the
aggregate, Seller or TOPIII,  as  the case may be, shall, at Purchaser's
sole option and election, either (i) pay  Purchaser, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price paid by Purchaser, an amount  equal to the fair market value
of the Assets not so transferred and delivered  to  Purchaser on the Closing
Date, or (ii) replace the missing Asset or Assets  with  replacements of the
same value, quality and warranty satisfactory to Purchaser  in its reasonable
discretion. Any payments required to be made by Seller  or  TOPIII pursuant
to this Section shall be made by wire transfer of immediately  available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser and shall  be  made
by Seller or TOPIII, as the case may be, within ten (10) Business Days  of 
the date on which the Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets List is delivered 
to  Seller or TOPIII, and becomes conclusive and binding on Seller and
Purchaser  or  TOPIII and Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.7(a). Any
replacements  required to be delivered by Seller or TOPIII pursuant to this
Section shall  be  delivered to Purchaser within a reasonable time.
Notwithstanding anything  to the  contrary, Purchaser reserves all rights it
may have against Seller or TOPIII  at  law or in equity arising from
Seller's or TOPIII's failure to transfer and  deliver to Purchaser on the
Closing Date all Assets disclosed on the disclosure  schedules as of the
Effective Date.

 

 

(c) Any  dispute between Seller or TOPIII and Purchaser regarding the Closing
Date  Non-Transferred Assets List shall be resolved in accordance with
Section  2.8.

(d) If  any of  the items listed on the Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets
List are Operating  Assets, Seller and TOPIII shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to deliver  and transfer to Purchaser such Operating
Assets within ten (10) Business  Days of  the date on which the Closing Date
Non-Transferred Assets List is delivered  to  Seller and becomes conclusive
and binding on Seller and Purchaser or TOPIII  and  Purchaser in accordance
with Section 2.7(a); provided that if, despite the  use  of Commercially
Reasonable Efforts, Seller or TOPIII, as the case may be,  is  unable to
transfer and deliver to Purchaser all of such Operating Assets,  and if  the
fair market value of the items listed on the Closing Date Non-Transferred 
Assets List (a) exceeds $25,000 individually or $50,000 in the aggregate, 
Seller  or TOPIII, as the case may be, shall, at Purchaser's sole option and
election,  either (i) pay Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
paid by  Purchaser, an amount equal to the fair market value of such
Operating Assets  not  so transferred and delivered to Purchaser, or (ii)
replace the missing Operating  Assets with replacements of the same value,
quality and warranty satisfactory  to  Purchaser in its reasonable
discretion, each in accordance with Section 2.7(b).  In addition, in the
event that Seller, TOPIII or Purchaser discovers at any  time  after the
Closing Date that any Operating Assets were not actually transferred  and
delivered to Purchaser on the Closing Date and such missing Operating 
Assets  were not included on the Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets List,
such Party  shall notify the other Parties, which notice shall include a list
of such  missing Operating Assets, and Seller or TOPIII, as the case may be,
shall  use  Commercially Reasonable Efforts to transfer and deliver such
missing Operating  Assets to Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
any Operating  Assets  that were not identified in the Schedules attached to
this Agreement and  were  not transferred and delivered to Purchaser on the
Closing Date, Seller's and  TOPIII's obligation to use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to transfer and  deliver such undisclosed and missing
Operating Assets to Purchaser pursuant  to  this Section 2.7(d) shall be
Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy for the  failure of Seller and TOPIII
to transfer and deliver such undisclosed and  missing Operating Assets on the
Closing Date, and Seller and TOPIII shall  not  have any additional
liability or obligation hereunder as a result of such  failure, including,
without limitation, any liability or obligation to pay  more  than Seller's
50% share of all transfer and documentary transfer Taxes arising  in
connection with the transfer of the Assets, including any sales or use 
tax,  pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(1).

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, the Parties hereto
agree that neither Seller  nor Purchaser shall seek a ruling or determination
from the Texas Comptroller  of  Public Accounts or other applicable
Governmental Authority regarding the  sales  and/or use tax consequences
arising from the transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement without
receiving prior written consent of the other Party, such  consent to be
provided at the sole discretion of each Party. The Parties  hereto  agree to
cooperate with each other in connection with preparing and pursuing  any 
such ruling or determination, if any, that they may agree is  desirable.

 

 

2.8 _Resolution  of Dispute Regarding Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets
List_.  Any  dispute which may arise between Seller or TOPIII and Purchaser
regarding  the  Closing Date Non-Transferred Assets List shall be resolved
in the following  manner:

(b) If  at the  end of the five (5) Business Day period specified in
subsection (a) above,  Seller, TOPIII and Purchaser fail to reach a written
agreement with respect  to  such dispute, the Parties may exercise any
rights they may have at law or  in  equity.

 

 

2.9 [ _Reserved_ ].

 

 

2.10 [ _Reserved_ ].

 

 

2.11 _Earn-out_.  In the  event that (i) the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality issues a final  air  quality permit to construct that
authorizes the construction of the Proposed  Expansion on terms  and 
conditions that are materially similar to those specified in the Application 
for Air Quality Permit No. 76381 and PSD-TX-1054 (TOPIII) submitted to the 
Texas  Commission on Environmental Quality on July 13, 2005, Seller and
TOPIII shall  be  entitled to receive from Purchaser an aggregate amount
equal to Two Million  Five  Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in cash
within ten (10) Business Days  of  the later to occur of the Closing Date
and the date of such permit issuance,  and  (ii) within two (2) years after
the date of such permit issuance, (a) Purchaser  (or its designee) proceeds
with actual physical on-site construction of the  Proposed Expansion beyond
site clearing activities or (b) Purchaser (or its  designee) sells, auctions
or otherwise transfers to a third party (which  is not  its Affiliate) the
opportunity to construct the Proposed Expansion, Seller  and  TOPIII shall
be entitled to receive from Purchaser an aggregate amount equal  to  Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in cash within ten  (10) 
Business Days of the earlier to occur of (ii)(a) and (b), above; provided, 
however, that for purposes of this Section 2.11, an air quality permit shall 
be  deemed "final" when it is final and appealable, being no longer subject
to  further challenge through any proceeding or other process initiated
before  the  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

(10) days  prior to the Closing Date, Seller is the owner of record title to

surveys, abstracts  or  title opinions in the possession of Seller, TOPIII
or their respective agents  or  representatives, and any policies of title
insurance currently in force and  in  the possession of Seller, TOPIII or
their respective agents or representatives  with respect to the Owned
Property have heretofore been made available to  Purchaser.

 

 

(d) To  Seller's or TOPIII's Knowledge, there have been no material changes
on the  ground since the Initial Closing Date that would be shown on an
update of  the  ALTA Survey delivered to Seller in connection with the 2002
Purchase and  Sale  Agreement that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect  on  the Owned Property or the Real Property
Interests

 

 

(e) In  no  event shall any of the foregoing representations in this Section
3.17 be  deemed  breached to the extent they are not true as a result of
facts or circumstances  existing prior to the Initial Closing Date, or

thereunder.

insurance with respect to the Assets nor has coverage been limited by any 
insurance carrier to which either Seller or TOPIII has applied for any such 
insurance or with which any Seller has carried insurance during the last 
twelve  (12) months. For purposes of this Section 3.18 "Insurance," insurance
quoted at  commercially unreasonable premiums which either Seller or TOPIII

carrier.

complete list of  all employees of Seller employed at the Facility (including

not reasonably be expected to create a Material Adverse  Effect. Seller and
TOPIII have complied in all material respects with all  applicable laws,
rules and regulations relating to withholding Taxes relating  to  Seller's
Employees. All Tax Returns relating to the Assets are true, correct and 
complete in all material respects. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.21 "Tax 
Matters," no notice of deficiency or assessment has been received from any 
taxing authority with respect to liabilities for Taxes of Seller and TOPIII 
in  respect of the Assets, which have not been fully paid or finally
settled,  and  any such deficiency shown in Schedule 3.21 "Tax Matters" is

or waivers extending the  applicable statutory periods of limitation for
Taxes associated with the  Assets  that will be binding upon Purchaser after

treated as being owned by any other person  pursuant to the so-called safe
harbor lease provisions of former Section  168(f)  of the Code, and none of
the Assets is "tax-exempt use" property within the  meaning of Section 168(h)
of the Code. Schedule 3.21 "Tax Matters" sets forth  the taxing jurisdictions
in which Seller and TOPIII own assets or conducts  business that require a
notification to a taxing authority of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, if the failure to make such notification  or  obtain Tax
clearance certificates in connection therewith would either require 
Purchaser to withhold any portion of the Purchase Price or subject Purchaser 
to  any liability for any Taxes of Seller or TOPIII.

 

 

3.22 _Intellectual  Property_.  Schedule 2.1(i) "Intellectual Property,"
sets forth all Intellectual Property  used in and, individually or in the

is not being infringed by any other Person. Seller  has not  received notice
that it is infringing any Intellectual Property of any other  Person in
connection with the operation or business of the Facility or the  Assets,
and, to Seller's Knowledge, Seller is not infringing any Intellectual 
Property of any other Person the effect of which, individually or in the 
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect.

Third Parties, as necessary, of the change  in  ownership of the Assets

required by applicable law or the Assigned Contracts.

 

 

(c) Purchaser  will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain those
approvals, consents  or  Permits listed on Schedule 5.3(c) "Purchaser's

transactions of the kind and nature contemplated by the respective 
agreement. Each Party will bear its own costs for these applications and 
proceedings except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6 "Taxes, Prorations
and  Closing Costs." Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller

the course of such litigation, arbitration or settlement,  and (ii) no
settlement of the Disputes shall be made prior to the Closing  Date  without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may not be 
unreasonably withheld; provided further that in the event that Seller enters 
into a settlement of the Disputes without the consent of Purchaser, Seller 
and  Purchaser shall enter into good faith discussions to seek to agree on a
possible  reduction of the Purchase Price, the scope of which must be
mutually agreed  upon  by the Parties. In the event the Parties are unable
to agree on a reduction  to  the Purchase Price within ten (10) Business
Days of such settlement, then  Purchaser shall have, as its sole remedy, the
right to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.14(a)(6). After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i)  take  control of the prosecution of the
litigation, if any, the negotiations  and the arbitration, if any, in 
respect of the Disputes at its sole cost and expense and shall keep Seller 
informed of all material developments relating thereto and (ii) have the 
right  to enter into any settlement of the Disputes; provided that no
settlement  shall  be made unless it provides a complete release of Seller
and its Affiliates  from  any and all liabilities and obligations to Walnut
Creek and its Affiliates  arising out of such Disputes.

arising under or resulting from such  Asset or Assets), although Seller or

(2) Purchaser  is not required to accept an interest in a particular Asset or
Assets (other  than the Fuel Agreement and the Power Agreements, the
transfers of which  are  governed by Section 6.15 and Section 7.12 below)
(or any claim, right or  benefit  arising under or resulting from such Asset
or Assets), although Purchaser  may  elect to do so, if an assignment or
transfer or an attempt to make such an  assignment or transfer is (A) without
the consent of a Third Party if such  consent is required for the Asset or
Assets to be transferred to Purchaser,  (B)  a violation of any law, decree,
Order or regulation of any Governmental  Authority or (C) subject to terms
and conditions which are materially more  onerous than those in effect on the

(3) Nothing  contained in this Section 5.3(f) "No Transfer if Consent or
Approval Not  Obtained" shall limit or modify the Parties' respective
obligations under the  other provisions of this Section 5.3 "Consents and

Seller and TOPIII, Seller  and  TOPIII shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser regarding the transition  of  ownership, operation and/or
maintenance of the Facility and the Assets to  Purchaser, including access to
facilitate Purchaser's integration of accounting,  insurance,
telecommunications and management information systems and other  operations
at the Facility with Purchaser's programs and systems. Solely with  respect
to work done by Seller or TOPIII at Purchaser's request to facilitate 
Purchaser's integration of its systems and operations described in the
preceding  sentence and to further the separation of the Assets from any of
the Excluded  Assets, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller and TOPIII for their
actual reasonable  costs for the personnel performing such work. After the
Closing, each Party  will, upon the reasonable request of the other Party,
execute and deliver  any  further instruments or documents of conveyance,
assignment, assumption or  transfer, and take such further actions using
Commercially Reasonable Efforts  as  may reasonably be required to fulfill
and implement the terms of this Agreement  or realize the benefits intended
to be afforded hereby. For a period of three  (3) years immediately following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall reasonably  cooperate with Seller and
TOPIII regarding the filing of all required documents  with the PUC, FERC, or
any other Governmental Authority to the extent directly  related to the
transactions contemplated hereby. If any Excluded Assets are

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

inadvertently  delivered to Purchaser, Purchaser will promptly return the
same to Seller  and/or  TOPIII, as the case may be, to the extent Purchaser
obtains Knowledge of  such  inadvertent delivery. On the Closing Date,
Seller and TOPIII shall deliver  to  Purchaser the original drawings, sepias
and bluelines related solely to the  Assets and not located on the Site.

 

 

5.6 _Taxes,  Prorations and Closing Costs_.

 

 

(a) _Taxes_.

 

 

(1) Purchaser  shall pay 50% and Seller shall pay 50% of all transfer and
documentary transfer  Taxes, arising in connection with the transfer of the
Assets, including any  sales or use tax. Seller and Purchaser will each pay
their own Income Taxes.  State and local real and personal property Taxes
relating to the Assets for  the  tax year ending December 31, 2006 (which
taxes are due and payable on or  before  January 31, 2007) will be prorated
between Purchaser and Seller on the following  basis: Seller shall be
responsible for all such Taxes for the period up to  the  Closing Date and
Purchaser shall be responsible for all such Taxes for the  period on and
after the Closing Date. All Taxes assessed on an annual basis  will  be
prorated on the assumption that an equal amount of Taxes applies to each 
day  of the year, regardless of how any installment payments are billed or
made,  except that Purchaser will bear all supplemental or other state and
local  real  and personal property Taxes which arise out of a change in
ownership of the  Assets.

 

 

(2) If  the  amount of real and personal property Taxes due for the 2006 tax
year (commencing  January 1, 2006) has not been assessed by the taxing
authorities as of the  Closing Date, then the amount of real and personal
property Taxes as prorated  between Seller and Purchaser for the 2006 tax
year will be estimated on the  basis of the 2005 tax year's real and personal
property taxes and such amount  will be subject to a true-up adjustment after
the Closing Date based upon  the  actual amount of Taxes assessed.

 

 

(3) Seller  will be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes relating to
the Assets  for  the period after the Initial Closing Date and prior to the
Closing Date and  the  Purchaser shall be entitled to such refunds or
credits of Taxes relating  to the  Assets for the period prior to the
Initial Closing Date or on and after the  Closing Date. Each Party will
promptly notify and forward to the other Party  the  amounts of any such
refunds or credits within thirty (30) days after receipt  thereof.

 

 

(4) After  the  Closing Date, Purchaser will notify Seller and TOPIII in
writing, within  fifteen  (15) days after its receipt of any correspondence,
notice or other communication  from a taxing authority or any representative
thereof, of any pending or  threatened tax audit, or any pending or
threatened judicial or administrative  proceeding that involves Taxes
relating to the Assets for the period after  the  Initial Closing Date and
prior to the Closing Date, and furnish Seller and  TOPIII with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority  in  connection with any
audit or information request with respect to any such  Taxes  relating to
the Assets for the period after the Initial Closing Date and  prior  to the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, Seller

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

and  TOPIII will notify Purchaser in writing, within fifteen (15) days after
its  receipt of any correspondence, notice or other communication from a
taxing  authority or any representative thereof, of any pending or threatened
tax  audit,  or any pending or threatened judicial or administrative
proceeding that involves  Taxes relating to the Assets for the period prior
to the Initial Closing  Date or  after the Closing Date, and furnish
Purchaser with copies of all correspondence  received from any taxing
authority in connection with any audit or information  request with respect
to any such Taxes relating to the Assets for the period  prior to the Initial
Closing Date or after the Closing Date.

 

 

(5) Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, with
respect to any claim  for  refund, audit, examination, notice of deficiency
or assessment or any judicial  or administrative proceeding that involves
Taxes relating to the Assets  (collectively, "Tax Claim"), each Party will
reasonably cooperate with the other  Party in prosecuting and/or contesting
any Tax Claim, including making available  original books, records, documents
and information for inspection, copying  and,  if necessary, introduction as
evidence at any such Tax Claim contest or  proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis  to  provide additional information
or explanation of any material provided hereunder  with respect to such Tax
Claim or to testify at proceedings relating to such  Tax  Claim. Seller and
TOPIII will control all proceedings taken in connection  with  any Tax Claim
that pertains entirely to the period after the Initial Closing  Date and
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will control all proceedings  taken  in
connection with any Tax Claim that pertains entirely to the period prior 
to  the Initial Closing Date or on or after the Closing Date, and Seller,
TOPIII  and  Purchaser will jointly control all proceedings taken in
connection with any  Tax  Claim pertaining to the period after the Initial
Closing Date and both prior  to  and after the Closing Date; provided,
however, Purchaser may request that  Seller  or TOPIII take any action
reasonably necessary to remove any liens or other  encumbrances on the Assets
relating to any Tax Claim that pertains entirely  to  the period after the
Initial Closing Date and prior to the Closing Date.  Purchaser has no right
to settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim which  pertains entirely to
the period after the Initial Closing Date and prior  to the  Closing Date;
neither Seller nor TOPIII have a right to settle or otherwise  compromise any
Tax Claim which pertains entirely to the period prior to the  Initial Closing
Date or on or after the Closing Date and neither Party has  the  right to
settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim which pertains to the  period
after the Initial Closing Date and both prior to and on or after the  Closing
Date without the other Party's prior written consent, which consent  shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(b) _Income  and Expenses_.  Except  as set forth in this Section 5.6
"Taxes, Prorations and Closing Costs," all  items of income and expense,
including rents and other charges under the  Assigned Contracts, in each
case, for the period prior to the Closing, will  be  for the account of
Seller or TOPIII, and all items of income and expense,  including rents and
other charges under the Assigned Contracts, for the period  on and after the
Closing will be for the account of Purchaser, all as determined  by the
accrual method of accounting. If either Party actually receives any  rents 
or other charges under the Assigned Contracts that are, in whole or in part, 
designated as payments for the period credited to the other Party under this 
Section 5.6(b) "Income and Expenses," the recipient will, within a
reasonable  period of time, remit such amounts to the other Party.

(c) _Proration  Method_.  For  purposes of calculating prorations,
including the prorations described in  the  other subsections of this
Section 5.6 "Taxes, Prorations and Closing Costs," Purchaser will be deemed
to own the Assets, and, therefore, entitled to the  income therefrom and
responsible for the expenses thereof as of 10:00:01  a.m.  EST on the
Closing Date. All prorations will be made on the basis of the  actual 
number of days of the month which will have elapsed as of the Closing Date 
and  based upon a three hundred sixty-five day year. The amount of the
prorations  will be subject to adjustment in cash after the Closing, as and
when complete  and accurate information becomes available, and the Parties
agree to cooperate  and use their good faith efforts to make such
adjustments.

 

 

(d) _Governmental  Fees_.  Any  fees imposed by any Governmental Authority
related to or arising from operations  of the Assets (including fees relating
to air emissions pursuant to any Permit)  will be prorated between Purchaser
and Seller and TOPIII on the following  basis:  Seller and TOPIII are
responsible for the portion of such fees relating to  the  period up to the
Closing Date; and Purchaser is responsible for the portion  of  such fees
relating to the period on and after the Closing Date. All fees  will be 
prorated on the assumption that an equal amount of fees applies to each day 
of  the license period, regardless of how or when any installment payments
are  billed or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser will bear all
fees  which arise out of a change in ownership of the Assets, including the
transfer  of the governmental permits, licenses, Orders, variances, approvals
and  applications described in Schedule 2.1(d) "Permits," and all fees and
expenses  (including expenses related to or arising from the preparation of a
renewal  application, such as environmental consultants' fees) associated
with a renewal  of a license or permit where the expiration date occurs after
the Closing  Date.

 

 

(e) _Purchaser 's  Closing Costs_.  Purchaser will pay all costs and fees of
(i) Purchaser's Due Diligence  Inspections and Reviews, (ii) all costs of

of obtaining the approvals described in Section 5.3(a), (iii)  all  costs
incurred in obtaining Seller's Required Consents and TOPIII's Required 
Consents, (iv) the cost of the Title Policies and any endorsements to the 
Title  Policies reasonably requested by Purchaser, (v) the cost of obtaining
any  new  surveys or updates to existing surveys, and (vi) the cost of all
UCC, lien,  litigation, judgment or similar searches relating to the Assets,
except to  the  extent Seller has already paid for said searches in
connection with the issuance  of the Title Policies, and (vii) all fees of
Seller or TOPIII to negotiate  and  execute this Agreement and the Related
Agreements.

 

 

5.7 _No  Recourse_.  To the  extent the transfer, conveyance, assignment
and delivery of Assets to Purchaser  as provided in this Agreement is
accomplished by deeds, assignments,  sublicenses, subleases, subcontracts or
other instruments of transfer and  conveyance, whether executed at the
Closing or thereafter, these instruments  are  made without representation
or warranty by, or recourse against, the  transferring or conveying Party
except as expressly provided in this Agreement,  any Related Agreement or any
deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer  and conveyance.

all risk of loss  (including, without limitation, risk of an eminent domain

shall be  borne  by Seller and/or TOPIII.

 

 

(b) If,  after  the Effective Date but prior to 10:00 a.m. EST on the
Closing Date, all or  any  portion of the Assets (i) is taken by eminent
domain or condemnation or is  the  subject of a pending or threatened taking
or condemnation of which Seller  or  TOPIII becomes aware and which has not
been consummated, or (ii) has suffered  a  Casualty, Seller shall notify
Purchaser promptly in writing of such  fact:

 

 

(1) In  the  case of a Casualty, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith for  either a fair and equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price
or for Seller's  restoration (at Seller's sole expense) of the Assets to the
same quality and  condition such Assets were in prior to the Casualty; if
Purchaser and Seller  agree to restoration of the Assets in the event of a
Casualty, Purchaser  shall  have the right to observe, inspect and approve
the repairs necessitated by  such  Casualty. If no negotiated settlement is
reached within thirty (30) days  after  Seller has notified Purchaser of
such Casualty, Purchaser or Seller may  terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.14.

in Schedule 5.9 "Conduct of Business Not in the  Ordinary Course," or as
required under applicable law or by any Governmental  Authority, prior to the

5.17 _Employees_.

 

 

(a) Seller  shall terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, the employment
of all  employees listed on Schedule 3.19(a) "Seller's Employees," and shall
pay to  Seller's Employees all wages, salaries, commissions (if any) and
bonuses which  are due to them, including, without limitation, all unused
Paid Time Off  as  defined under Seller's policies accrued up to the Closing
Date. Purchaser agrees  to make an offer of employment to each of Seller's
Employees on or before the  Closing Date; provided, however, that any offer
of employment to, and any  employment by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
of, a Seller's Employee are  subject to all of Purchaser's and its
Affiliates', as applicable, standard  employment requirements. Each offer of
employment to a Seller's Employee shall  include base pay no less than the
base pay payable to such Seller's Employee as  set forth on Schedule 3.19(a),
and such employment shall have a principal  place  of work that is at the
Facility. Each of Seller's Employees who accepts such  offer of employment,
commences employment with Purchaser and satisfactorily  completes all of
Purchaser's standard employment requirements shall be  hereinafter referred
to as a "Transferred Employee." Unless otherwise agreed  between Purchaser
and a Transferred Employee, offers of employment shall  be on  an at-will
basis.

 

 

(b) Purchaser  shall (i) provide each Transferred Employee, for the one-year
period ending  on  the first anniversary of the Closing Date, a rate of base
pay that is no  less  than the rate of base pay set forth on Schedule
3.19(a) with respect to such  Transferred Employee and (ii) provide such
Transferred Employees (as a group)  during their employment with Purchaser
with employee benefit plans, programs  and  policies (other than equity-
based plans, programs or policies) that are  substantially similar in the
aggregate to those employee benefit plans, programs  and policies that are
maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates from time  to  time for the
benefit of similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its  Affiliates (any
such employee benefit plans, programs or policies of Purchaser  or its
Affiliates in which Transferred Employees become eligible to participate 
after the Closing Date shall be referred to hereinafter as, the "Purchaser 
Plans"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to 
provide the Transferred Employees with any benefits under any defined
benefit  pension plan or retiree medical plan of Purchaser that is frozen as
of the  Closing Date, unless otherwise required by law or the terms of any
such plan.  If  there are no similarly situated employees of Purchaser or
its Affiliates,  Purchaser shall provide such Transferred Employees (as a
group) with employee  benefit plans, programs and policies that are
substantially similar in the  aggregate to those of Seller, in which case
Seller hereby agrees to provide  Purchaser, upon written request, with any
information reasonably required  by  Purchaser in order for it to fulfill
such obligation. Neither Purchaser nor  Purchaser Plans shall receive assets
from, nor be required to assume any  liabilities of, the Benefit Plans.

 

 

(c) With  respect to Purchaser Plans, except to the extent otherwise required
by  applicable law, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

plan, waive,  or  cause the waiver of, any

exclusions  for pre-existing conditions and waiting periods for each
Transferred Employee  and his/her dependents to the extent that such pre-
existing condition exclusions  and waiting periods were previously satisfied
by such Transferred Employee  or  his/her dependents under the analogous
Benefit Plan in which such Transferred  Employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) with respect  to each such Purchaser Plan
that is a medical or health plan, provide each  Transferred Employee with
credit for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses  paid or incurred by
such Transferred Employee prior to his or her transfer  to  the Purchaser
Plan (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous  Benefit
Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately  prior  to
the Closing Date) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket 
requirements under such Purchaser Plan for the plan year that includes such 
transfer and (iii) recognize service of the Transferred Employees credited 
by  Seller and/or Sempra for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting  in  any Purchaser Plan in which the Transferred Employees' are
eligible to  participate after the Closing Date; provided, however that in no
event shall  the  Transferred Employees be entitled to any credit to the
extent that it would  result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of  service.

 

 

(d) Purchaser  shall provide severance benefits in an amount no less than
that described  in  Schedule 5.17(d) "Minimum Severance Benefit" to any
Transferred Employee who,  during the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the date which  is  twelve (12) months after the Closing Date:
(i) is terminated without cause;  or  (ii) elects to terminate his
employment with Purchaser within seven (7) days  after Purchaser notifies
such Transferred Employee of Purchaser's intent to (1)  reduce such
Transferred Employee's rate of base pay or (2) assign such  Transferred
Employee to a principal place of work that is different than  the  Facility.

 

 

(e) No  Seller's Employee who declines employment with Purchaser shall
receive a greater  severance benefit, if any, from Seller than said employee
would have received  had the offer of employment been accepted.

 

 

(f) In  accordance with the elections made pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of
the  Code by  Transferred Employees and to the extent permissible under
applicable law,  Seller  shall facilitate the transfer of assets held in the
respective accounts of  such  Transferred Employees from the Twin Oaks
Savings Plan to a plan or plans  designated by Purchaser. Purchaser agrees to
accept intact rollovers of the  cash  and loans associated with such
Transferred Employees' accounts.

 

 

(g) After  the  Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall have the right  to  meet with Seller's Employees from time to time to
discuss post-Closing  employment matters; provided, however, Purchaser shall
notify Seller at least  two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the
meeting is proposed  to be  held, and Seller shall have the right to have
one or more Seller's  Representatives (as defined below) attend such
meetings. If any written  materials are to be provided or used during a
meeting, Purchaser shall provide  copies of such written materials to Seller
at least two (2) Business Days  prior  to the meeting. For purposes of this
paragraph, "Seller's Representatives" shall  mean one or more representatives
of Seller but shall not include any of the  Seller's Employees. After the
Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date,  Seller covenants that it shall
(i) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to  retain  Seller's Employees, (ii)
allow Purchaser reasonable access to Seller's Employees  to discuss post-

attempt to make, directly or  indirectly, alternative employment offers to
Seller's Employees or otherwise  solicit or attempt to solicit Seller's
Employees for employment after the  Closing Date other than with Purchaser.

 

 

5.18 _Review  of Accounts Payable_.  If  Purchaser is responsible for
paying an account payable relating to the Assets  which becomes due and
payable after the Closing but relates to a pre-Closing  Date period, Seller
or TOPIII, as the case may be, shall provide copies of  such  accounts
payable to Purchaser.

 

 

5.19 _Advice  of Changes_.  Prior  to the Closing, each Party will advise
the other in writing with respect  to any  matter arising after the
Effective Date of which the applicable Party obtains  Knowledge and which, if
existing or occurring at the Effective Date, would  have  been required to
be set forth in any of the Schedules.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

(1) Any  Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee entitled to receive
indemnification  under this Agreement (an "Indemnitee") by a Party hereunder
(the "Indemnifying  Party") shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
mitigate all Indemnifiable  Losses, including availing itself of any
defenses, limitations, rights of  contribution, claims against Third Parties
and other rights at law or equity.  The Indemnitee's Commercially Reasonable
Efforts shall include the reasonable  expenditure of money to mitigate or
otherwise reduce or eliminate any loss  or  expenses for which
indemnification would otherwise be due, and, subject to  Section 8.2, the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnitee for the  Indemnitee's
reasonable expenditures in undertaking the mitigation.

 

 

(2) Any  Indemnifiable Loss shall be net of the dollar amount of any
insurance or  other  proceeds actually receivable by the Indemnitee or any
of its Affiliates with  respect to the Indemnifiable Loss to the extent
realized by the Indemnitee.  Any  party seeking indemnity hereunder shall
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts  to  seek coverage (including both costs
of defense and indemnity) under applicable  insurance policies with respect
to any such Indemnifiable Loss.

 

 

(3) An  Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnitee
under  Sections 8.1(a)(2) and 8.1(b)(2) until and unless the aggregate amount
of  Indemnifiable Losses equals or exceeds Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand  Dollars  ($2,500,000), whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for all  Indemnifiable Losses excluding the first Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand  Dollars ($2,500,000).

 

 

(4) The  respective indemnification obligations of Purchaser and of Seller
and TOPIII  (as  a group) under Sections 8.1(a)(2) and 8.1(b)(2),
respectively, and of  Purchaser's Parent and Seller's Parent under Sections
8.1(c)(2) and 8.1(d)(2),  respectively, shall not exceed Twenty-Five Million
Dollars ($25,000,000)  individually or in the aggregate (the "Indemnity
Cap").

 

 

(f) The  expiration or termination of any covenant, representation, warranty
or agreement  under this Agreement shall not affect the Parties' obligations
under this  Section if the Indemnitee provided the Indemnifying Party with
proper notice  of  the claim or event for which indemnification is sought
prior to such expiration  or termination.

 

 

(g) Except  to  the extent otherwise provided herein, the rights and
remedies of the Parties  under this Article 8 are exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights  and  remedies which the Parties may have under
this Agreement or otherwise for  monetary relief, with respect to (i) any
breach of or failure to perform  any  covenant, agreement, or representation
or warranty set forth in this Agreement,  or (ii) the Assumed Liabilities or
the Excluded Liabilities, as the case  may be.  The indemnification
obligations of the Parties set forth in this Article  8 apply  only to
matters arising out of this Agreement and the Related  Agreements.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, no Party (including an
Indemnitee) shall  be  entitled to recover from any other Party (including
an Indemnifying Party)  for  any Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement
any amount in excess of the  actual  compensatory damages, court costs and
reasonable attorney's and other advisor  fees suffered by

such  Party. Purchaser, Seller and TOPIII waive any right to recover from any
other  Party punitive, incidental, special, exemplary and consequential
damages  arising  in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or
the Related Agreements.  The provisions of this Section 8.1(h) shall not
apply to indemnification  for a  Third Party Claim.

 

 

8.2 _Defense  of Claims_.

 

 

(a) If  any  Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion or commencement of
any Third  Party  Claim with respect to which indemnification is to be
sought from an Indemnifying  Party, the Indemnitee shall give such
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice  thereof, but in any event such
notice shall not be given later than five  (5)  calendar days after the
Indemnitee's receipt of notice of such Third Party  Claim. Such notice shall
describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in  reasonable detail and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if practicable,  of  the Indemnifiable Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee.  The  Indemnifying
Party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written  notice to
the Indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense of any Third Party  Claim at
such Indemnifying Party's expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own 
counsel, provided that the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall
conduct  the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be reasonably
satisfactory to  the  Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party shall have full and
complete control over  the  conduct of such proceeding on behalf of the
Indemnitee and shall, in its  sole  discretion, have the right to decide all
matters of procedure, strategy,  substance and settlement relating to such
proceeding. The Indemnitee shall  cooperate in good faith in such defense at
such Indemnitee's own  expense.

 

 

(b) If,  within five (5) calendar days after an Indemnitee provides written
notice  to the  Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee
receives written  notice from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying
Party has elected  to  assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 8.2(a),  the  Indemnifying Party will not be liable for
any legal expenses subsequently  incurred by the Indemnitee in connection
with the defense thereof; provided,  however, that if the Indemnifying Party
fails to take reasonable steps necessary  to defend diligently such Third
Party Claim within thirty (30) calendar days  after receiving notice from the
Indemnitee that the Indemnitee believes the  Indemnifying Party has failed to
take such steps, the Indemnitee may assume  its  own defense and the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable  expenses thereof.

 

 

(1) Without  the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party shall  not  enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which
would lead to liability  or create any financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnitee  for  which the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. If a firm  offer is made to settle a Third Party
Claim without leading to liability  or the  creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnitee  for  which the Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder and the  Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying  party shall give written
notice to the Indemnitee to that effect. If the  Indemnitee fails to consent
to such firm offer within five (5) calendar days  after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved  of  its obligations to
defend such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee may contest  or defend such
Third Party Claim. In such event, the maximum liability of  the 
Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim will be the amount of such 
settlement offer.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

(c) The  Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense of any claim or
litigation,  except  with the consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed), consent to entry of judgment or
enter into any settlement  that provides for injunctive or other non-monetary
relief affecting the  Indemnitee.

 

 

(d) Any  claim  by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss which
does not result  from  a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by giving the  Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof,
stating the nature of such  claim in reasonable detail and indicating the
estimated amount, if practicable,  but in any event such notice shall not be
given later than five (5) calendar  days after the Indemnitee becomes aware
of such Direct Claim, and the  Indemnifying Party shall have a period of
twenty (20) calendar days within  which  to respond to such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not respond  within such twenty (20) calendar day
period, the Indemnitee shall issue a  second  notice to the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have a  period  of ten (10) calendar
days within which to respond to such second notice.  If the  Indemnifying
Party does not respond to the second notice within ten (10)  calendar days,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted  such  claim.
If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, the Indemnitee will  be free 
to seek enforcement of its right to indemnification under this  Agreement.

 

 

(e) If  the  amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the
making of  an  indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery,
settlement  or  otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any  claim,  recovery, settlement or payment by, from or against
any other entity, the  amount  of such reduction, less any costs, expenses
or premiums incurred in connection  therewith (together with interest thereon
from the date of payment thereof  at  the publicly announced Prime Rate
shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee  to  the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(f) A  failure  to give timely notice as provided in this Section 8.2 shall
not affect the  rights or obligations of any Party hereunder expect if, and
only to the extent  that, as a result of such failure, the Party which was
entitled to receive  such  notice was actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure.
