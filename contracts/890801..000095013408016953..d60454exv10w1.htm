Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent (including any required IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8), the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or wire transfer in the amount of U.S. dollars representing the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon surrender thereof the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration that the holders thereof have the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock or Company Options (if applicable) that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.6_ may paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Company Options (if applicable) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. 

   

 (d) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.8_, neither Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock or Company Options for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this  _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess 

  ##### 

  

    

of the amounts payable to Company stockholders or holders of Company Options
pursuant to this  _Article II_ shall promptly be paid to Parent. To the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Exchange Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this 
_Article II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Exchange Agent to make such payments contemplated by this  _Article
II_. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this _Section 2.8_ shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation, subject to _Section 2.8(e_), look only to the Surviving Corporation solely as general creditors for the cash constituting the Merger Consideration (which shall not accrue interest) pursuant to _Section 2.6(a_). 

   

 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in any Company Securities_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock and Company Options in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock and Company Options, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series A Preferred Stock and Company Options which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such cash constituting the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 2.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

   ##### 

  

 

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

 3.4 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.  

  

 (a) _SEC Filings_. Since January 1, 2005, the Company has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements, certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference) required to be filed by it with, or furnished to, the SEC (all such required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including those that the Company may file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "Company SEC Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance and complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports and the disclosure requirements of Rule 4350 of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, in each case, as in effect on the date such Company SEC Report was filed, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless corrected in a later filed Company SEC Report. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. The Company and each of its executive officers and directors are in compliance with, and have complied, in each case in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated under or pursuant to such act ("SOX"), and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 

  

 (b) _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "Company Financials"), including each Company SEC Report filed after the date hereof until the Closing: (i) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or 8-K under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly and accurately presented, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of the Companys operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (except that the unaudited interim financial statements were subject to normal and recurring year-end and quarter-end adjustments which were not material). The Company does not intend to correct or restate, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any basis, facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any correction or restatement of, any material aspect of the Company Financials. The audited balance sheet of the Company contained in the Company SEC Reports as of June 30, 2008, is hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet." The Company has not had any 

   ##### 

  

    

significant dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or
policies during any of its past five (5) full fiscal years or during the
current fiscal year-to-date. The books and records of the Company and each
Subsidiary have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the
Company Financials are consistent with such books and records. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose Person, on the other hand, including, without limitation,
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Reports. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have made appropriate disclosures in the Financial Statements in accordance
with the requirements of Financial Interpretation No. 48 of FASB Statement
No. 109. 

  

 (c) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of any nature that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries or described in the notes thereto which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except (i) Liabilities incurred since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice which are of the type which ordinarily recur and, individually or in the aggregate, are not material in nature or amount and do not result from any breach of Contract, tort or violation of any applicable Legal Requirement, and (ii) Liabilities arising under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Amendments_. The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which have not yet been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, but which are required to be filed or furnished, to agreements, documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by Company with the SEC, or furnished by the Company to the SEC, pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Since January 1, 2005, no "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) filed as an exhibit to the Company SEC Reports has been amended or modified, except for amendments or modifications which have been filed as an exhibit to a subsequently dated Company SEC Report. The Company has responded to all comment letters of the staff of the SEC relating to the Company SEC Reports, and the SEC has not advised the Company that any final responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. To the Companys knowledge, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comments. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, including all SEC comment letters and responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of the Company, since January 1, 2005. 

  

 (e) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions, receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being executed and made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Companys Board of Directors, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis and (B) to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 

   ##### 

  

    

timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iv) the amount recorded for assets on
the books and records of the Company is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. There are no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses"
(as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design
or operation of the Companys internal controls and procedures which could
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. To the Companys knowledge, there is no fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other current or former employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have a role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. The Company has established and
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the "principal executive officer" and the
"principal financial officer" of the Company required by Section 302 of the
SOX with respect to such reports, and such controls are effective for this
purpose. Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and
the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by

Prior to filing any Proxy Statement or any other filing with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment or 

    ##### 

  

 

supplement to the Proxy Statement as a result of any event or occurrence
required to be set forth therein), the Company shall provide Parent (which
term shall in all instances in this  _Section 6.1_ also include Parents
outside legal counsel whose review shall occur concurrently with Parents)
with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in
advance and the Company shall in good faith consider including in such filings
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. 

   

 (b) The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review the Proxy Statement or the issuance of any stop order) and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other filing or for additional/supplemental information, and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its advisers or representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or other filing with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

The Company agrees that it shall not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, permit or authorize any of its or any of its Subsidiaries officers, directors (or affiliates of any such officers or directors), employees, affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, or other agents, advisers or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage or facilitate, support or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal; (ii) participate or otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information or grant access to the Companys books, records or personnel with respect to, or take any other action (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_) to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to provide notification of or disclose the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.3(a)_); (iii) grant any person a waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (which provisions the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce), or approve a transaction (including any person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the Delaware Law); provided, that immediately upon any violation of this clause (iii), Parent shall automatically be released from its obligations under Addendum A to the Confidentiality Agreement without any further action by any party hereto; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_); or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment (whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and, upon Parents request, shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any Person with which the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives have engaged in any such activities within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date hereof. Any breach of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(a)_ by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Notification of Unsolicited Alternative Transaction Proposals_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for non-public information or any expression of interest or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of (A) the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, expression of interest or inquiry, (B) the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, expression of interest or inquiry, and (C) a copy of all material written materials provided by or on behalf of such Person or group in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, expression of interest or inquiry. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable with oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material respects of the status and details (including substantive modifications or proposed substantive modifications) of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, expression of interest or inquiry (including any negotiations contemplated by  _Section 6.3(c)(ii)_) and shall promptly provide Parent a copy of all written materials (including those provided by e-mail or otherwise in electronic format) amending any material terms and conditions subsequently provided by or to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request, expression of interest or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors could reasonably be expected to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal, including to consider whether such Alternative Transaction Proposal is a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 6.3(a)_, in the event that, prior to the time that Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal from a third party which is determined to be, or which the Companys Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of advice from and consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial adviser of national standing) is reasonably likely to become, a Superior Proposal, the Company may then take the following actions, but only if: (i) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving advice from and consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Delaware Law, and (B) the Company has given Parent prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following actions; and (ii) the Company shall have previously complied with the provisions of this _Section 6.3_: 

   

 (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such Alternative Transaction Proposal, _provided_ that (A) the Company shall have first received from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing (1) customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished to such third party on the Companys behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (2) a standstill provision, the term of which is at least as long as the term contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not include any provision having the actual or purported effect of restricting the Company from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to such third party, the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously so furnished); and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Transaction Proposal. 

  

 (d) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding _Section 6.2(b)_, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, solely in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, make a Change of Recommendation and, in the case of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event after which Parent does not timely deliver a Continuation Notice (as defined below), terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (v) are met: 

   

 (i) in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal; 

  

 (ii) the Company shall have (A) delivered to Parent written notice (a "Change of Recommendation Notice") at least three (3) Business Days prior to publicly effecting such Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event (and, if applicable, of its intention to terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal) which shall state expressly (1) that the Company has received a Superior Proposal or determined the existence of an Intervening Event, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, describe in reasonable detail the cause and factors constituting such Intervening Event, and (3) that the Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so; (B) provide to Parent a copy of all materials and information delivered or made available to the Person or group making the Superior Proposal in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent not previously delivered or made available to Parent), and (C) during the aforementioned three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Superior Proposal would no longer be a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, obviates the need for a Change of Recommendation; 

  

 (iii) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned three (3) Business Day period, made an offer that the Companys Board of Directors has in good faith determined (after the receipt of advice from and consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial adviser of national standing) results in the Alternative Transaction Proposal that had been determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, obviates the need for a Change of Recommendation; 

  

 (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice from and consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and after considering any adjustments or negotiations pursuant to the preceding clause (ii), that the Companys Board of Directors failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law; and 

  

 (v) the Company shall have previously complied with the provisions set forth in  _Section 6.2_ or this _Section 6.3_. 

  

 (e) _Continuing Obligation Regarding Company Stockholders  Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Alternative Transaction 

    ##### 

  

 

Proposal, or by any Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event of a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event,
Parent must notify the Company, within three (3) Business Days after such
Change of Recommendation (such notice, a "Continuation Notice"), that it
wishes the Board of Directors of the Company to submit this Agreement to the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with _Section 6.2(a)_ for
the purpose of adopting this Agreement and, if Parent does not deliver a
Continuation Notice within such period, the Company may, subject to and in
accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, terminate this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing proviso, the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 6.3(d)_. 

   

 (g) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any Subsidiary of the Company or any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 

   

 6.4 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.  

  

 (a) _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously executed a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of August 23, 2007 and amended on September 4, 2008 and September 10, 2008 (as amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) _Access to Information_. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access at all reasonable times on reasonable notice during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their properties, books, Contracts, commitments, assets (including the Company Intellectual Property, design processes and source code), personnel and records ( _provided_ , that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and, during such period and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws, and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on any press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and any Alternative Transaction Proposal and will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and (to the extent practicable) agreement or the content of such statement, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or any listing agreement with, in the case of Parent, the NYSE, and in the case of the Company, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or any other applicable national or regional securities exchange or market. The initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form agreed to by the parties. In addition, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1_ or prior communications consented to in accordance with this _Section 6.5_, the Company shall not issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning Parent or its business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirement, court process or by obligations pursuant to the Companys listing agreement with the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.5_ shall not apply to the matters set forth in  _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_. 

   

 6.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.  

  

 (a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that would impede compliance with, all Legal Requirements, and as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i) Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR Act, (ii) filings under any other comparable pre-merger notification forms reasonably determined by Parent to be required by the merger notification or control laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto, and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country, or any other Legal Requirement relating to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under this  _Section 6.6(a)_ to comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

 (b) _Exchange of Information_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_. Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall consult with the other prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing, shall permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under any antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement), coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other and/or its counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any 

    ##### 

  

 

Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby,  _provided_ that with respect to any such filing,
presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply
the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in the case of oral presentations,
a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be agreed in connection with any
joint defense agreement executed between counsel for Parent and counsel for
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will not be required to share
with each other any documents covered by Item 4(c) of filings prepared in
connection with the HSR Act. 

   

 (c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to  _Section 6.6(a)_, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. 

   

 (d) _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of _Section 6.2_ and  _Section 6.3_ hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (e) _Antitrust Restraints_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of its affiliates or 

    ##### 

  

 

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation
or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to freely
conduct their business or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the
shares of Company capital stock or any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company capital stock (any of the foregoing, an
"Antitrust Restraint"). 

   

 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.  

  

 (a) _By the Company_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied; (ii) the occurrence of any Material Adverse Effect or any event or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied; and (iii) any claim, action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding or investigation by or before any court, arbitrator or arbitration panel, board or Governmental Entity, initiated by or against it, or known by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders in their capacity as such. 

   

 (b) _By Parent_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied. 

   

 6.8 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including all consents, waivers and approvals set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. In connection with seeking such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all developments material to the obtaining of such consents, waivers and approvals, and shall, at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought hereunder. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall not have any liability to the Company, its stockholders or any other Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver any notices required under any of its or its Subsidiaries respective Contracts that are required to be provided in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 6.9 _Employee Matters_.  

  

 (a) _Termination of Company Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company Purchase Plans shall be terminated. The rights of participants in each Company Purchase Plan with respect to any offering period then underway under such Company Purchase Plan shall be determined by treating the last Business Day prior to, or if more administratively advisable, the last payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the Effective Time, as the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but 

    ##### 

  

 

otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under such Company Purchase Plan.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including,
if appropriate, amending the terms of such the Company Purchase Plan) that
are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this 
_Section 6.9(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan"), unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or such ERISA Affiliate, its Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be provided or such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval by Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such charges and/or fees shall the responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) _Consultation on Employee Communications_. The Company will consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any material notices or other communication materials to its employees regarding the matters described in this  _Section 6.9_ and any other matters relating to the entry into of this Agreement or the effects of the Merger. 

   

 (d) _Employment Matters_. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide the employees of the Company who are employed by Parent, or a subsidiary of Parent, after the Closing Date (the "Continuing Employees") with comparable types and levels of employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plan and equity award, change of control and severance benefits) ("Parent Plans"), as those provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent. To the extent such employee benefits are provided through Parent Plans and not the Company Employee Plans, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any Parent Plan and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule, Parent shall provide that the Continuing Employees shall receive service credit under the Parent Plans for their period of service with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing, except where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits. If the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2008 and such benefits are provided under Parent Plans, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plan that is a group health plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents in accordance with applicable laws and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan year including the Closing Date for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent Plan in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, as a precondition to Parents obligation to provide such credit, the administrator of the relevant Parent Plans shall have first received a complete and accurate listing of such expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees from January 1, 2008 (or, if earlier, the first day of the applicable plan year) through the date on which their 

    ##### 

  

  

participation in any such Parent Plan commences. Nothing contained in this 
_Section 6.9_ shall alter the "at-will" status of any of the U.S. employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 6.10 _Indemnification_.  

  

 (a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to and to the extent of any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed in _Section 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, subject to applicable law, and (ii) until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to and to the extent of any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, in each case, with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time or such longer period as is required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by applicable Legal Requirements, or unless proper provision is made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company covering those persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for events occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company for a period of six (6) years; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 200% of such annual premium); and _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.10(b)_ by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii) contains terms and conditions (including, without limitation, coverage amounts) that are no less advantageous, when taken as a whole, to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company, and (iv) the cost of which to Parent or the Surviving Corporation does not exceed an amount equal to 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company (and, to the extent such costs exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain the maximum amount of "tail" coverage as is available for 200% of such annual premium). 

   

 (c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 6.10_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. 

     ##### 

 

   

 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Company Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by _Article II_ of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.12 _No Modification of Representations, Warranties, Covenants or Agreements_.

Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, _provided_ , that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, including the NASDAQ Global Select Market, requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and 

   ##### 

  

 

the Company and duly approved by the parties respective Boards of Directors
or a duly designated committee thereof.

herein shall not be used as a benchmark for any determination of what is or

parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. 

   

 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission or by electronic mail with a pdf scanned attachment) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and other Exhibits hereto (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in  _Section 6.10_. 

  

 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 9.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal Court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or equity.

   ##### 

  

 

or proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable,
such Federal court); (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (and, if applicable, such Federal court); and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, such Federal
court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the
right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by law. 

   

 9.9 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section 9.9_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
