Affiliates and any such termination would result in no Liability to the Company or any ERISA

labor disputes or grievances pending or threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor
matters involving any Employee, including charges of unfair labor practices. Neither the Company

National Labor Relations Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is presently, nor
has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to, bound by or subject to any labor-related agreement or arrangement with any foreign works

defined benefit pension plan and equity award, change of control and severance benefits) (&#147;<B>Parent

benefits are provided through Parent Plans and not the Company Employee Plans, for purposes of

applicable break in service or similar rule, Parent shall provide that the Continuing Employees
shall receive service credit under the Parent Plans for their period of service with the Company

pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods
