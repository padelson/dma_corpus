 _ _Section 2.02 Effective Time; Closing__. As promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than the third business day after the satisfaction or written
waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,

as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger (or
such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified
in the Certificate of Merger) being the " _Effective Time_ "). Immediately
prior to such filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the " _Closing_

the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (the date of the Closing, the "
_Closing Date_ ").

__Section 2.03__ __Effect of the Merger__. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

__Section 2.04__ __Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws__. (a) At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as

that, at the Effective Time, _Article I_ of the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is SeaBright Holdings, Inc." 

(b) At the Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving

Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
will include the provisions required by _Section 6.06(b)_.

 

 _ _Section 2.05__ __Directors and Officers__. The directors and officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly

resignation or removal.

__Section 2.06__ __Conversion of Securities__. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_ and other than any Dissenting Shares and shares
of Company Restricted Stock) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount in Cash equal to $11.11 per
share of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable,
without interest, to the holder of such share of Company Common Stock, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 2.11_ of the certificate that
formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock or such share of Company
Common Stock in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred
to herein, to the extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ").

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries or any Company
Subsidiary shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 _ _Section 2.07__ __Employee Stock Options__. Effective as of the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (i) to terminate the
Companys Second Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Option Plan and the Companys
Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Plan, each as amended through the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Incentive Plans_ "), (ii) to provide that each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under
the Company Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested or exercisable, as of such
date shall become fully vested and exercisable and (iii) so that, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any Company Stock Options, each outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, with
respect to each share of Company Common 

 



9  Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, only an amount in Cash equal to
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option, less any Taxes required to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.11(c)_ (the " _Option Payment_ ").
Parent shall provide the Surviving Corporation with Cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Option Payments as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall make
each such Option Payment as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in any event, no later than five business days after the Effective Time.
The Company shall take all necessary action to approve the cancellation and
payment in respect of the Company Stock Options by virtue of the Merger to the
extent necessary to exempt any such deemed dispositions and acquisitions
under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Incentive Plans that are subject to forfeiture immediately prior to

outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock shall be canceled and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
less any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.11(c)_
(the " _Restricted Stock Payment_ "). Parent shall provide the Surviving
Corporation with Cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of
the Restricted Stock Payments as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. The Surviving Corporation shall make each such Restricted Stock Payment
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event, no
later than five business days after the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all necessary action to approve the cancellation and payment in respect
of the Restricted Stock by virtue of the Merger to the extent necessary to
exempt any such deemed dispositions and acquisitions under Rule 16b-3 of the
Exchange Act.

__Section 2.09__ __Restricted Stock Units__. Effective as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any restricted stock units granted
under the Company Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company RSU_ "), each Company
RSU that is outstanding, whether or not vested, shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive only an amount in Cash
equal to the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with  _Section 2.11(c)_ (the " _RSU Payment_ "). Parent shall
provide the Surviving Corporation with Cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of the RSU Payments as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall make each such RSU Payment as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event, no later
than five business days after the Effective Time. The Company shall take all
necessary action to approve the cancellation and payment in respect of the
Company RSUs by virtue of the Merger to the extent necessary to exempt any
such deemed dispositions and acquisitions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act.

 

 _ _Section 2.10__ __Dissenting Shares__. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock that are cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.06(b)_)
and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of
the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the 

 



10  DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders shall only be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common
Stock under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 2.11_, of the Certificate or
Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock. 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or agree or
commit to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

 

 _ _Section 2.11__ __Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books__. (a) Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
(reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the holders of the Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger
Sub shall enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates, Cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid in accordance with this Agreement (such Cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by the Parent solely in Cash and Treasury Bills. Any
interest or other amounts received with respect to such investments shall be
paid to Parent. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.

(b) Promptly, but in any event within 5 days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of a Certificate entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_ a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter
of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate,
and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate. Until satisfaction of the terms set forth in this _Section
2.11_, each Certificate shall be

 



11  deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive, upon satisfaction of the applicable procedures and surrender of the
Certificate to the Paying Agent, the Merger Consideration pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. If the payment
equal to the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable.

(c) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock), Company RSUs or Company Stock Options, as the case may be,
such amount or amounts as it reasonably believes is the minimum it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
and properly paid to the relevant Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Stock), Company RSUs or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(d) At any time following the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Certificates two years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock

 



12  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_.

__Section 2.12__ __Adjustments__. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify, exchange or adjust the Company Common Stock, or pay a
stock dividend or other stock distribution in Company Common Stock, or
otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any other securities, or make
any other such stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of the Company
in respect of the Company Common Stock (it being understood that the Company
shall only be permitted to take any of the foregoing actions to the
extent permitted under _Section 5.01_), then the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect to any Company
Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock or Company RSU will be appropriately
and proportionately adjusted to reflect such split, combination,
reclassification, exchange, adjustment, dividend or other distribution or
change.

concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, it being
acknowledged and agreed by Parent that any matter set forth in any section or
subsection of the Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosure for all
sections and subsections of the Disclosure Letter to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent on the face thereof, but will expressly not be deemed to
constitute an admission by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or otherwise

and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such corporate power or
authority would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so

interest in, any person.

necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to, in the case
of the consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, obtaining the Stockholder Approval
and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by

general equitable principles (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). The
Company Board has approved this Agreement and the Transactions and such
approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL shall not apply to the

the Transactions. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control
shares acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover

filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, statements
and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,

incorporated by reference therein, (i) complied, in all material respects,
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Company Subsidiary is required to file or furnish any forms, reports,
statements or other documents with the SEC. The Company has provided or made
available to Parent copies of all correspondence sent to or received from the
SEC by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective counsel or

each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-

permitted or contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the Company SEC Reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



18 (e) The Company maintains a standard system of accounting established and
administered in accordance with GAAP. The Company and the Company

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. Management of the Company
has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board and on _Section 3.07(e)_ of the Disclosure Letter (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, in each case
that are within the knowledge of the Company based upon its most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of
this Agreement.

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
Liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or other
Company SEC Reports.

(g) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made
all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")
with respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding
(nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company is otherwise in compliance with all applicable

constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

past practice and (b) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect. Since

3.09_ of the Disclosure Letter, there is no litigation, suit, claim, action,

Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any executive officer or director of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in their capacities as such, before any Governmental
Authority; provided, however, that solely for the purpose of this _Section
3.09_ the term Action does not include litigation, suits, claims, actions,

Subsidiary, in each case, that will bind the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for any taxable period ending after the date of the Closing. Neither the

to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the

Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

35  Incorporation or By-laws or other organizational documents of either Parent
or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and other
authorizations described in Section 4.03(b) have been obtained and that all

taken, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or
by which any property or asset of either of them is bound or subject, or
(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or require any consent, approval or other action of any person under, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or
by which Parent or Merger Sub or any property or asset of either of them is
bound or subject, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay

from performing its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not, and

(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), and (v) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations, permits or licenses, or to make such
filings, declarations, registrations or notifications, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Transactions, or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing
its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 _ _Section 4.04_ _Legal Proceedings__. Except insofar as do not, and as would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions, or otherwise prevent Parent
or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this Agreement, (i) there
are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened Actions against
Parent or any of its subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority and (ii)
none of Parent, its subsidiaries or any their property or assets is subject to
any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar
written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority.

Parent Disclosure Letter, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled
to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub.

__Section 4.08__ __Information Supplied.__ The information supplied in
writing by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will not, at
the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
such portions of the Proxy Statement that relate expressly to the Company or
any of its affiliates or to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

 _ _Section 4.09__ __No Other Representations or Warranties.__ Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of Parent or
Merger Sub, or any other person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, makes any

_Stockholders  Meeting_, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all shares of
Company Common Stock then owned by them and their subsidiaries to

 



40  be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any Superior Proposal, unless the Transactions have been
consummated or the Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section
8.01_, the obligations of the Company under this _Section 6.01_ shall
continue in full force and effect.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.04_, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement.

__Section 6.02__ __Proxy Statement_. _(a) As promptly as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall file a preliminary proxy
statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection with
the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement together with, as the context
dictates, any ancillary documents to be sent to such stockholders, each as
amended or supplemented, being referred to herein as the " _Proxy Statement_
") with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly
as practicable. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each
other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Parent promptly
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any representative of the
Company and the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall give Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to such
documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, and shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent
to, the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other parties
hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC
and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and
supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest reasonably
practicable time. Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto, including supplying information for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or filing information
required by the Exchange Act or requested by the SEC in a timely manner.

to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of the Company
Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders
(other than Parent and its subsidiaries). Except to the extent permitted by
_Section 6.04_, the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



41 __Section 6.03__ __Access to Information; Confidentiality__. (a) From the
date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and
agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford the officers,
employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal
business hours, on reasonable notice, to the officers, employees, offices,
books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, and shall
promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent or Merger Sub, through its officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request. The foregoing shall not require
the parties to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company could reasonably be expected to result
in (i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or the violation
of any obligations of the Company with respect to confidentiality or non-
disclosure existing prior to the date of this Agreement or that is entered
into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business, (ii)
the waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege or (iii) the violation
of any applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use reasonable best efforts to (x)
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, confidentiality obligation or risk
waiver of such privilege, and (y) seek to obtain the required consent of any
third party to provide such access or disclosure.

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 6.03_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the letter
agreement, dated March 29, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between
Parent and the Company.

__Section 6.04__ __No Solicitation of Transactions__. (a) The Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, advisors and
representatives to, (i) immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, seek to
have returned to the Company (or destroyed) any confidential information that
has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations and (ii) take such
action as is reasonably necessary to enforce any standstill or similar
agreement to which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary, unless in
the case of subsection (ii) the Company Board reasonably determines based on
the advice of outside counsel that taking such action would reasonably be
expected to cause the Company Board to breach its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. From the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it
permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
officers, directors, employees or affiliates, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts not to permit any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it or any Company Subsidiary
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly take any other
action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve any transaction under, or any third party
becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
that if, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, following
the receipt of a Takeover Proposal that is or is reasonably expected to lead
to a

 



42  Superior Proposal that in either case was unsolicited and made after the
date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this _Section 6.04_,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that a failure to do so would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company Board to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company
may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, subject to compliance with
_Section 6.04(c)_, and, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) that follow, upon
three business days advance notice to Parent, (A) request information from the
party making such Takeover Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board
informing itself about the Takeover Proposal that has been made and the party
that made it, (B) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to the party making such Takeover Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, provided, that (1) such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or having the effect of
prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement
and (2) the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after
providing such information to any person) provide to Parent all such nonpublic
information delivered to such person (to the extent not previously provided
or made available to Parent) after its delivery to the requesting party, and
(C) participate in discussions and negotiations with such party regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) Except as permitted in this _Section 6.04(b)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold or withdraw (or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withhold or
withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend for approval, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend for approval, any Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the
Company Common Stock within 10 business days after the commencement of such
offer, (iv) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation, or (v) resolve to take any of the foregoing actions (any of
(i) through (v), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (vi) cause
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a customary
confidentiality agreement referred to in clause (B) of the proviso to
_Section 6.04(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Company Board determines in good faith, in response to a Takeover Proposal
(that was not solicited in breach of _Section 6.04(a)_) that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, which was made after the date hereof, but prior to the
receipt of the Stockholder Approval, in circumstances not involving a breach
of this Agreement, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (subject to
compliance with this sentence and to compliance with  _Section 6.04(a)_ and
_Section 6.04(c)_) take any or all of the following actions: (x) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement and approve such transaction or the acquirer being an
"interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL, or (z) postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that (1) any actions described
in clause (x), (y) or (z) may be taken only at a time that is after the third
business day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company
(such period of time, the " _Notice Period_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and including the most current
version of the proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt
basis), 

 



43  identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and providing notice of
the determination of the Company Board of what actions described in clause
(x), (y) or (z) the Company Board has determined to take; (2) the action
described in clause (y) may be taken only upon compliance by the Company with
_Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ and _Section 8.03_; (3) the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, advisors
and representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in
good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it
being agreed that in the event that, after the commencement of the Notice
Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal,
including any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if
applicable, to ensure that at least two business days remain in the Notice
Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such
material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions
of the Notice Period)); and (4) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal taking
into account, among other things, the payment of the Termination Fee and any
adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. In addition, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may also make an Adverse
Recommendation Change as contemplated by clause (i) of the definition of "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ," if it determines in good faith that a
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Company has given
Parent three business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.04(a)_ and _Section 6.04(b)_, the Company shall promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) advise Parent orally (and in writing as
promptly as reasonably practicable) of any initial request for confidential
information in connection with a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or the Takeover
Proposal and shall keep Parent advised as promptly as reasonably practicable
of all material developments which could reasonably be expected to culminate
in the Company Board making an Adverse Recommendation Change or exercising any
of its other rights under _Section 6.04(a)_ or _(b)_. The Company agrees
that it will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person
subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.04(c)_.

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_ or  _Section 6.10_ shall
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or, if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
disclose such position or communication could constitute a violation of
applicable Law, from making any other disclosure to the
Companys stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, except in accordance with _Section 6.04(b)_ and
_further provided_  that in no event shall any "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-1(f) under the
Exchange Act be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or violate
_Section 6.04_.

(i) " _ _Takeover Proposal__ " means any inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates
or representatives) relating to, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase (pursuant
to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction) of 15% or
more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries)
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to which 15% or
more of the Companys net revenue or net income on a consolidated basis are
attributable, or 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company, or
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company, other than the Transactions.

 

(ii) " _ _Superior Proposal__ " means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that was not solicited in violation of _Section 6.04(a)_ from any person for
a direct or indirect acquisition or purchase (pursuant to a merger,

liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction) of 50% or more of the
consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to which 50% or more of
Companys net revenue or net income on a consolidated basis are attributable,
or 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company, or any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company
(other than the Transactions), which, considering all relevant factors
(including whether financing for such Takeover Proposal is fully committed or
reasonably likely to be obtained) the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after receiving the advice of the Companys financial advisor
and outside counsel), is more favorable to the Company and its stockholders
than the Merger.

__Section 6.05__ __Employee Benefits Matters__. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to
honor in accordance with their terms, the contracts, agreements,
arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that this _Section 6.05_ shall under no
circumstances confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement the rights
of a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, constitute or be deemed to
constitute an amendment to any such contracts, agreements, arrangements,
policies, plans or commitments, or interfere with or limit Parents, the
Surviving Corporations or its subsidiaries right to amend or terminate any
such contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans or commitments in
accordance with their terms. In addition, Parent shall grant employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary credit for all periods of employment
with the Company and any Company Subsidiary for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any 

 



45  employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for service accrued or
deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in the duplication
of benefits.

 

 _ _Section 6.06__ __Directors  and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance__. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
fines, liabilities or judgments, including any amounts that are paid in
settlement with the prior written approval of the Surviving Corporation (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection
with any Action based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or
omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
Surviving Corporations right to assume the defense of any Action as provided
below, the Surviving Corporation will pay all expenses of each Indemnified
Party as incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to
the fullest extent permitted by Law to advance such expenses upon receipt of
an undertaking from the Indemnified Party to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 6.06_, upon learning of any such
Action shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify
the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any
liability which it may have under this _Section 6.06_ except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation), and
shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking of the kind
described above. In the event any Action is brought against any Indemnified
Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) or an Indemnified
Party is required to be a witness in any Action: (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and
upon such assumption the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not
to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably
advises the Indemnified Parties that there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (ii) except to
the extent otherwise required due to conflicts of interest, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties unless there is a conflict of
interest that necessitates more than one law firm, and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any Action effected
without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



46 (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set
forth in Article SEVEN of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, which provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of the Indemnified
Parties, unless such modification is required by applicable Law, and then
only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers
with comparable credit ratings, as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
and covering the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company pay more than 250% of the current annual premium payable by
the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by
this _Section 6.06(c)_ for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum
Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
Maximum Amount; and immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide for the current officers and directors of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries who become directors or officers of the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing to be covered under the
Surviving Corporations directors and officers liability program with the
same terms as those applicable to the other officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries.

 

(d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_. 

(e) This _Section 6.06_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties, and will be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.06_. 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be construed to waive or
impair the rights of any director or officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to make a claim under any directors and officers liability
insurance that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.06_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such insurance.

 



47 __Section 6.07__ __Notification of Certain Matters__. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event, change or effect which
causes or which reasonably would be expected to cause, in the case of notice
by the Company, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(c)_, and in the case of notice by the Parent, the
failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_, (b) any material
breach by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and (c) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is
or may be required in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
6.07_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice; and provided further that a failure to comply
with this _Section 6.07_ will not constitute a breach of this Agreement or
the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied
unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_
to be satisfied.

 

 _ _Section 6.08__ __Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts__. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall (i) make promptly (and in any event within 10 business days of
the date hereof) its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal
or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger
and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger, including, using its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all
Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders
of Governmental Authorities (including the approval of the California
Department of Insurance and the Illinois Department of Insurance
(collectively, the " _Form A Approvals_ ") and approval or non-disapproval
within the statutory waiting period of any Form E pre-acquisition
notification filings that are required by applicable Law (collectively, the "
_Form E Approvals_ ")) and parties to contracts with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and
to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all
consents, approvals and authorizations necessary with respect to any Leased
Real Property. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to file or submit
applications for the Form A Approvals no later than September 14, 2012 and all
notification filings required for the Form E Approvals within 20 business
days after the date hereof and to respond promptly to any request by any
Governmental Authority for any additional information and documentary material
in connection therewith. Parent shall give the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity, if practicable, to review and comment on any non-
confidential filings or submittals made in connection with the Form A
Approvals and the Form E Approvals, and all amendments or supplements thereto
prior to their being filed or submitted. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly forward to the other all notices, inquiries and other written
communications received by it from any Governmental Authority relating to the
Transactions. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to defend in good
faith against any actions, suits or proceedings in which either party or its
subsidiaries is named as defendant which seeks to enjoin, restrain or prohibit
the Transactions. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take all such action. Subject to _Section
6.04_ and the termination rights provided in _Article VIII_ , none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall until the Effective Time, directly or
indirectly, take any action or fail to take any action that is intended to, or
that would reasonably be likely to, materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



48 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 6.08(a)_
or any other section of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company may not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or
agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material
assets, business or portion of a business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, or
(ii) impose any material restriction, requirement or limitation on the
operation of the business or portion of the business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries, other than any restriction, requirement or limitation that
imposes upon Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Insurance Subsidiary an
obligation to seek written permission from the applicable Insurance
Regulators prior to the Surviving Corporation or the Insurance Subsidiary
paying any dividends for a period of three (3) years following Closing.

 

 _ _Section 6.09__ __Public Announcements__. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree that, other than as contemplated by ___Section 6.04 ___, no
public release or announcement concerning this Agreement shall be issued by
either party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or
non-United States securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

Company hereby waives the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as and
to the extent necessary to permit the consummation of the Merger.

__Section 6.11__   _ _Section 16 Matters__. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Award pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

__Section 6.12__   _ _Anti-Takeover Laws__. If any "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law is or may
become applicable to the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall
grant such approvals and take such reasonable actions as are within their
power so as to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the
Transactions.

 



49 __Section 6.13__ __Delisting__. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with

__Section 6.14__ __Financing__. Upon request of Parent, the Company shall and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective advisors and representatives, to
reasonably assist Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the arrangement of
all or a portion of the funding in connection with the Transactions (the " _
__Financing ___"); provided, that such requested cooperation and assistance
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, such
cooperation by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
advisors and representatives shall include, at the reasonable request
of Parent, (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings and
presentations with prospective Financing Sources (including using commercially
reasonable efforts to make available the Companys senior management for
participation in such meetings), (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts
to provide information, in connection with the Financing, (iii) furnishing the

using commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the preparation of one or
more confidential information memoranda and other marketing and syndication
materials reasonably requested by Parent and (v) using commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in procuring any necessary rating agency ratings or
approvals. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos in
connection with the Financing, provided that such use is disclosed to the
Company in writing prior to the time that it is so used, such logos are used
in a manner that could not reasonably be expected to harm or disparage the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their marks and on such other customary
terms and conditions as the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary
shall reasonably impose. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this
Agreement, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and

under this  _ __Section 6.14 ___. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall

definitive agreement or incur any other liability or obligation in connection
with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. All material non-public
information provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their advisors or representatives pursuant to this _ __Section 6.14
___shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose
such information to the Financing Sources and ratings agencies during

8.03(b)(v)_, all references to 15% in the definition of "Takeover Proposal"
shall be replaced with references to 50%), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee, less the amount of any Expenses previously
reimbursed by the Company to Parent under subsection (iii) above, within two
business days of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Takeover Proposal; or

 



54 (vi) if (A) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.01(c)(i)_, (B) prior to the time of such termination (or in the 12 months
after the time of such termination in the event of a termination on account of
a breach of _Section 6.04_ or _Section 6.02(a)_) a Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly announced with respect to the Company, and (C) within 12
months after the date of such termination (or 12 months after the announcement
of the Takeover Proposal in the case of a termination on account of a breach
of _Section 6.04_ or _Section 6.02(a)_) the Company consummates a
transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal (whether or not such Takeover
Proposal was the same Takeover Proposal referenced in clause (B)) (
_provided_ that for purposes of this _Section 8.03(b)(vi)_, all references to
15% in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be replaced with references
to 50%), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two
business days of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Takeover Proposal.

(c) If Parent or the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement and
Parent is entitled to receive a Termination Fee, receipt by Parent of such
Termination Fee in full will constitute liquidated damages and be the sole and
exclusive remedy against the Company, its officers, directors, employees,
agents, affiliates, and representatives regardless of the circumstances of
such termination, except in cases of fraud. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be
payable under more than provision of this Agreement, at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

 

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions.

hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
following receipt of the Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made that
would require further approval of the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law without such further approval; provided, further that the
consent of the Financing Sources shall be required for any amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of this  _ __Section 8.04 ___or of _
__Section 9.04 ___, _ __Section 9.06 ___, _ __Section 9.08 ___and _
__Section 9.09 ___to the extent such amendment, supplement, modification or

56 __Section 9.02__ __Severability__. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination
will have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision and
this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. In the event such court does not exercise the power
granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

__Section 9.03_ _Entire Agreement; Assignment_._ This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, all Schedules and the Disclosure Letter,
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes, except as set forth in _Section 6.03(b)_ and
_Section 6.10_, all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of Law or otherwise), except that either of Parent and Merger Sub
may (in its sole discretion) assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

__Section 9.04_ _Parties in Interest__. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto (and their successors
and permitted assigns) and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person (including any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than (a) _Section 6.06_ (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons)
and (b) _Section 8.04_, _Section 9.04_, _Section 9.06(b)_, _Section 9.08_
and _Section 9.09_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Financing Sources).

__Section 9.05_ _Specific Performance__. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
on a timely basis or were otherwise breached, and that the parties, without
the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Agreement
and to specific performance of the terms hereof to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the other parties hereto agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that there is an adequate
remedy available at law. Except as expressly provided herein, the

 



57  rights, obligations and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative
and in addition to any other rights, obligations and remedies otherwise
available at law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing
herein will be considered an election of remedies.

__Section 9.06_ _Governing Law__. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the Transactions hereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action
except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to venue of any such action or proceeding in
such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of any inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably consents
to service of process in any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 9.01_ of this Agreement; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in  _Section 9.06(a)_ to the contrary, each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Action
(whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). The provisions of this _Section 9.06(b)_ shall be
enforceable by each Financing Source, its affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

__Section 9.07_ _Non-Survival of Representation, Warranties and Agreements__.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements, will survive the
Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and
therein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the termination of this Agreement or after the Effective Time, as the
case may be.

 



58 __Section 9.08_ _Waiver of Jury Trial__. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS OR THE FINANCING. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE MERGER, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.08_.

 

 _ _Section 9.09_ _Financing Sources__. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Financing Sources shall not have any
liability to the Company or those affiliates of the Company under its control
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether at Law or equity, in
contract or in tort or otherwise, and the Company and those affiliates of
the Company under its control shall not have any rights or claims, and shall
not seek any loss or damage or any other recovery or judgment of any kind,
including direct, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, against any
Financing Source under this Agreement, whether at Law or equity, in contract
or in tort or otherwise.

__Section 9.10_ _Interpretation and Rules of Construction__. In this
Agreement, except to the extent otherwise provided or that the context
otherwise requires: (a) when a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, sub-Section or Schedule, such reference is to the

Agreement unless otherwise indicated; (b) the headings for this Agreement are

Agreement; (e) the term "executive officer" has the meaning given to such
term in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act; (f) all terms defined in this
Agreement have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other

rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against
the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. No summary of this Agreement prepared by or
on behalf of any party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



59 __Section 9.11_ _Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile and other means of electronic transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
