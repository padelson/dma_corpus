HCC nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is directly or indirectly a party or subject to any Order which restricts the conduct of its business, imposes any requirements or procedures, or in any material manner relates
to its capital adequacy, its liquidity and funding policies and practices, its ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance policies, its internal controls, its management or its operations or business. None of HCC or any of
its Subsidiaries has received at any time since December&nbsp;31, 2015, any written notice or other written communication whether from any Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Order. Except
for normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the business of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries, no Governmental Entity has initiated since December&nbsp;31, 2015, or has pending any Legal Action before, or, to
the knowledge of HCC, any inquiry, examination or investigation by, any Governmental Entity into the business or operations, policies, practices or disclosures of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of HCC, threatened any of the
foregoing. There is no material unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Governmental Entity as to any report or statement relating to any examination of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither HCC or HBC has been informed that its status
as &#147;well-capitalized,&#148; or &#147;well managed&#148; will change within the next 12 months. No matter described in Section&nbsp;4.13 of the HCC Disclosure Schedule has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

ability of the parties to obtain any approval of any Governmental Entity required for the Contemplated Transactions or to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement. To the knowledge of HCC, no event has occurred and no circumstances
exists that are reasonably likely to (a)&nbsp;cause the approvals that are required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity having approval authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions not be granted, (b)&nbsp;cause such
Governmental Entity approvals to be subject to a condition which would differ from conditions customarily imposed by a Governmental Entity in orders approving acquisitions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or (c)&nbsp;make any of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of HCC and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Contemplated Transactions unlikely to be fulfilled within the applicable time period or periods required for satisfaction of such condition or conditions. Without
limitation of the foregoing, HBC and HCC will be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; for regulatory purposes following consummation of the Contemplated Transaction, and to the knowledge of HCC, consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not require
HCC or HBC to raise capital or otherwise secure any financing commitments from any third-parties or require any financing contingencies. </P>

remedy for any such breach and that Director will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that HCC and HBC has an adequate remedy at law. Director submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action. In addition, HCC and HBC

the provisions of <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;3, Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;4 or Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;5 (as applicable)</U> shall be deemed amended to apply to the maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range of activities or subjects
as to which such provision shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality
