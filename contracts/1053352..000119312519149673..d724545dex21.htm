ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and pursuant to the provisions of the California
General Corporation Law (" _CGCL_ ") and, to the extent applicable, the
California Financial Code (" _CFC_ ") and the rules and regulations
promulgated by the California Department of Business Oversight (" _DBO_ "),
at the Effective Time, Presidio shall merge with and into HBC (the " _Merger_
") and the separate corporate existence of Presidio shall cease. HBC shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.02 _Effective Time_. On the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth (5th)
business day after which each of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ of
this Agreement has been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at Closing) or such other time
as the parties may mutually agree, at the offices of Buchalter, a Professional
Corporation, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time (the " _Closing Date_ "). On or
before the Closing Date, Presidio and HBC will file, or cause to be filed,
with the DBO and the California Secretary of State an agreement of merger in
substantially the form of  _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ to this Agreement. The Merger
shall become effective at the time that such agreement of merger has been
filed with the DBO as provided in Section 4887(b) of the CFC (the " _Effective
Time_ "). 

Section 1.03 _Effect of the Merger_. Upon the consummation of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Presidio shall cease and HBC shall
continue as the surviving entity under the laws of the State of California.
The name of "Heritage Bank of Commerce" as the surviving entity of the Merger
shall remain "Heritage Bank of Commerce." From and after the Effective Time,
HBC, as the surviving entity of the Merger, shall possess all of the
properties and rights and be subject to all of the liabilities and obligations
of Presidio.

 

Section 1.04 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of HBC as in effect immediately before the
effective time of the Merger shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Merger.

 

Section 1.05 _Directors and Executive Officers_. The directors of HBC
immediately before the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, except for the addition of
three new directors as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.27_, each of whom
shall serve until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified.
The executive officers of HBC immediately before the Merger shall be the
executive officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Merger,
except for the addition of Clay Jones, each of whom shall serve until such
time as their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.

 



2

    

Section 1.06 _Possible Alternative Structures_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, HCC
shall be entitled after consultation with Presidio to revise the structure of
effecting the acquisition of Presidio, if (a) there are no adverse federal or
state income tax consequences to Presidios shareholders as a result of the
modification (including no impact upon the opinions of counsel as to tax
matters to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement), (b) the consideration to
be paid to the holders of Presidio Common Stock, Presidio Stock Options and
Restricted Stock Units under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind,
value or reduced in amount and the delivery of such consideration will not be
delayed, (c) the benefits to be received by Presidios directors, officers and
employees under this Agreement are not diminished and (d) such modification
will not delay materially or jeopardize the receipt of any
regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise cause any condition to Closing set
forth in _Article VI_ not to be capable of being fulfilled on a timely basis.
The parties agree to appropriately amend this Agreement and any related
documents in order to reflect any such revised structure.

 

Section 1.07 _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time,
if the Surviving Corporation shall consider that any further assignments or
assurances or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect
or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right,
title and interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of
Presidio acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of the Merger or
(b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Presidio, and its duly
authorized officers and directors immediately before the Effective Time,
shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances and to do all acts
necessary or proper to vest, perfect and confirm title to and possession of
such rights, properties and assets in the Surviving Corporation, and otherwise
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation, are fully authorized in the name of
Presidio, and the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to take any and all such
proper and necessary action.

 

Section 1.08 _United States Federal Income Tax Consequences_. It is
intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" as that term is
used in Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("
_Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization"
as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code (" _Reorganization_
"). Until the Closing, HCC, HBC and Presidio shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a Reorganization, and
will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or
failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a Reorganization.
HCC and Presidio each intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise
required, shall report, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger as a
"reorganization" within the mean of Section 368(a) of the Code.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.01 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of HCC,
HBC or Presidio or the holder of any capital stock of HCC, HBC or Presidio:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Presidio Common Stock_. Each share of
Presidio Common Stock that is owned by HCC or Presidio (as treasury stock or
otherwise) or any of their respective Subsidiaries will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) _HCC Capital Stock_. Each share of HCC Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

(c) _HBC Capital Stock_. Each share of HBC common stock, no par value,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

(d) _Conversion of Presidio Common Stock_. Each share of Presidio Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other
than shares to be cancelled and retired under _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, and
Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right
to receive 2.470 shares of HCC Common Stock (the " _Per Share Exchange Ratio_
"), together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares as specified in
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(g)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(e) _Dilution_. If HCC changes (or the HCC Board sets a related record
date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or
kind of shares of HCC Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction, then the Per Share Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration
will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change to provide to the
holders of Presidio Common Stock (and holders of Presidio Stock Options and
Restricted Stock Units) the same economic effect contemplated by this
Agreement before such change.

(f) _Cancellation of Shares and Closing of Presidio_ __ _s Transfer
Books_. At the Effective Time, (i) none of the shares of Presidio Common Stock
shall be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a valid certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ")
previously representing any shares of Presidio Common Stock or owner
designated by a book entry previously representing a non-certificated share of
Presidio Common Stock (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights in such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Per
Share Exchange Ratio, (ii) any dividends and other distributions under 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(e)_ and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional share of HCC Common Stock under _Section_ __ _ 2.01(g) _or, in the
case of the Presidio Dissenting Shares, the consideration set forth under
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_. The stock transfer books of Presidio shall be closed
for all shares of Presidio Common Stock outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time, and no further transfer of any such shares of Presidio Common
Stock shall be made on such stock

 



4

    

 transfer books after the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, if any
Presidio Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Presidio
Common Stock are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent or to the
Surviving Corporation or HCC, they shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of HCC Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any
such fractional shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Presidio Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of HCC Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of HCC Common Stock issuable to
such holder), in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such
holders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, shall be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of HCC Common
Stock by the HCC Closing Price.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange Agent; Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Before the
Closing Date, HCC shall select, with the prior approval of Presidio (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld), a bank or trust company to act as
exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), and provide the
Exchange Agent with appropriate instructions regarding the matters described
in this _Article II_ in form and substance reasonably acceptable to HCC and
Presidio, all under the provisions of an agreement executed between HCC and
the Exchange Agent in a customary form that is reasonably acceptable to
Presidio. HCC shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
(by instruction to HCCs transfer agent), before the Effective Time (a)
certificates representing the shares of HCC Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ (or make appropriate alternative arrangements if
uncertificated shares of HCC Common Stock represented by a book entry will be
issued) and (b) cash sufficient in lieu of fractional shares to be paid under
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(g)_. The shares of HCC Common Stock and cash amounts
deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred to collectively as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

 

Section 2.03 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) HCC shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent not
later than five business days after the Effective Time to mail to holders of
Presidio Common Stock of record immediately before the Effective Time (i) a
letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in a customary form that
is reasonably acceptable to Presidio and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such holders Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange
Agent for exchange, together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent
or HCC, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing the number of
whole shares of HCC Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of HCC Common Stock
represented by a book entry) to which such holder shall have become entitled
under _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of
cash in lieu of any fractional share of HCC Common Stock, if any, which such
holder has the right to receive as to the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(g)_. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. The Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall be
canceled.

 



5

    

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, HCC or
the Exchange Agent may in its sole discretion require the owner of such lost,
stolen, or destroyed Certificate to make and deliver to HCC or the Exchange
Agent an affidavit of that fact and an agreement in form
reasonably satisfactory to HCC indemnifying HCC and the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against HCC or the Surviving Corporation
and to deliver a bond (in such sum as HCC or the Exchange Agent may reasonably
direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange
Agent, HCC, or the Surviving Corporation as to such Certificate.

 

(d) If any portion of the HCC Common Stock that a person has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance thereof
that the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer.

 

(e) All shares of HCC Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if a
dividend or other distribution is declared by HCC as to the HCC Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions as to the HCC Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Time regarding HCC Common Stock and payable to
the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until the holder thereof
surrenders a Certificate or Book-Entry Share under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.
After the surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable regarding shares of HCC Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to HCC upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ shall
thereafter look only to HCC for satisfaction of their claims for the Per Share
Exchange Ratio, cash in lieu of fractional shares of HCC Common Stock,
and any dividends or distributions as to HCC Common Stock, in each case
without interest thereon. None of HCC, the Surviving Corporation, Presidio or
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Presidio Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
HCC shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Presidio to
establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto.

 



6

    

(g) Each of the Exchange Agent and HCC shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Presidio Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Law. If such amounts are deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(h) Any portion of the HCC Common Stock made available to the Exchange
Agent as to any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to HCC upon demand.

 

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Shares of Presidio Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that are held by a
shareholder who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, the fair
market value of such shares pursuant to and who complies with California law
(a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Dissenting Shares_ " means any shares of Presidio Common Stock that a
Dissenting Shareholder has properly exercised a demand for fair market value
pursuant to California law and has not withdrawn such demand. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist. Any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by California law for the Dissenting Shares owned by such
Dissenting Shareholder and not any Merger Consideration. Presidio and HCC
shall comply with the provisions of California law regarding the Dissenting
Shares. Presidio shall give HCC reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all notices or other communications to be sent to holders of Dissenting
Shares, and Presidio shall consider in good faith any comments of HCC and
revise such notices or communications as may be appropriate. Presidio shall
give HCC (a) prompt notice of any written demands for fair market value,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law relating to shareholders demands for fair market
value and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
regarding the Dissenting Shares; provided that HCC shall act in a commercially
reasonable manner in directing any such negotiations or proceedings. Presidio
shall not, except with the prior written consent of HCC or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, voluntarily make any payment for any demands for
the purchase of Presidio Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

Section 2.05 _Assumption of Stock Options, Restricted Stock Awards and
Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) HCC and Presidio shall take all actions necessary (including delivery
of any required notices by Presidio) to provide that effective as of the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
outstanding stock option (" _Presidio Stock Option_ ") granted by Presidio
to its directors, officers, employees and consultants under the Presidio
Equity Plans, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent the right to
acquire shares of Presidio Common Stock and shall instead be converted
automatically into an option to acquire shares of HCC Common Stock as
provided below (an " _Assumed Option_ "), and such Assumed Options shall be
assumed by HCC on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the corresponding Presidio Stock Option immediately before
the Effective Time, except that after the Effective Time (i) each Assumed
Option shall be exercisable (or shall become

 



7

    

 exercisable by its terms) for a number of shares of HCC Common Stock equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Presidio Common Stock that would
be issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share (ii) the per share exercise price for
the HCC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price
for such Presidio Stock Option outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time by (B) the Per Share Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, (iii) HCC and the compensation committee of the HCC Board shall be
substituted for Presidio and the committee of the Presidio Board (including,
if applicable, the entire Presidio Board) administering the Presidio
Equity Plans, and (iv) each Assumed Option may be exercised solely for shares
of HCC Common Stock. The parties hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the
Assumed Options pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_ is intended
to comply with the requirements of Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) of the
Treasury Regulations for not treating such Assumed Option as the grant of a
new stock right or a change in the form of payment for purposes of Section
409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and, to the extent applicable,
to comply with the requirements of Section 1.424-1(a) of the Treasury
Regulations for not treating such Assumed Option as the modification of a
Presidio Stock Option for purposes of Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in
any event no later than five business days after the Closing Date, HCC shall
deliver to each person who holds an Assumed Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such Presidio Stock Option by HCC. HCC and Presidio
shall cooperate and coordinate regarding any materials to be submitted to the
holders of the Presidio Stock Options in connection with any notice required
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. HCC shall cause the registration of shares
of HCC Common Stock subject to Assumed Options to become effective as part of
a registration statement on Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate
forms, as to the shares of HCC Common Stock subject to such Assumed Options no
later than five business days after the Effective Time; and thereafter, HCC
shall deliver to holders of Assumed Options any applicable prospectus and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements, including the current status of any related
prospectus, for so long as the Assumed Options remain outstanding.

 

(c) HCC and Presidio shall take all actions necessary (including delivery
of any required notices by Presidio) to provide that effective as of the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
outstanding restricted stock unit (" _Restricted Stock Units_ ") granted by
Presidio to its directors, officers, employees and consultants under the
Presidio Equity Plans, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent the
right to acquire shares of Presidio Common Stock and shall instead be
converted automatically into the right to acquire shares of HCC Common Stock.
As to the Restricted Stock Units arising under the 2019 Annual Equity Pool
established under the Presidio Bank 2019 Directors Compensation Plan and the
Presidio Bank 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, if the Closing occurs prior
to January 1, 2020, for each director who continues to serve as a director of
Presidio through the Closing Date, the number of shares of Presidio Common
Stock subject to such directors Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall be determined as of the end of the calendar month
immediately preceding the Closing Date based upon (i) a prorated portion of
the target number of shares of Presidio Common Stock subject to the 2019
Annual Equity Pool (9,041 shares multiplied by the number of months completed
during 2019 prior to the Closing Date and

 



8

    

 divided by 12), (ii) Presidios level of achievement of its aggregate pre-
tax income goal for the months completed during 2019 prior to the
Closing Date and (iii) the directors number of points awarded under the 2019
Annual Equity Pool for service in the months completed during 2019 prior to
the Closing Date relative to the number of such points awarded to all
directors for service in such months. The number of shares of HCC Common
Stock subject to each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to the number of
shares of Presidio Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Closing Date multiplied by the Per Share Exchange
Ratio, which number of shares of HCC Common Stock shall be delivered to the
holders of Restricted Stock Units at Closing, provided that any fractional
shares of HCC Common Stock shall be treated as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.01(g)_.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any vesting conditions
applicable to each award of restricted common stock of Presidio granted under
a Presidio Equity Plan shall, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof and consistent with the terms of the Presidio Equity
Plan, accelerate in full and such restricted stock shall become free of any
restrictions and any repurchase right shall lapse, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive shares of HCC Common Stock in accordance with the
Per Share Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional shares of HCC Common
Stock shall be treated as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(g)_), less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting.

 

(e) At or before the Closing Date, Presidio and the Presidio Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions which may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

(f) The transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ shall in
all cases be completed in a manner designed to comply with Section 409A of
the Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 424 of the Code.

business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Presidio Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) _Charter Documents_. Presidio has delivered or made available to HCC
a correct and complete copy of the Charter Documents of Presidio, as amended
and currently in effect. Presidio is not in violation of any of the provisions
of its Charter Documents.

Presidio may vote.

(c) _Presidio Stock-Based Rights_. Section 3.02(c) of the Presidio
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a complete
and correct list of each Presidio Stock Option, Restricted Stock Unit, and
award of restricted shares of Presidio Common Stock (each, a "

grant of such Presidio Stock Option was by its terms to be effective by all

consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was duly
executed and delivered by each party thereto. Presidio has not granted and
there has not been any Presidio policy or practice to grant any Presidio Stock
Option before, or otherwise coordinated the grant of Presidio Stock Options
with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding Presidio or its financial results or prospects. The treatment of the
Presidio Stock Options provided for under this Agreement is consistent in all
material respects with and not in violation of any document or agreement
pertaining to a Presidio Stock Option, the Presidio Equity Plans or applicable
Law. Since December 31, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, Presidio has
not accelerated the vesting or lapsing of restrictions as to any Presidio
Stock-Based Right or adopted or amended any Presidio Equity Plan. All shares
of Presidio Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to a Presidio Stock-

instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.

 

(d) _Contracts_. Presidio does not have any Contracts (i) to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Presidio or any
equity security of Presidio or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of Presidio or (ii) pursuant to which Presidio is or could be

Material Contract, (ii) give any person the right to declare a default or
accelerate the payment or performance under any Presidio Material Contract,

or both, would constitute such a material breach or default) by Presidio
under any of Presidio Insurance Policies or, to the knowledge of Presidio, by

 Contemplated Transactions or to perform its covenants and agreements under
this Agreement. To the knowledge of Presidio, no event has occurred and no
circumstances exists related to Presidio that is or are reasonably likely to
(a) cause the approvals that are required to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity having approval authority in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions not to be granted, (b) cause such Governmental Entity approvals
would to be subject to a condition which would differ from conditions
customarily imposed by a Governmental Entity in orders approving acquisitions
of the type contemplated by this Agreement or (c) make any of the

Contemplated Transactions unlikely to be fulfilled within the applicable time
period or periods required for satisfaction of such condition or conditions.

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to

capital stock of HBC free and clear of any Liens, and such shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Subsidiaries, has received any written complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries or its internal
accounting controls, including any written complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that HCC or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its directors, officers
or employees, has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices or
fraudulent practices.

 

Section 4.05 _Taxes_. HCC and each of its Subsidiaries have (a) filed all
material Tax Returns that they are required to have filed, and all such Tax
Returns are accurate, correct and complete in all material respects and (b)
paid all material Taxes that they are required to have paid, other than Taxes
currently payable without penalty or interest, or being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings. HCC has not taken or agreed to take any
action or is aware of any fact or circumstance that would prevent or impede,
or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 

Section 4.06 _Material Changes_. Since the date of the latest audited
financial statements included within the SEC Filings, except as disclosed in
subsequent SEC Filings filed before the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred or circumstance arisen that has had or would be reasonably expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a HCC Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.07 _Community Reinvestment Act_. HBC is in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
HBC has not received a CRA rating of less than "satisfactory" in any of its
three most recently completed exams. HCC has no knowledge that HBCs
compliance under the CRA would constitute grounds for either the denial by any
Governmental Entity of any application to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions or the imposition of a Burdensome Condition in connection with
the approval of any such application, or the existence of any fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to result in HBC having its current rating lowered. HBC (i) is not
subject to any agreement, undertaking, order, directive, liability, or any
other commitment or obligation with any Governmental Entity or any other
persons (including any third party group representing community interests)
regarding or otherwise relating to HBCs policies, practices or relations
with customers, vendors or clients or any other CRA Agreement and (ii) has not
been advised since December 31, 2015, by any Governmental Entity or other
persons that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting,
as applicable, any such CRA Agreement. HBC is in compliance with each CRA
Agreement to which it is party or subject, and HBC has not received any
written notice from any Governmental Entity or other persons indicating that
HBC is not in compliance with any such CRA Agreement. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, claim, liability or exception by any Governmental Entity
as to any CRA Agreement. HBC has not received any notice or
other communication (whether (to its knowledge, oral) or written) from any
third-party group representing community interests raising concerns or
objections as to its policies, practices or relations with customers, vendors
or clients, or the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 4.08 _Litigation_. Neither HCC nor any of its Subsidiaries
is party to any Legal Action, nor, to the knowledge of the HCC, is any Legal
Action threatened against HCC or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets (or for which HCC or any of its Subsidiaries
is obligated to indemnify a third party) or, to the knowledge of HCC, against
any executive officer or director of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries in their
capacities in those positions. To the knowledge of HCC, there is no reasonable
basis for and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) would reasonably be expected to give
rise to or serve as a basis for, constitute or result in, any material Legal
Action against HCC or any of its Subsidiaries. No matter described in
_Section_ __ _ 4.08_ of the HCC Disclosure Schedule, individually or in the
aggregate, had or would reasonably be expected to have a HCC Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.09 _No Brokers_ _; Fairness Opinion_. Other than HCCs
engagement of D.A. Davidson, whose fees and costs will be borne by HCC, no
action has been taken by HCC that would give rise to any valid claim against
any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finders fee or other like
payment as to the Contemplated Transactions. The HCC Board has received the
verbal opinion of D.A. Davidson, to be confirmed in writing as of the date of
this Agreement to the effect that, as of such date, and based on the
assumptions, qualifications, and limitations contained therein, the Per Share
Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of Presidio Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger is fair to the HCC shareholders from a financial point of view.

Section 4.10 _HCC Information_. The information provided by HCC relating
to HCC and its Subsidiaries that is to be contained in the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, any filings or approvals
under applicable state securities Laws, any filing pursuant to the Securities
Act or under the Exchange Act, or in any other document filed with any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the matters set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 4.10_, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other Laws, as
applicable.

 

Section 4.11 _Regulatory Reports and Filings_. The HCC Reports and other
filings and the reports and filings of its Subsidiaries required to be filed
with any Governmental Entity through the Closing Date will comply in all
material respects with the applicable Law of such Governmental Entity with
which it will be filed and none of the reports or other filings will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they will be made, not misleading. Any
financial statement contained in any such report, or other filing that is
intended to present the financial position of HCC and its Subsidiaries (or as
on a consolidated basis) will fairly present in all material respects
the financial position of HCC and its Subsidiaries (or as on a consolidated
basis) and will be prepared according to GAAP. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.11,_ HCC makes no representation
or warranty as to any information supplied by Presidio for inclusion in any
such reports.

 

Section 4.12 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) _Compliance_. Since December 31, 2015, HCC and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects and are not in material
violation of (i) any applicable Law, including all Laws as to data protection
or privacy, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, the CRA, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Truth in
Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Flood

Federal Reserve Act, and all legal requirements relating to the origination,
sale and servicing of loans and (ii) any posted or internal privacy policies
relating to data protection or privacy, including without limitation, the
protection of personal information. Neither HCC nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Entity asserting that it is not in compliance with any Law which
such Governmental Entity enforces (excluding comments resulting from routine
regulatory examinations that have subsequently been resolved to the
satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Entity), and to the knowledge of
HCC, no grounds for the foregoing exist. No matter described in Section
4.12(a) of the HCC Disclosure Schedule, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an HCC Material Adverse
Effect.

 



50

    

(b) _Unfair and Deceptive Actions_. Neither HCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices
in violation of applicable Law, and there are no allegations, claims or
disputes to which HCC or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that allege, or to
the knowledge of HCC, no person has threatened or threatens to allege, that
HCC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair, deceptive or abusive
acts or practices in violation of applicable Law.

 

(c) _Bank Secrecy Act; Anti-Money Laundering_. Since December 31, 2015, to
the knowledge of HCC, there do not exist any facts or circumstances that
would cause HCC or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed to be operating in
violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT
Act, any Order issued as to anti-money laundering by OFAC, or any other
applicable anti-money laundering Law or the provisions of the Bank Secrecy
Act/anti-money laundering program adopted by HCC or any of its Subsidiaries.
The HBC Board has adopted and implemented a Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering program that also satisfies the applicable requirements of the USA
PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and none of HCC or any of its
Subsidiaries has not received any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Entity that such program has been deemed
ineffective in meeting the requirements of the such Laws. HCC and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with any requirements to
file reports and other necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act
and the regulations thereunder.

(d) _Privacy of Customer Information_. To the knowledge of HCC, there do
not exist any facts or circumstances that would cause HCC or any of its
Subsidiaries to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material
respect with the applicable privacy of customer information requirements
contained in any federal and state privacy Laws, including in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder and
the provisions of the information security program adopted by HBC. To the
knowledge of HCC, since December 31, 2015, no non-public customer information
has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner
that would cause HCC or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial
action. No claims are pending and, to the knowledge of HCC, no claims have
been asserted or threatened against HCC or any of its Subsidiaries or are
likely to be asserted or threatened against HCC or any of its Subsidiaries by
any person alleging a violation of such persons privacy, personal or
confidentiality rights under any such Laws, policies or procedures. As to all
personal information described in this _Section_ __ _ 4.12(d)_ HCC and each
of its Subsidiaries has taken all steps reasonably necessary (including

material respects with the Laws, policies or procedures referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.12(d)_.

ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance policies,
its internal controls, its management or its operations or business. None of
HCC or any of its Subsidiaries has received at any time since December 31,
2015, any written notice or other written communication whether from any
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such Order. Except for normal examinations conducted by a
Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the business of HCC or any of
its Subsidiaries, no Governmental Entity has initiated since December 31,
2015, or has pending any Legal Action before, or, to the knowledge of HCC,
any inquiry, examination or investigation by, any Governmental Entity into the
business or operations, policies, practices or disclosures of HCC or any of
its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of HCC, threatened any of
the foregoing. There is no material unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Governmental Entity as to any report or statement relating to
any examination of HCC or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither HCC or HBC has been
informed that its status as "well-capitalized," or "well managed" will change
within the next 12 months. No matter described in Section 4.13 of the HCC
Disclosure Schedule has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an HCC Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.14 _Governmental Approvals and Other Conditions_. Neither HCC
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or intend to take any action, nor does
HCC have knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would materially impede or
delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or the ability of
the parties to obtain any approval of any Governmental Entity required for the
Contemplated Transactions or to perform its covenants and agreements under
this Agreement. To the knowledge of HCC, no event has occurred and no
circumstances exists that are reasonably likely to (a) cause the approvals
that are required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity having approval
authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions not be granted, (b)
cause such Governmental Entity approvals to be subject to a condition which
would differ from conditions customarily imposed by a Governmental Entity in
orders approving acquisitions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or
(c) make any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of HCC and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the Contemplated Transactions unlikely to be
fulfilled within the applicable time period or periods required for
satisfaction of such condition or conditions. Without limitation of the
foregoing, HBC and HCC will be "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes
following consummation of the Contemplated Transaction, and to the knowledge
of HCC, consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not require HCC or
HBC to raise capital or otherwise secure any financing commitments from any
third-parties or require any financing contingencies.

 

Section 4.15 _Labor_. HCC and its Subsidiaries have complied and are in
compliance in all material respects with applicable Law with respect to
employment, termination of employment, and terms, practices, conditions and
classification of employment (including applicable Law regarding family and
medical leave, disability, labor relations, workers compensation, wage and
hour requirements, immigration, discrimination, employee health and

practices that would reasonably be expected to have a HCC Material Adverse
Effect.

representations and warranties in this Article IV, neither HCC nor any other
person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
HCC, HBC, their respective Subsidiaries or their respective business,

Section 5.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto shall authorize and
permit the other party and its Representatives, to have access during normal

firm relating to its work papers and its audits of the books and records as
may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with its review

disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any applicable Law,
agreement or fiduciary duty or violate the rights, interests or confidence of
any customer (it being agreed that the parties shall

 



60

    

 use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy or contravention).
No investigation shall affect any partys representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available to a party pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) HCC and Presidio shall, and cause their respective Representatives to,

person as to any Acquisition Proposal or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse, or recommend, or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any letter
of intent, letter of interest, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum
of understanding, merger agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement (whether binding or
not) constituting or as to or intended to, or that may reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in or permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b)_) or (v) that is
intended or that may reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment,
termination or failure to consummate the Merger. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Presidio acknowledges and agrees that any
violation of or the taking of any action inconsistent with any of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
Presidio, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of Presidio, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.04_ by Presidio.

 

(b) Before the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Presidio Vote, 
_Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)_ shall not prohibit Presidio from furnishing nonpublic
information regarding Presidio to or entering into negotiations or discussions
with any person in response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that a majority of the entire authorized Presidio Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel) constitutes or is more likely than not to result in a
Superior Proposal that is submitted to Presidio by such person (and not
withdrawn before the furnishing of such information or such discussions) if
(i) neither Presidio nor any Representative of Presidio shall have violated
any of the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)_, (ii) the
Presidio Board concludes in good faith, after having obtained and taken into
account the advice of its outside legal counsel, that such action is required
or reasonably likely to be required in order for the Presidio Board to comply
with its fiduciary obligations to Presidios shareholders under applicable
Law, (iii) at least two (2) business days before furnishing any such nonpublic
information to or entering into discussions with such

 



61

    

 person Presidio gives HCC written notice of the identity of such person and
of Presidios intention to furnish nonpublic information to or enter into
discussions with such person, and Presidio receives from such person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) at least two business
days before furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person Presidio
furnishes such nonpublic information to HCC (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished by Presidio to HCC).

 

(c) Presidio shall notify HCC promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of (i) any inquiry or indication of interest that may
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) an Acquisition Proposal (including or
any modification of or an amendment to any Acquisition Proposal) or (iii) any
request for nonpublic information relating to Presidio (including access to
the properties, books or records of Presidio) by any person that has made, or
to the knowledge of Presidio, may be considering making, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to HCC shall be made orally and in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the person submitting any of the foregoing, and the
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (or modification or amendment),
inquiry, indication or request. Presidio shall keep HCC fully informed on a
current basis of any additional information requested or provided by Presidio
and any changes in the status and any changes or modifications in the terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication or request.

 

(d) Presidio shall instruct its Representatives to immediately cease and
terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
persons (other than HCC) initiated before the date of this Agreement as to the
possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. Presidio shall
request all persons (other than HCC and its Representatives and Presidios
Representatives) who have been furnished confidential information regarding
Presidio in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months before the date of this Agreement
to promptly return or destroy such information (and provide certification
thereof). Presidio acknowledges that it has cancelled access to any third
party seeking to combine with Presidio in an Acquisition Proposal which has
been granted access to any virtual or other data room maintained by or on
behalf of Presidio other than HCC and its Representatives.

 

(e) Subject to applicable Law and _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b)_ herein, Presidio
shall not release any person from and agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce the confidentiality, standstill non-solicitation or similar
provisions of any agreement to which Presidio is a party as to an Acquisition
Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have
been given before the date of this Agreement under any such
provisions authorizing any person to make an Acquisition Proposal.

Section 5.05 _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
NASDAQ Listing_.

(a) HCC will prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other
applicable form (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be promptly filed by HCC
with the SEC in connection with the issuance of the HCC Common Stock in the
Merger, including the shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.05(c) herein,
(including the notice, proxy statement and prospectus and other joint

 



62

    

 proxy solicitation materials of Presidio and HCC constituting a part thereof
(the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and all related documents). HCC
and Presidio shall cooperate with the other party, its counsel and its
accountants, in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and to use their reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC within 50 days
following the date of this Agreement. HCC and Presidio shall each use their
respective reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Registration Statement
and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to respond timely to any comments of the SEC or its
staff, and to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC. HCC
shall notify Presidio timely of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or for additional information and
shall supply Presidio with copies of all correspondence between HCC or any of
its Representatives, and the SEC or its staff, as to the Registration
Statement. HCC shall also file and use reasonable commercial efforts to cause
to become effective as commercially reasonable any amendment to the
Registration Statement, including the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, if
required, and Presidio and HCC shall mail to its shareholders any such
amendment that becomes necessary after the date the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC. If at any time before the Effective Time
either Presidio or HCC becomes aware of any event or circumstance that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, it shall promptly inform the
other party. HCC will advise Presidio timely after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, or any request by the staff of the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon
or responses thereto.

 

(b) HCC shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause all documents that
it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
applicable.

 

(c) Before the Effective Time, HCC shall use reasonable commercial efforts
to qualify the HCC Common Stock under the securities or the "blue sky" laws
of such jurisdictions as may be required, except that HCC shall not be
required to (i) qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified, (ii) file a general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation
in any jurisdiction in which it is not so subject.

 

(d) HCC shall use reasonable commercial efforts to have the shares of HCC
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger listed on the NASDAQ Global Market as
of the Closing Date upon notice of issuance.

 

Section 5.06 _Shareholder Meeting_ _s_.

 

(a) Presidio shall take all action necessary and appropriate according to
applicable Law and its Charter Documents to call, give notice of, convene
and, as soon as promptly practicable but not later than 45 days after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under

 



63

    

 the Securities Act by the SEC, hold a meeting of its shareholders ("
_Presidio Meeting_ "), and use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
proxies to obtain the relevant shareholder approvals to obtain the Requisite
Presidio Vote. Presidio and HCC shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to schedule and convene the Presidio Meeting and the HCC Meeting on
the same day. Presidio (in consultation with HCC) shall set a single date for
persons entitled to notice of and to vote at the Presidio Meeting and shall
not change such record date (whether in connection with the Presidio Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof) without the prior consent of HCC.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.06(d) and (e)_, the Presidio Board shall
at all times before and during the Presidio Meeting recommend that the
Presidio shareholders approve of this Agreement and the Merger (" _Presidio
Board Recommendation_ "). Presidio shall cause its proxy materials to (i) set
forth its directors commitment to vote the Presidio Common Stock for which
he or she has voting authority for the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger and (ii) to include the Presidio Board Recommendation.

 

(c) Presidio shall cooperate and keep HCC informed on a current basis
regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the shareholders of
Presidio. HCC may require Presidio to adjourn, delay or postpone the Presidio
Meeting once for a period not to exceed 30 days (but before the date that is
two business days before the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary
to obtain the Requisite Presidio Vote. Presidio shall not, without the prior
written consent of HCC, adjourn or postpone the Presidio Meeting, except that
Presidio may, without the prior written consent of HCC, adjourn or postpone
the Presidio Meeting if after consultation with HCC, if the failure to adjourn
or postpone the Presidio Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement
or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. During any such period
of adjournment, delay or postponement, Presidio shall continue in all respects
to comply with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, and shall in
good faith use commercially reasonable efforts (including engaging a proxy
solicitor) to obtain the Requisite Presidio Vote.

 

(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.06(e)_, neither the Presidio Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the Presidio
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to HCC (it being understood that the
failure of the Presidio Board Recommendation to be unanimous shall constitute
a withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification that is adverse to
HCC), (ii) adopt or propose a resolution to withdraw, amend or qualify the
Presidio Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to HCC, (iii) take any other
action that is or becomes disclosed publicly and which can reasonably be
interpreted to indicate that the Presidio Board or any committee thereof does
not support the Merger and this Agreement or does not believe that the Merger
and this Agreement are in the best interests of Presidios shareholders (it
being understood that taking a neutral position or no position as to any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute an adverse modification), (iv) publicly
announce its intention to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the Presidio
Recommendation in a manner adverse to HCC, (v) fail to reaffirm without
qualification the Presidio Board Recommendation, or fail to state publicly
without qualification that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best
interests of Presidios shareholders, within five business days after HCC
requests in writing that such action be taken, (vi) fail to announce publicly,
within 10 business days after a tender offer or exchange offer 

 



64

    

 relating to securities of HCC shall have been commenced, that the HCC Board
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, (vii) fail to issue,
within ten business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced,
a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal, (viii)
approve, endorse, or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (ix) resolve or
propose to take any action described in  _clauses (i)_ __ _ through (viii)_
of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses _(i)_ __
_ through (viii)_ of this sentence is referred to as a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "). 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 5.06(d)_,
at any time before, but not after obtaining the Requisite Presidio Vote, the
Presidio Board may effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(h)_, if (i) Presidio has complied
with its obligations under _Sections 5.04_ , (ii) Presidio receives an
unsolicited bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from any person that is
not withdrawn and (iii) (A) a majority of the entire authorized Presidio Board
determines in good faith, (after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Presidio Board to take such action on the
Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to be, required in order for
the Presidio Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Presidio
shareholders under applicable Law and (B) (1) Presidio provides HCC prior
written notice at least five business days (or such longer period as it may be
extended upon the modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as
contemplated below) (" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") before taking such
action, which notice shall state that the Presidio Board has received a
Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Presidio Board has resolved to effect a Change of
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01(h)_, as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for such Change
of Recommendation or termination, including the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal (including copies of the proposed documents and
agreements to effect the Superior Proposal) and the identity of the person
making the Superior Proposal (it being understood that the Notice of Superior
Proposal shall not in and of itself be deemed a Change of Recommendation or
termination), (2) during such five business day period (as it may be extended
upon the modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as contemplated
below), Presidio negotiates in good faith (including by making its officers,
directors and its financial and legal advisors available to negotiate) with
HCC (to the extent that HCC wishes to negotiate) to enable HCC to make an
improved offer that is favorable to the shareholders of Presidio so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and
(3) at the end of such five business day period (as it may be extended upon
the modification or amendment of the Acquisition Proposal as contemplated
below, or such earlier time that HCC advises Presidio in writing that it no
longer wishes to negotiate to amend this Agreement), a majority of the entire
authorized Presidio Board, after taking into account any modifications to the
terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by HCC after receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, continues to believe (after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to accept the Acquisition
Proposal is required, or is reasonably likely to be required, in order for the
Presidio Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Presidio shareholders under applicable Law. In the event of any revisions to
the terms of an Acquisition Proposal that are material to such Acquisition
Proposal and made after the start of the five business day period of _clause
(iii)(B)(1)_ , 

 



65

    

 such revisions shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and Presidio shall
be required to deliver a new written notice as required by clause (iii)(B)(1)
to HCC and to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06(e)_
as to such new Acquisition Proposal.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 7.01(h), nothing in _Section_ __ _
5.06(e)_ shall be interpreted to excuse Presidio and the Presidio Board from
complying with its unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders at the Presidio Meeting and Presidio and the Presidio Board shall
not submit to the vote of its shareholders at or before the Presidio Meeting
any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. Without limiting the
foregoing, if the Presidio Board has withdrawn or modified the Presidio Board
Recommendation as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(e)_, then, unless this
Agreement has been terminated under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(h)_, the Presidio
Board shall submit this Agreement to Presidios shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the
date of this Agreement may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the
Presidio Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to
Presidios shareholders in Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(g) HCC shall take all actions necessary according to applicable Law and
its Charter Documents to call, give notice of, convene and, as soon as
practicable but not later than 45 days after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC, hold a meeting of its
shareholders (" _HCC Meeting_ "), and use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the relevant shareholder approvals to obtain the
Requisite HCC Vote. The HCC Board shall at all times before and during the HCC
Meeting recommend that the HCC shareholders approve the Agreement and the
Merger and the issuance of HCC Common Stock contemplated hereby (" _HCC Board
Recommendation_ "). HCC shall cause its proxy materials to (i) set forth its
directors commitment to vote the HCC Common Stock for which he or she has
voting authority for the approval of the Agreement and the Merger and (ii) to
include the HCC Board Recommendation. HCC shall cooperate and keep Presidio
informed on a current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting
results following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
the shareholders of HCC. Presidio may require HCC to adjourn, delay or
postpone the HCC Meeting once for a period not to exceed 45 days (but before
the date that is two business days before the End Date) to solicit additional
proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite HCC Vote. HCC shall not, without the
prior written consent of Presidio, adjourn or postpone the HCC Meeting, except
that HCC may, without the prior written consent of Presidio, adjourn or
postpone the HCC Meeting if after consultation with Presidio, if the failure
to adjourn or postpone the HCC Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement
or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. During any such period
of adjournment, delay or postponement, HCC shall continue in all respects to
comply with its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, and shall in
good faith use commercially reasonable efforts (including engaging a proxy
solicitor) to obtain the Requisite HCC Vote.

 

Section 5.07 _Approvals and Consents_.

 

(a) The parties will cooperate and use reasonable commercial efforts to
prepare as promptly as practicable all documentation, to make all filings,
notices, applications and to obtain all consents, approvals, permits and other
authorizations of any Governmental Entity necessary

 



66

    

 or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and to make and
obtain all other required third party consents as set forth on Section
3.03(b) of the Presidio Disclosure Schedule (the " _Required Third Party
Consents_ "), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
approvals and consents. Any initial filings with Regulatory Agencies in
connection with the Merger shall be made by HCC and HBC within 45 days after
the date of this Agreement. HCC and Presidio shall upon request furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of HCC, HBC or Presidio or any
Governmental Entity or third party in connection with the Merger and the
other Contemplated Transactions. The parties shall have the right to review in
advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable Law, all the non-confidential information
relating to HCC, HBC or Presidio (excluding any confidential financial
information relating to individuals), as applicable, that appear in any filing
made with or written materials submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other as to
the obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Required Third Party
Consents.

 

(b) The parties shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Required Third
Party Consents and the completion of the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing the parties
shall (i) timely furnish the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by it (or written summaries of communications received
orally) from any third party or Governmental Entity as to the Contemplated
Transactions and (ii) provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable accept the reasonable comments of the
other in connection with any proposed non-confidential written communication
with any Governmental Entity or third party and consider in good faith the
other partys views as to and confer in good faith with each other to resolve
any disagreement as to strategy as to any such communication.

 

(c) If Presidio or HCC receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity as to Contemplated

to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(d) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, under
no circumstances shall the parties be required, and none of them shall be

to take any action or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition,
restriction or requirement, involving any of them pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.07_ or otherwise in connection with obtaining the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, that would, or would be reasonably likely to, individually or in
the aggregate, materially reduce the benefits of the Merger to such a degree
that HCC or Presidio would not have entered into this Agreement had such
conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the date of this
Agreement (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "), except that if requested by HCC,
then Presidio will take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any
such condition or restriction, so long as such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Presidio only in the event the Closing
occurs.

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ ,

Governmental Entity challenging the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions, the parties shall cooperate in all respects and shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Action and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions.

Section 5.10 _Supplemental Disclosure Schedules and Notification_. During
the Pre-Closing Period:

 

(a) Presidio and HCC will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure
schedule delivered with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any
matter, which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement
would have been required to be set forth or described in such disclosure
schedule as of the date of this Agreement, or which is necessary to correct
any information in any representation or warranty or such disclosure schedule
which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. Delivery of such supplemental
disclosure schedules shall not cure a breach or modify a representation
or warranty of this Agreement or for determining the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_
(in the case of HCC) or _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_
(in the case of Presidio) or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

(b) Each party shall give prompt notice to the other parties of any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it,
to result in a Presidio Material Adverse Effect or HCC Material Adverse
Effect, as applicable, for such party, (ii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or (iii) is reasonably likely to lead to
litigation or regulatory action that would delay or prevent the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 5.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.26_, HCC and HBC shall have the right but
not the obligation to offer employment immediately following the Effective
Time to any and all persons who are employees of Presidio immediately before
the Effective Time (employees who will be employed by HCC or HBC are referred
to as " _Continuing Employees_ "). Presidio will provide HCC with information
regarding such persons current employment arrangements with Presidio and will
otherwise assist HCC and HBC in making such offers. Continuing Employees
shall be offered salary or wage levels at least equal to the salary or wage
levels to which such employees were entitled to immediately before the Closing
Date. Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, as soon
as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, HCC shall take all
reasonable action so that Continuing Employees shall be entitled to
participate in each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of HCC and
HBC of general applicability (the " _HCC Benefit Plans_ ") to the same extent
as similarly-situated employees of HCC and HBC (it being understood that
inclusion of Continuing Employees in HCC Benefit Plans may occur at different
times as to different plans), except that coverage shall be continued under
corresponding benefit plans of Presidio (to the extent such plans have not
been terminated) until such employees are permitted to participate in the HCC
Benefit Plans. Accordingly, HCC shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
ensure that from the Closing Date through the next open enrollment date for a
HCC or HBC group health, dental, and vision, Continuing Employees shall
continue to be covered by Presidios group health, dental, and vision. All
Presidio incentive or bonus plans shall remain in effect for the entirety of
2019 until all payouts under such plan have been made to all Presidio
employees no later than the last day of the first quarter of 2020 (whether by
Presidio or HCC, as the case may be). Any Presidio employee terminated as a
result of the transactions contemplated

 



70

    

 by the Agreement prior to December 31, 2019 will be eligible for a pro-rata
bonus under such incentive or bonus plans for time served during
2019. Payouts to such employees will be limited to the amount accrued by
Presidio in its financial statements for such purpose. If the Closing occurs
prior to December 31, 2019, such accrual will continue from Closing until
December 31, 2019 at the monthly rate in place in the last full month prior
to the month in which the Closing occurs. All accruals will be made in
accordance with the terms of the plans and consistent with past practice.

 

(b) To the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by HCC or HBC, either of
them, as applicable, shall cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the
service of such Continuing Employee with Presidio for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan,
to the same extent that such service was recognized immediately before the
Effective Time under a corresponding Presidio Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately before
the Effective Time, except that such recognition of service shall not (i)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee as to the same
period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement under which similarly situated employees of HCC and HBC do not
receive credit for prior service.

(c) If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in any HCC
Benefit Plan that provides medical, hospitalization or dental benefits, HCC or
HBC, as applicable, shall use commercial efforts to request from the
appropriate sponsor or provider that (i) any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such HCC Benefit Plan be
waived as to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied or not applicable
under a Presidio Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) recognize any health expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents in the
year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such HCC Benefit Plan.

 

(d) HCC in its sole discretion, may elect to terminate the Presidio 401(k)
Plan or to discontinue contributions to the Presidio 401(k) Plan anytime
following the Effective Time, to cause Presidio to terminate the 401(k) Plan
to be effective at the Effective Time, or to merge the Presidio 401(k) Plan
with and into the HBC 401(k) Plan after the Effective Time. In no event shall
the Presidio 401(k) Plan be merged with and into the HBC 401(k) Plan, unless
HCC determines in its reasonable judgment that (i) the Presidio 401(k) Plan is
a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, both as to the form of the
Presidio 401(k) Plan and as to its operation and (ii) there are no facts in
existence that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified
status of the Presidio 401(k) Plan. If HCC determines in its sole discretion
not to merge the Presidio 401(k) Plan into the HBC 401(k) Plan and notifies
Presidio in writing not less than 20 days prior to the Closing Date that the
Presidio 401(k) Plan should be terminated before the Effective Time, Presidio
agrees to take all action necessary to have the Presidio 401(k) Plan
terminated before the Effective Time in accordance with its terms (including
adopting written resolutions to terminate the Presidio 401(k) Plan in form
reasonably acceptable to HCC). In the event that HCC so notifies Presidio
that the Presidio 401(k) Plan be terminated, Presidio shall provide HCC with
written evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance 

 



71

    

 of which shall be subject to review and approval by HCC) not later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time; except that the effectiveness of
such termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. In the
event that HCC requests that the Presidio 401(k) Plan be terminated,
Continuing Employees shall be permitted to roll over their Presidio 401(k)
Plan account distributions (including direct rollover of any distributed plan
loans) received on termination of the Presidio 401(k) Plan to the 401(k) Plan
maintained by HCC or the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Closing, Presidio
shall have paid into the Presidio 401(k) Plan all discretionary employer
contributions, including any employer matching contributions, profit sharing
contributions or other non-elective contributions.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, HBC (or Presidio through its payroll process
directed by HCC immediately prior to the Effective Time) will provide a
severance benefit to each employee of Presidio who was employed immediately
before the Effective Time (except for any employee who is a party to any
written agreement relating to severance which agreement has been provided to
HCC or who enters into an employment agreement with HCC or HBC effective on or
after the Closing Date) and whose employment is terminated involuntarily
(either at or within 12 months after the Closing Date), other than
for "Cause" (as defined below), in a lump sum payment equal to four weeks of
such employees regularly scheduled base salary or base wages at the time of
termination of employment plus an additional two weeks salary for every year
of completed service before the Closing Date (prorated for partial year). For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(e)_, " _Cause_ " shall mean the
employees gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of employees
duties, breach of fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty, commission of an act of
fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or theft in the course of employees
employment, or the violation of any Law (other than traffic violations
or similar minor offenses that do not harm the reputation of HCC or
Presidio).

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.09_, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11 _are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Presidio Employee
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by HCC, HBC, or Presidio, (ii) alter or limit the ability of HCC or
HBC to amend, modify or terminate any Presidio Employee Plan or HCC Benefit
Plan), employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with HCC or HBC, or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

 

(g) Presidio shall not send any written notices or other written
communication materials to its employees without the prior written consent of
HCC as to matters described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

 



72

    

Section 5.12 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, HCC and HBC shall jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been
at any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the
Effective Time, an officer or director of Presidio (each an " _Indemnified
Party_ " and collectively, " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall
require the prior written consent of HCC), whether joint or several, in
connection with any Legal Action (each, a " _Claim_ "), in which an
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness,
arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such person is or was an
officer or director of Presidio if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including, but
not limited to, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Party would be
entitled under applicable Law, the Presidio Charter Documents and any
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth on _Section_
__ _ 3.22_ of the Presidio Disclosure Schedule, (" _Presidio Indemnification
Agreements_ "), in all cases subject to applicable Law. HCC and HBC shall pay
reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in advance of the
final disposition of any such Legal Action to each Indemnified Party to the
maximum extent permissible under applicable Law and the Presidio
Indemnification Agreements upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated or determined not to be
entitled to indemnification under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 5.12(a)_, upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify HCC thereof,
except that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of HCC under
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that HCC is prejudiced as a
consequence. In the event of any such Legal Action (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time) (i) HCC shall have the right, upon prompt written
notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof and HCC shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if HCC elects not
to assume such defense or an Indemnified Party or the parties to such action
include both the Indemnified Party and HCC or HBC and there may be defenses
available to such Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to
those available to HCC and HBC (in which case neither HCC or HBC shall have
the right to assume the defense of such action on the Indemnified Partys
behalf), such Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it, and HCC
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such
Indemnified Party timely as statements therefor are received, except that HCC
shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii)
each Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim and
(iii) HCC shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, except that HCC shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated under 
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) On or before the Closing Date, Presidio shall purchase, at its own
expense, for the benefit of Presidio and HCC and the Surviving Corporation
(including their respective successors) and persons who were officers or
directors of Presidio before the Closing Date, a prepaid tail policy or
policies from Presidios current directors and officers liability insurer
(or from another insurance carrier of substantially similar size and
reputation to that of such former 

 



73

    

 insurer) providing coverages no less favorable to the insured persons than
the level and scope of directors and officers liability as set forth in
Presidios current directors and officers liability insurance policies in
effect as of the Closing (together, such tail policy or policies are referred
to as the (the " _Tail Insurance Policy_ "). The term of the Tail Insurance
Policy shall be for a period of six years or, if such term of coverage is not
available, such other maximum period of coverage available at a cost not
exceeding (without the prior consent of HCC) 250% of the current amount
expended on an annual basis by Presidio for its current policy (the "
_Maximum Tail Expense_ "). In the event such insurer declines to provide the
Tail Policy before the Closing Date or Presidio is otherwise unable to obtain
such coverage from its current insurer or another comparable insurer after
commercially reasonable efforts, HCC or HBC shall obtain, on or before the
Closing Date, as much comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the
aggregate for such six year period up to the Maximum Tail Expense. Before the
Effective Time, Presidio shall notify the appropriate directors and officers
liability insurers of the Merger and of all pending or, to the knowledge of
Presidio, threatened Legal Actions asserted or claimed against any officer
or director of Presidio, or circumstances to the knowledge of Presidio
reasonably likely to give rise thereto to the extent known by Presidio,
according to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies. Presidios
directors and officers shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate
with Presidio (if before the Closing Date) or HCC in obtaining the above-
described insurance coverages. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(c)_ is
intended to or shall limit or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements of Presidio set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Presidio Indemnification Agreements (if
applicable for a director or officer) shall supersede the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_.

(e) This  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall survive the Effective Time and is
intended to benefit each Indemnified Person (each of whom shall be entitled to
enforce this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ against HCC and HBC) and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of HCC and HBC.

Section 5.13 _Human Resources Issues_.

(a) Presidio will consult in good faith with HCC regarding the nature and
content of any formal presentation of the Merger to employees of Presidio
under an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory to both of the parties.
Presidio agrees to work in good faith with HCC to facilitate the timely and
accurate dissemination of information to employees regarding matters as to
the Merger in such a manner as to cause minimal disruption of the business of
Presidio and of its relationships with their employees and to facilitate the
transition of such relationships to HCC and HBC. In addition, Presidio and
HCC shall jointly cooperate in providing communications to Presidios officers
and employees regarding the Merger to maintain a mutually agreeable and
consistent message.

 

(b) HCC and HBC shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 30
business days before the Closing Date, to provide training to employees of
Presidio who will become employees of HCC or HBC. Such training shall be at
the expense of HCC and HBC and shall be conducted during normal business
hours. At the request of Presidio, HCC shall compensate employees, under
Presidios customary policies and practices, for the employees time being
trained by HCC and HBC. Presidio shall cooperate with HCC to make such
employees available for such training before Closing.

 



74

    

Section 5.14 _Transition_.

 

(a) Commencing on the date of this Agreement, and subject to applicable
Law, Presidio and HCC shall cooperate to facilitate the integration and
conversion and development of other mutually agreed operational issues to be
implemented after the Effective Time. Presidio will continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts for conversion to a CECL model for its
accounting system. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the
date of this Agreement through the Closing Date and consistent with the
performance of their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation Presidio
in the ordinary course of business and applicable Law, Presidio shall cause
the employees and officers of Presidio, to cooperate with HCC and HBC in
performing tasks reasonably required in connection with operational
integration.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_, Presidio
shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to provide data processing, item
processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist HCC
and HBC performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful
conversion of the data and other files and records of Presidio to the
production environment of HCC and HBC, when reasonably requested by HCC and in
such a manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at
the time (after the Effective Time) designated by HCC. Among other things,
Presidio shall (i) cooperate with HCC and HBC to establish a mutually
agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion, (ii) use its reasonable
commercial efforts to have Presidios outside contractors continue to support
both the conversion effort and its on-going needs until the conversion can be
established, (iii) provide or use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts requested
by HCC or HBC for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably
practicable, (iv) provide reasonable access to the personnel and facilities of
Presidio and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside
contractors personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be
completed on schedule and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, of
the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other
third-party vendors when reasonably directed by HCC and at such times and in
such form as shall be reasonably acceptable to Presidio. The parties agree
that all of actions taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall be
taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business
activities of Presidio, without taking action that would give HCC control
over the management or policies of Presidio.

(c) Presidio shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
HBC to achieve a successful integration with the HBC CECL model.

 

Section 5.15 _Pre-Closing Policies and Actions_. Upon written notice from
HCC that all conditions to the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that
the Merger will promptly close following receipt of such written notice:

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Presidio shall as HCC directs
and consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules
and regulations of any applicable Regulatory Agency and applicable Law, modify
or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
HCC.

 



75

    

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Presidio shall make such
accounting entries or adjustments as HCC shall direct as a result of its on-
going review of Presidio that are consistent with GAAP in order to implement
its plans following the Closing or to reflect expenses and costs of the
Merger.

(c) Unless the recording adjustments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_
or _(b)_ would otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or
with regulatory accounting principles or GAAP, no such adjustment or
modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be
considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure
to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement by
Presidio that any such adjustment or modification or change is appropriate or
required or that any financial statement or information previously provided by
Presidio was incorrect in any respect.

Section 5.16 _Expense Report; Transaction Expenses_. Presidio shall cause
its attorneys, accountants, auditors and investment bankers which rendered
services to Presidio in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
(collectively, the " _Advisors_ ") to submit to Presidio estimates of their
fees and expenses for all services rendered in any respect in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions and their reasonable estimates of the amounts of
the fees and expenses they expect to incur up to and including the Closing
Date at least five business days before the Closing Date. Presidio shall
update _Section_ __ _ 3.32_ of the Presidio Disclosure Schedule and prepare
and submit to HCC no later than five business days before the Closing Date a
final calculation of all Transaction Expenses, certified by Presidios Chief
Financial Officer with support for all items therein in a form and substance
reasonable to HCC. Based on such summary, Presidio shall prepare and submit a
final calculation of such fees and expenses, and Presidio shall accrue and
pay the amount of such fees and expenses as calculated above. Presidio shall
cause the Advisors to submit their final bills for such fees and expenses to
Presidio for services rendered before the Closing Date and such Advisors
shall release Presidio, HCC and the Surviving Corporation from liability, or
shall have advised them in writing that, upon payment in full of such amounts,
they shall have no liability for any fees or expenses to such
Advisors arising prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.17 _Closing Financial Statements_. At least five business days
prior to the Closing Date, Presidio shall deliver the unaudited balance sheet
of Presidio in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to HCC, as of the
close of business on the last business day of the calendar month
ended immediately preceding the Closing Date or, if the Closing Date occurs
during the first five business days of the month, as of the close of business
on the last business day of the second month immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet Date_ ") and Presidios unaudited
consolidated statement of income for the period January 1, 2019 through the

assets, liabilities and tangible common equity of 

 



76

    

 Presidio as of the date of the Closing Financial Statements, (b) be prepared
in a manner consistent with the balance sheets included in Presidio Financial
Statements, in accordance with either GAAP or regulatory accepted accounting
procedures, as applicable, consistently applied, and (c) be prepared from, and
be in accordance with, the books and records of Presidio. The Closing
Financial Statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of Presidios
Chief Financial Officer, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that such
financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the
certificate, the financial condition of Presidio in all material respects.

Section 5.18 _Shareholder Litigation_. HCC and Presidio shall each
promptly notify the other party in writing of any threatened or commenced
litigation, or of any claim, controversy or contingent liability or complaint
that could reasonably be expected to be asserted or become the subject of a
Legal Action or regulatory review or filings with any Governmental Entity,
against the notifying party or affecting any of its properties, Subsidiaries
or Affiliates. Each of HCC and Presidio shall promptly notify the other party
of any Legal Action, pending or, to the knowledge of the notifying party,
threatened against the notifying party that questions or could question the
validity of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, or any actions
taken or to be taken by the notifying party pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.18_ or seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Each of HCC and Presidio shall
give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense

directors or officers relating to the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions.
Neither HCC or Presidio, may enter into any settlement agreement as to any
shareholder litigation against such party or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions without such
other partys prior written consent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
5.18_, "participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept
reasonably apprised of the proposed strategy and other significant decisions
as to the litigation by the litigating party (to the extent the attorney-
client privilege, work product or other similar privilege between the
litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected and
to the extent permitted by Law), and the non-litigating party may offer
comments or suggestions as to the litigation (which comments and suggestions
shall be reasonably considered) but will not be afforded any decision-making
power or other authority over the litigation, except for the settlement
consent set forth above.

Section 5.19 _Presidio Auditor Cooperation_. Presidio shall cooperate, and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditor to
cooperate, at Presidios expense, with HCC and its independent auditor to
enable HCC to prepare financial statements, including pro forma financial
information for Presidio that may be required by HCC for the filing of
regulatory applications with Governmental Entities or otherwise required for
the Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Presidio agrees that it will (a) consent to the use or
incorporation of such audited and reviewed financial statements in any
registration statement, periodic report or other document that it is required
to be delivered to shareholders of HCC or Presidio, or as otherwise required
to be filed by HCC and (b) execute and deliver, and cause its officers to
execute and deliver, such "representation" letters as are customarily
delivered for audits and as the independent auditors or Presidio or HCC may
respectively commercially reasonably request under the circumstances.

Presidio being able to continue to conduct its operations in the ordinary
course of business and satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth herein,
Presidio shall cooperate with HCC with respect to Real Property Leases and
Material Contracts which may continue in effect following the Effective Time.
If Presidio shall fail to obtain any such Required Third Party Consent,

such actions reasonably requested by HCC, to minimize any material adverse
effect on the consummation of the Merger and the Merger on HCC and its
Subsidiaries businesses and financial condition resulting, or that would be
reasonably likely to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to
obtain such consent.

(b) Presidio shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and

counterpart to a customary trademark assignment for each trademark that

by this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ shall be promptly paid by and shall be the sole
responsibility of Presidio.

 

Section 5.21 _Assignment of Insurance Policies_.

 

(a) Before the Effective Time, Presidio shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain consents to the partial or complete assignments of any of
its insurance policies if requested to do so by HCC, to the extent necessary
to maintain the benefits to HCC and the Surviving Corporation of such policies
as they apply to Presidio. Presidio shall also inform HCC no later than five
business days before the Closing Date of any material unfiled insurance claims
to the knowledge of Presidio, and for which it believes coverage exists.

 

(b) Before the Effective Time if requested by HCC, Presidio and HCC shall
cooperate to determine the most appropriate methodology to obtain "tail"
insurance coverage at such limits, mutually agreeable to the parties, for
Errors and Omissions, Bankers and Blanket Bond coverage and any other
insurance policies of Presidio as mutually agreed.

Section 5.22 _Takeover Provisions_. No party shall take any action that
would cause the Contemplated Transactions to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Provisions, and each party shall, if any Takeover
Provision becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions from or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of any applicable Takeover Provision
as now or hereafter in effect.

reasonable commercial efforts to cause counsel to HCC and counsel to Presidio

shall have received representation letters executed and delivered by the
appropriate executive officers of HCC and Presidio acceptable to such counsel.

 

Section 5.25 _Rule 16b-3_. HCC shall, prior to the Effective Time, take

(f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not,
and the performance by Shareholder of Shareholders obligations under this

violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of
HCC hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with HCC set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by HCC against such third party in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in
equity. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek and agrees to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with HCCs
seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

obligations or liabilities hereunder, except that any such termination shall

prior to such termination.

EXHIBIT A

   

EXHIBIT B-1

NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this "
_Agreement_ "), dated as of May 16, 2019, is made by and among Heritage
Commerce Corp, a California corporation (" _HCC_ "), Heritage Bank of
Commerce, a California state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of

Bank, a California banking corporation (" _Presidio_ "). This Agreement shall
become effective on the Effective Time of the Merger (defined below).

_RECITALS_

 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Presidio and HCC are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of
the date hereof, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Presidio
shall merge with and into Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California chartered
banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of HCC (the " _Merger_ ")
and, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Presidio Common

restricted stock units of Presidio (" _RSUs_ ") that will be converted into
shares of HCC common as provided in the Merger Agreement. Director holds stock
options issued by Presidio that will be assumed by HCC and become exercisable
into HCC Common Stock as provided in the Merger Agreement. Therefore, Director
is entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

C. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of HCC and HBC to
enter into the Merger Agreement, and to protect the goodwill, trade secrets
and other intellectual property of Presidio from and after the Effective Time
of the Merger, Director agrees to refrain from competing with and using trade
secrets or soliciting customers or employees of Presidio and, from and after
the Effective Time of the Merger, HBC as successor to Presidio, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 

D. Director and HCC and HBC intend for the provisions of this Agreement to
be in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601
and further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and respective
representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and conditions contained
herein and in the merger agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Director, HCC and HBC agree as follows:

Section 1. _Definitions_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
capitalized term shall have the meaning given to such term in the Merger
Agreement. As used in this Agreement the following terms have the following
meanings.

 

" _Applicable Period_ " means from and after the Effective Time of the Merger
for the period ending 24 months after the Effective Time of the Merger.

 



B-1-1

    

" _Customer_ " means any Person with whom Presidio has an existing
relationship for Financial Services (as defined below) from the date of
execution of the Merger Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger.

 

" _Business_ " means the provision of Financial Services conducted by Presidio
at any time from the date of execution of the Merger Agreement until

" _Financial Institution_ " means a "depository institution" as that term is
defined in 12 C.F.R. Section 348.2, and any parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof.

 

" _Financial Services_ " means any banking or financial services provided by a
Financial Institution (including any Financial Institution in formation),
including the origination, purchasing, selling and servicing of commercial,
real estate, residential, construction, consumer and other loans; the
issuance, origination, sale and servicing of letters of credit; the
solicitation and provision of deposit services and services related thereto;
and the provision of wire transfer, direct payment, foreign currency exchange,
and other customary community banking services provided by Presidio prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger.

" _Prospective Customer_ " means any Person with whom Presidio, to Directors
knowledge, has specifically pursued a relationship to provide Financial

Prospective Customers, the identity of Customers and Prospective Customers,
broker lists, potential brokers, rate sheets, plans, concepts, strategies or
products, as well as all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans and
proposals otherwise pertaining to same or relating to the business and
properties of Presidio and HCC, HBC and their respective Subsidiaries of which
Director has acquired, or may hereafter acquire, knowledge and possession as
a shareholder, director, officer or employee of Presidio or, if applicable,
HCC or HBC, or as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 

Section 2. _Acknowledgements by Director_ : Director acknowledges that:

 

(a) HCC and HBC would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless Director
agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or similar to
the Business in violation of this Agreement. This Agreement is a material
inducement for HCC and HBC to enter into the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,
Director is entering into this Agreement with HCC and HBC to induce each of
them to enter into the Merger Agreement.

(b) By virtue of Directors position with Presidio, Director has developed
considerable expertise in the business operations of Presidio and has access
to Trade Secrets of Presidio. Director recognizes that HCC and HBC would be
irreparably damaged, and its substantial investment in Presidio materially
impaired, if Director were to disclose or make use of any Trade Secrets in
violation of the terms of this Agreement, or if Director were to solicit
employees of Presidio or HBC as successor to Presidio from and after the
Effective Time of the Merger in violation of the terms of this Agreement.
Accordingly, Director is voluntarily entering into this Agreement and
acknowledge that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director in all respects.

Section 3. _Non-competition_. During the Applicable Period, Director

principal, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, trustee,
employee, advisor, consultant, agent, or representative of or with, any
Financial Institution engaged in providing Financial Services in the
Restricted Area. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary Director shall not
be prohibited from making a passive investment not to exceed 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of another Financial
Institution.

 

Section 4. _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period on behalf of
any Financial Institution, Director will not directly or indirectly without
the prior consent of HBC (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld by
HBC):

 

(a) take any affirmative action to attempt to solicit for hire (in any
capacity), any Person who was an officer or employee of Presidio or, from and
after the Effective Time of the Merger, HBC as successor to Presidio;

 

(b) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any Customer or Prospective
Customer for Financial Services, or

(c) induce or attempt to induce any Person who is a Customer or Prospective
Customer, or induce or attempt to induce any supplier, distributor, officer
or employee of Presidio as of the date of this Agreement or immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger or HBC, as applicable, in each case, to
terminate such Persons relationships with HBC as successor to Presidio or
disparage the goodwill of HCC, HBC or Presidio. As used in this Agreement "
_solicitation_ " or " _solicit_ " includes by personal contact, telephone,
facsimile, social media, internet, mail, email or other form of communication
specifically directed to the employee, Customer or Prospective Customer.

 

The prohibitions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or the general advertising or general solicitations not
specifically directed at such Person(s).

 

Section 5. _Trade Secrets_.

 

(a) Other than for the benefit of Presidio, or as otherwise approved by
Presidio, and, after the Effective Time of the Merger, other than for the
benefit of HCC and/or HBC or as otherwise approved by HCC or HBC (at their
respective sole and absolute discretion) in writing, Director (i) shall make
no use of the Trade Secrets, or any part thereof, (ii) shall not disclose the
Trade Secrets, or any part thereof, to any other Person and (iii) shall
deliver, on and after the Effective Time of the Merger, upon the request of
HBC, all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and other
tangible evidence of Trade Secrets, now possessed or hereafter acquired by
Director, to HBC.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Director may disclose or reveal any information, whether including in whole
or in part any Trade Secrets, that Director is required to disclose or reveal
under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or reveal by any
Governmental Entity, provided that Director makes a good faith request that
the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and, to the extent not
prohibited by any applicable Law, gives HBC prompt notice of such requirement
in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts to preserve
the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, including, by reasonably
cooperating with HCC and HBC to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Trade Secrets by the Governmental Entity or other recipient of the Trade
Secrets.

 



B-1-3

    

(c) Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for
the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made in confidence to a federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Further,
an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for
reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court
proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret
under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court
order.

 

Section 6. _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants of Director set
forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement between Director, on the one hand, and HCC or HBC on
the other, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Director
against Presidio, HCC, HBC, or any of their respective Affiliates (or the
existence of any claim or cause of action by HCC or HBC against Director, as
the case may be), shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such
covenants against Director, or against HCC or HBC, as applicable.

Section 7. _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Director under _Section_ __ _ 3_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period.

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, and except as provided in _subsection_ __ _ (b)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Director under this Agreement shall
terminate only on the mutual agreement of Director, on the one hand, and HCC
or HBC, on the other hand.

Section 8. _Specific Performance_. Director acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to HCC and HBC in the event of a breach of any
of the provisions of this Agreement and that HCC and HBC may have no adequate
remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedy HCC and HBC may have, Director agrees that the entry of a preliminary
injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation,
specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the
violation or breach thereof by Director or any Affiliates, agents, or any
other persons acting for or with Director in any capacity whatsoever, is an
appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Director will not oppose the
granting of such relief on the basis that HCC and HBC has an adequate remedy
at law. Director submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.
In addition, HCC and HBC shall have the right to inform any third party that
HCC and HBC reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating
with Director or receiving from Director assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of HCC and HBC under
this Agreement, and that participation by any such persons with Director in
activities in violation of Directors agreement with HCC and HBC set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by HCC and HBC against such third
party in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or
in equity.

 



B-1-4

    

Section 9. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party to this Agreement. No waiver of any
provisions of this Agreement by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any
other provisions of this Agreement by any such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision of this Agreement by
such party.

 

(b) _Attorney s Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
be entitled to attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party is entitled.

 

(c) _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 and
Section_ __ _ 5_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement
is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that, although Director, HCC
and HBC each consider the restrictions contained in _Section_ __ _ 3,
Section_ __ _ 4 and Section_ __ _ 5_ to be reasonable, if a final
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator
that any restriction contained in _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or
Section_ __ _ 5_ is unenforceable against any party, the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or Section_ __ _ 5 (as applicable)_ shall
be deemed amended to apply to the maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to
duration, activity or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the
maximum duration, range of activities or subjects as to which such provision
shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given
(i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) transmitters
confirmation of a receipt of a transmission to the email address sent below,
(iii) four days after having been sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one business day after
deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next
business day delivery, with written verification of receipt. All
communications shall be sent to the respective parties at their address as set
forth below, or to such email address or address as subsequently modified by
written notice given under this  _Section_ __ _ 9(d)_.

_RECITALS_

 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Presidio and HCC are

and, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Presidio Common

into HCC Common Stock as provided in the Merger Agreement. Therefore, Director
is entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

C. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of HCC and HBC to
enter into the Merger Agreement, and to protect the goodwill, trade secrets
and other intellectual property of Presidio from and after the Effective Time

be in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601
and further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or reveal by any
Governmental Entity, provided that Director makes a good faith request that

B-2-3

by the Governmental Entity or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.

 

(c) Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), an individual shall not be held

state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Further, an
individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of

Section 6. _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants of Director set
forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other

against Presidio, HCC, HBC, or any of their respective Affiliates (or the
existence of any claim or cause of action by HCC or HBC against Director, as
the case may be), shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such
covenants against Director, or against HCC or HBC, as applicable.

Section 7. _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Director under _Section_ __ _ 3_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period.

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, and except as provided in _subsection_ __ _ (b)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Director under this Agreement shall
terminate only on the mutual agreement of Director, on the one hand, and HCC
or HBC, on the other hand.

Section 8. _Specific Performance_. Director acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to HCC and HBC in the event of a breach of any
of the provisions of this Agreement and that HCC and HBC may have no adequate
remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedy HCC and HBC may have, Director agrees that the entry of a preliminary
injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation,
specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the
violation or breach thereof by Director or any Affiliates, agents, or any
other persons acting for or with Director in any capacity whatsoever, is an
appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Director will not oppose the
granting of such relief on the basis that HCC and HBC has an adequate remedy
at law. Director submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.
In addition, HCC and HBC shall have the right to inform any third party that
HCC and HBC reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating
with Director or receiving from Director assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of HCC and HBC under
this Agreement, and that participation by any such persons with Director in
activities in violation of Directors agreement with HCC and HBC set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by HCC and HBC against such third
party in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or
in equity.

 



B-2-4

    

Section 9. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party to this Agreement. No waiver of any
provisions of this Agreement by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any
other provisions of this Agreement by any such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision of this Agreement by
such party.

 

(b) _Attorney s Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
be entitled to attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party is entitled.

 

(c) _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 and
Section_ __ _ 5_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement
is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that, although Director, HCC
and HBC each consider the restrictions contained in _Section_ __ _ 3,
Section_ __ _ 4 and Section_ __ _ 5_ to be reasonable, if a final
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator
that any restriction contained in _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or
Section_ __ _ 5_ is unenforceable against any party, the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or Section_ __ _ 5 (as applicable)_ shall
be deemed amended to apply to the maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to
duration, activity or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the
maximum duration, range of activities or subjects as to which such provision
shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given
(i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) transmitters
confirmation of a receipt of a transmission to the email address sent below,
(iii) four days after having been sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one business day after
deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next
business day delivery, with written verification of receipt. All
communications shall be sent to the respective parties at their address as set
forth below, or to such email address or address as subsequently modified by
written notice given under this  _Section_ __ _ 9(d)_.

or in part any Trade Secrets, that Executive is required to disclose or reveal

the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and, to the extent not
prohibited by any applicable Law, gives HBC prompt notice of such requirement
in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts to preserve

Secrets.

order.

 

Section 6. _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants of Executive set
forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement between Executive, on the one hand, and HCC or HBC on

existence of any claim or cause of action by HCC or HBC against Executive, as
the case may be), shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such
covenants against Executive, or against HCC or HBC, as applicable.

Section 7. _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Executive under _Section_ __ _ 3_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period.

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7_, and except as provided in _subsection_ __ _ (b)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 7_, the obligations of Executive under this Agreement shall
terminate only on the mutual agreement of Executive, on the one hand, and HCC
or HBC, on the other hand.

Section 8. _Specific Performance_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to HCC and HBC in the event of a breach of any
of the provisions of this Agreement and that HCC and HBC may have no adequate
remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedy HCC and HBC may have, Executive agrees that the entry of a preliminary
injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation,
specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the
violation or breach thereof by Executive or any Affiliates, agents, or any
other persons acting for or with Executive in any capacity whatsoever, is
an appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Executive will not oppose
the granting of such relief on the basis that HCC and HBC has an adequate
remedy at law. Executive submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such
action. In addition, HCC and HBC shall have the right to inform any third
party that HCC and HBC reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with Executive or receiving from Executive assistance in
violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of
HCC and HBC under this Agreement, and that participation by any such persons
with Executive in activities in violation of Executives agreement with HCC
and HBC set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by HCC and HBC
against such third party in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity.

 



B-3-4

    

Section 9. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party to this Agreement. No waiver of any
provisions of this Agreement by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any
other provisions of this Agreement by any such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision of this Agreement by
such party.

 

(b) _Attorney s Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
be entitled to attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party is entitled.

 

(c) _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 and
Section_ __ _ 5_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement
is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that, although Executive,
HCC and HBC each consider the restrictions contained in _Section_ __ _ 3,
Section_ __ _ 4 and Section_ __ _ 5_ to be reasonable, if a final
determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator
that any restriction contained in _Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or
Section_ __ _ 5_ is unenforceable against any party, the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3, Section_ __ _ 4 or Section_ __ _ 5_ (as applicable) shall
be deemed amended to apply to the maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement
shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to
duration, activity or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the
maximum duration, range of activities or subjects as to which such provision
shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given
(i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) transmitters
confirmation of a receipt of a transmission to the email address sent below,

SCHEDULE B-3

 

(Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disclosure Agreement)

   

EXHIBIT B-4

 

Form of Non-Solicitation and Non-Disclosure Agreement for Certain Executive
Officers

listed on Schedule B-4

 

NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "),
dated as of May 16, 2019, is made by and among Heritage Commerce Corp, a
California corporation (" _HCC_ "), Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California
state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of HCC (" _HBC_ "), and the
undersigned executive ("Executive") of Presidio Bank, a California banking
corporation (" _Presidio_ "). This Agreement shall become effective on the
Effective Time of the Merger (defined below).

_RECITALS_

 

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Presidio and HCC are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of
the date hereof, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Presidio
shall merge with and into Heritage Bank of Commerce, a California chartered
banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of HCC (the " _Merger_ ")
and, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Presidio Common
Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

B. Executive is an executive officer of Presidio and beneficial owner of
Presidio common stock and is entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.
Executive holds restricted stock units of Presidio (" _RSUs_ ") that will be
converted into shares of HCC common as provided in the Merger Agreement.
Executive holds stock options issued by Presidio that will be assumed by HCC
and become exercisable into HCC Common Stock as provided in the Merger
Agreement. Executive is also receiving certain change in control and/or other
payments under Executives current employment agreement with Presidio dated
[*], which contract is not being assumed by HBC. Therefore, Executive is
entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

C. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of HCC and HBC to
enter into the Merger Agreement, and to protect the goodwill, trade secrets
and other intellectual property of Presidio from and after the Effective Time
of the Merger, Executive agrees to refrain from using trade secrets or
soliciting customers or employees of Presidio and, from and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, HBC as successor to Presidio, in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

 

D. Executive and HCC and HBC intend for the provisions of this Agreement to
be in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601
and further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and respective
representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and conditions contained
herein and in the merger agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Executive, HCC and HBC agree as follows:

Section 1. _Definitions_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
capitalized term shall have the meaning given to such term in the Merger
Agreement. As used in this Agreement the following terms have the following
meanings.

for the period ending 24 months after the Effective Time of the Merger.

" _Customer_ " means any Person with whom Presidio has an existing
relationship for Financial Services (as defined below) from the date of

solicitation and provision of deposit services and services related thereto;
and the provision of wire transfer, direct payment, foreign currency exchange,
and other customary community banking services provided by Presidio prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger.

" _Prospective Customer_ " means any Person with whom Presidio,
to Executives knowledge, has specifically pursued a relationship to provide

Section 2. _Acknowledgements by Executive_ : Executive acknowledges that:

 

(a) HCC and HBC would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless Executive
agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or similar to

inducement for HCC and HBC to enter into the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,
Executive is entering into this Agreement with HCC and HBC to induce each of
them to enter into the Merger Agreement.

(b) By virtue of Executives position with Presidio, Executive has
developed considerable expertise in the business operations of Presidio and
has access to Trade Secrets of Presidio. Executive recognizes that HCC and HBC
would be irreparably damaged, and its substantial investment in Presidio
materially impaired, if Executive were to disclose or make use of any Trade
Secrets in violation

 



B-4-2

    

 of the terms of this Agreement, or if Executive were to solicit employees of
Presidio or HBC as successor to Presidio from and after the Effective Time of
the Merger in violation of the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly,
Executive is voluntarily entering into this Agreement and acknowledge that the
terms and conditions of this Agreement are fair and reasonable to Executive in
all respects.

 

Section 3. _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period on behalf of
any Financial Institution, Executive will not directly or indirectly:

terminate such Persons relationships with HBC as successor to Presidio or
disparage the goodwill of HCC, HBC or Presidio. As used in this Agreement "

facsimile, social media, internet, mail, email or other form of communication
specifically addressed to the employee, Customer or Prospective Customer.

 

The prohibitions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or the general advertising or general solicitations not
specifically directed at such Person(s).

 

Section 4. _Trade Secrets_.

 

(a) Other than for the benefit of Presidio, or as otherwise approved by
Presidio, and, after the Effective Time of the Merger, other than for the
benefit of HCC and/or HBC or as otherwise approved by HCC or HBC (at their
respective sole and absolute discretion) in writing, Executive (i) shall make
no use of the Trade Secrets, or any part thereof, (ii) shall not disclose the
Trade Secrets, or any part thereof, to any other Person and (iii) shall
deliver, on and after the Effective Time of the Merger, upon the request of
HBC, all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and other
tangible evidence of Trade Secrets, now possessed or hereafter acquired by
Executive, to HBC.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Executive may disclose or reveal any information, whether including in whole
or in part any Trade Secrets, that Executive is required to disclose or reveal
under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or reveal by any
Governmental Entity, provided that Executive makes a good faith request that
the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and, to the extent not
prohibited by any applicable Law, gives HBC prompt notice of such requirement
in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts to preserve
the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, including, by reasonably
cooperating with HCC and HBC to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Trade Secrets by the Governmental Entity or other recipient of the Trade
Secrets.

(c) Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for
the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made in confidence to a federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.

 



B-4-3

    

 Further, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer
for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to
the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the
court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to
court order.

 

Section 5. _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants of Executive set
forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement between Executive, on the one hand, and HCC or HBC on
the other, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive
against Presidio, HCC, HBC, or any of their respective Affiliates (or the
existence of any claim or cause of action by HCC or HBC against Executive, as
the case may be), shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such
covenants against Executive, or against HCC or HBC, as applicable.

Section 6. _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6_, the obligations of Executive under _Section_ __ _ 3_
shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period.

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under _subsection_ __ _ (a)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6_, and except as provided in _subsection_ __ _ (b)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 6_, the obligations of Executive under this Agreement shall
terminate only on the mutual agreement of Executive, on the one hand, and HCC
or HBC, on the other hand.

Section 7. _Specific Performance_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to HCC and HBC in the event of a breach of any
of the provisions of this Agreement and that HCC and HBC may have no adequate
remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedy HCC and HBC may have, Executive agrees that the entry of a preliminary
injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation,
specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the
violation or breach thereof by Executive or any Affiliates, agents, or any
other persons acting for or with Executive in any capacity whatsoever, is
an appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Executive will not oppose
the granting of such relief on the basis that HCC and HBC has an adequate
remedy at law. Executive submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such
action. In addition, HCC and HBC shall have the right to inform any third
party that HCC and HBC reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with Executive or receiving from Executive assistance in
violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of
HCC and HBC under this Agreement, and that participation by any such persons
with Executive in activities in violation of Executives agreement with HCC
and HBC set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by HCC and HBC
against such third party in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 8. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party to this Agreement. No waiver of any
provisions of this Agreement by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any
other provisions of this Agreement by any such party, nor shall any such
waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision of this Agreement by
such party.

 



B-4-4

    

(b) _Attorney s Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
be entitled to attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party is entitled.

 

(c) _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3 and Section_ __ _ 4_
shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public
policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly
understood and agreed that, although Executive, HCC and HBC each consider the
restrictions contained in _Section_ __ _ 3 and Section_ __ _ 4 _to be
reasonable, if a final determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator that any restriction contained in _Section_ __
_ 3 and Section_ __ _ 4 _is unenforceable against any party, the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 3 and Section_ __ _ 4_ (as applicable) shall be deemed
amended to apply to the maximum extent as such court may judicially determine
or indicate to be enforceable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration,
activity or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum
duration, range of activities or subjects as to which such provision shall be
valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement
shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Notices_. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given
(i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) transmitters
confirmation of a receipt of a transmission to the email address sent below,

return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (iv) one business day after

 Options shall be assumed by HCC on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the corresponding Presidio Stock Option
immediately before the Effective Time, except that after the Effective Time
(i) each Assumed Option shall be exercisable (or shall become exercisable by
its terms) for a number of shares of HCC Common Stock equal to the product of

Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole share and (ii) the per share exercise price for the HCC Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price for such Presidio
Stock Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Time by (B) the Per
Share Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. The term " _Presidio
Equity Plans_ " means the Presidio 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and the Presidio

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time each outstanding
restricted stock unit (" _Restricted Stock Units_ ") granted by Presidio to

into the right to acquire shares of HCC Common Stock at the Effective Time.
The number of shares of HCC Common Stock subject to each Restricted Stock Unit
shall be equal to the number of shares of Presidio Common Stock subject to
the Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Closing Date multiplied by
the Per Share Exchange Ratio, which number of shares of HCC Common Stock shall
be delivered to the holders of Restricted Stock Units at Closing, together
with cash in lieu of any fractional shares.

(c) _Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
vesting conditions applicable to each award of restricted common stock of
Presidio granted under a Presidio Equity Plan shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof and consistent with the terms of
the Presidio Equity Plan, accelerate in full and such restricted stock shall
become free of any restrictions and any repurchase right shall lapse, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive shares of HCC Common Stock in
accordance with the Per Share Exchange Ratio, together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such vesting.
