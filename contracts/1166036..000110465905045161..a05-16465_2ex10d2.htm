twenty (120) **** days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the Seller (i) a good faith statement, including
reasonable detail, of the actual Purchase Price (such statement, as it may be
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2(e)(ii)_, the " ** _Closing Statement_**

Capital, Purchase Price Increases and Purchase Price Decreases, in each case
of the Acquired Companies, and any other reasonable detail. In connection
with the preparation of the Closing Statement, the Seller shall measure the
Product Inventory quantities in its control as of the Effective Time, and the
Buyers representatives shall be given reasonable advance notice of, and
shall be permitted to attend and observe, such measurement and to have
reasonable access to documentation of Product Inventory positions prepared by
the Seller and other Persons (to the extent the Seller has the Legal Right or
other legal authority and right to access such Persons documentation). In

Closing, the Seller shall make a good faith estimate of the Product Inventory
quantities

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

### and the related Product Inventory Value Amount, which information shall
be attached to the Interim Closing Statement. By way of example, _Schedule
2(e)_ is a hypothetical Interim Closing Statement that assumes the Closing
occurred on March 31, 2005.

  

### 

  

### (ii) Upon receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller and the Sellers
independent accountants shall be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60)
**-** day period to examine the work papers used or generated in connection
with the preparation of the Closing Statement and such other documents as the
Seller may reasonably request in connection with its review of the Closing
Statement, including the income statements for the Acquired Companies. Within
sixty (60) days of receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller shall deliver
to the Buyer a written statement describing in reasonable detail its
objections (if any) to any amounts or items set forth on the Closing
Statement.  Additionally, if the Buyer receives a timely objection to the
proposed Closing Statement pursuant to the comparable provision of the Other
Purchase Agreements, the Buyer shall provide notice to the Seller of
objection notice and, if then elected by the Seller, the Seller shall be
deemed to have timely made the same objection to the Closing Statement made
under the Other Purchase Agreements. If the Buyer does not receive, within
sixty (60) days of the Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Sellers written statement describing in reasonable detail the Sellers
objections (and the Seller is not deemed to have timely objected pursuant to
the preceding sentence), the Closing Statement shall become final and
binding. If the Seller raises written objections within the 60-day period (or
the Seller is deemed to have timely objected pursuant to the preceding
sentence), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objections. If the Parties are unable to resolve any disputed item, other
than matters involving the application or interpretation of the Law or other
provisions of this Agreement, within thirty (30) days after the Buyers
receipt of the Sellers written objections, any such disputed items shall be
submitted to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
agreeable to the Parties who shall be instructed to resolve such disputed
item in accordance with GAAP within thirty (30) days. The resolution of such
disputes (as limited in the preceding sentence) shall be set forth in writing
and shall be conclusive, binding and non-appealable upon the Parties and the
Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the date of such
resolution. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be paid one-
half by the Buyer and one-half by the Seller. The Parties agree that any
disputed item related to the application or interpretation of the Law or
other provisions of this Agreement shall not be resolved by the designated
accounting firm.

  

### 

  

### (iii) If the Purchase Price as set forth on the Closing Statement exceeds
the estimated Purchase Price as set forth on the Interim Closing Statement,
the Buyer shall pay the Seller, without offset or deduction, in cash the
amount of such excess. If the estimated Purchase Price as set forth on the
Interim Closing Statement exceeds the Purchase Price as set forth on the
Closing Statement, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer, without offset or
deduction, in cash the amount of such excess. After giving effect to the
foregoing adjustments, any amount to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller, or
to be paid by the Seller to the Buyer, as the case may be, shall be paid in
the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 2(e)(iv)_ at a mutually
convenient time and place within five (5) business days after the later of
acceptance of the Closing Statement or the resolution of the
Sellers objections thereto pursuant to _Section 2(e)(ii)_).

  

### 

  

### (iv) Any payments pursuant to this _Section 2(e)_ shall be made by
causing such payments to be credited in immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of the Buyer

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

### or the Seller, as the case may be, as may be designated by the Buyer or
the Seller, as the case may be. The amount of the payment to be made
pursuant to this _Section 2(e)_ shall bear interest from and including the
Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of payment at a rate per annum equal
to the Prime Rate plus two (2) percent (not to exceed the maximum rate
permitted by applicable Law). Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of three hundred sixty five (365) days and the actual number of days
for which due.

  

### 

  

### (v) Except as set forth in _Section 2(e)(ii)_, each Party shall bear
its own expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and review of
the Closing Statement.

  

### 

  

(f) _Retained Assets_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclude each and
every right, title, interest or other asset in any way relating to the
matters described below to the extent in any way owned by, or that in any way
accrued to the benefit of, any Acquired Company (other than those actually
owned by the Javelina Partnerships) (including their respective successors)

any of its Affiliates relating to any analysis of the Buyers bid or offer
and any analysis of any other bids or offers with respect to any such

including those in competition with the Buyers bid or offer.

  

### 

  

Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause any such Acquired Company
to transfer, for or without consideration, the Retained Assets to the Seller,
any of its Affiliates or any designee.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the term Acquired Company
Assets does not include (and similar terms or phrases contained in the
Transaction Agreements shall not include) the Retained Assets, and,
accordingly, the Sellers representations, warranties and covenants shall not
apply to the Retained Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, but
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates is assuming or otherwise becoming responsible for any
Obligation pursuant to this **_Section 2(f)_**;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the Seller is providing the indemnification specified in
_Section 8(b)(vii)(B)_ relating to the Retained Assets.

actively is pursuing, contesting or defending against any third party action,
suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand

(ii) any Retained Assets or (iii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or before the Closing Date relating

pursuing, contesting or defending Party and its counsel in such pursuit,
defense or contest, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records (other than books and records which are
subject to privilege or to confidentiality restrictions) as shall be
necessary in connection with such pursuit, defense or contest, all at the
sole cost and expense of the pursuing, contesting or defending Party (unless
the pursuing, contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under _Section 8_).

  



  

(c) _Delivery and Retention of Records_.  Within forty-five (45) days after

time as may be required by Law, _provided_  that, if it desires to destroy or
dispose of such Records during such period, it shall first offer in writing
at least sixty (60) days before such destruction or disposition to surrender
them to the Seller and if the Seller does not accept such offer within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such offer, the Buyer may take such action and
(ii) following the Closing Date to afford the Seller, its accountants, and
counsel, during normal business hours, upon reasonable request, full access
to the Records and to the Buyers employees to the extent that such access
may be requested for any legitimate purpose at no cost to the Seller (other
than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); _provided_ that such access shall
not be construed to require the disclosure of Records that would cause the
waiver of any attorney-client, work product, or like privilege or cause the
breach of any confidentiality agreement; _provided_ , further that in the
event of any litigation nothing herein shall limit either Partys rights of
discovery under applicable Law. All post-Closing access to the Records and
to the Buyers employees will be subject to confidentiality obligations under

it obtains no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever

Marks, including any rights, title, interest or license to use any Kerr
Marks. The Buyer will not do any business or offer any goods or services
under the Kerr Marks. The Buyer will not send, or cause to be sent, any
correspondence or other materials to any Person on any stationery that
contains any Kerr Marks or otherwise operate any Acquired Company in any
manner which would or might confuse any Person into believing that the Buyer
has any right, title, interest, or license to use the Kerr Marks. Within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall remove the
Kerr Marks from the pipeline and facility markers, decals, logos and other
signage on the real and personal property of each Acquired Company referring

Buyer or the appropriate Acquired Company, any amounts received by the Seller
and its Affiliates after Closing that relate to the business or operations of

will promptly, after receipt thereof, pay, or cause the Acquired Companies to
pay, to the Seller any amounts (or, in the case of the Javelina Partnerships,

its Affiliates and the Javelina Partnerships after Closing that should have
been paid to the Seller or its Affiliates.

  



  

(f) _Accounts Receivable_. To the extent any Acquired Company receives cash
payments with respect to its accounts receivable that were excluded from
Working Capital, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Acquired
Company to, promptly remit such payments (or, in the case of the Javelina
Partnerships, the Javelina Percentage Interest of such payments) to the
Seller. Towards this end, the Seller shall have the right for two (2) years
after the Closing

has the Legal Right), as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer,
in connection with such reports, filings, or certifications to be made by the
Buyer.

  



  

(h) _Mutual Mistake_. If the Parties determine that the Seller and its

Acquired Company Asset, the Parties will cooperate to effect such transfer as
promptly as practical.

  



  

(i) _Real Property Matters_.  Except as represented and warranted under

title documents, contracts, laws or otherwise) providing title claims against
the Seller and any of its Affiliates that is a predecessor in title of any
Acquired Company and (ii) release, forgive and otherwise discharge and
otherwise not pursue any claim, right or other cause of action in favor of it
or its Affiliates against the Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent
same relates to title to any such real property interests.

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

environmental or other claims under such policies, which claims (including

other substantial tangible asset) that both was owned and divested or
otherwise disposed of by any Acquired Company (other than the Javelina
Partnerships) at any time prior to the Closing Date and (y) the Javelina
Percentage Interest of any Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the

prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(ix) _Seller and Affiliate Claims_. The Seller shall **RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND

out of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, claims with respect to
any Acquired Company Contract or intercompany arrangements that will not be
terminated as of the Closing in accordance with _Section 5(h)_ and claims of
the type for which the Buyer is providing indemnity pursuant to _Section
8(c)_.

  



  

(x) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement, including the rights of
indemnification provided in this _Section 8_, the Seller shall have no
obligation to release, indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to any Adverse Consequence (A) associated with, attributable to or
resulting from any environmental condition or circumstance (including the
non-compliance with any Environmental Law and the presence of any Hazardous
Substance) _except_  to the extent the relevant condition or circumstance
constitutes a breach of the representation and warranty set forth in _Section
4(i)_ or is subject to indemnity in accordance with _Sections 8(b)(vii)-(ix)_
or (B) to the extent relating to the Javelina Partnerships or the
assets, properties, obligations, activities and other matters relating to the
Javelina Partnerships, that portion of such Adverse Consequence in excess of
the product derived by multiplying the Javelina Percentage Interest by the
amount of such Adverse Consequence. By way of clarification, the Parties
acknowledge and agree (1) that the Buyer has entered into a separate purchase
agreement with each partner of the Javelina Partnerships covering such
partners interest in such Javelina Partnerships, and (2) each such purchase
agreement is separate and independent from the others and is not intended to
increase the Sellers exposure for Adverse Consequences, if any. For example,
if it should happen that

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

one of the Javelina Partnerships has an Unrecorded Obligation of $100 that
would constitute a breach of the representation and warranty contained in
_Section 4(l)_, the Sellers maximum exposure with respect thereto (subject
to any deductibles, caps or other limitations) would be determined by
multiplying $100 by the Javelina Percentage Interest.

  



  

(c) _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller_.

  



  

(i) _Representation, Warranties and Covenants_. In the event: (x) the Buyer
breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
obligations contained herein; and (y) the Seller makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to _Section 11(h)_ within the
applicable survival period specified in _Section 8(a)_, then the Buyer
agrees to **RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS** the Seller Indemnitees
from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences that are
individually in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and suffered
by the Seller Indemnitees by reason of such breaches.

  



  

(ii) _General_. Except to the extent the Seller is obligated to indemnify the
Buyer pursuant to _Section 8(b)_, the Buyer agrees to **RELEASE, INDEMNIFY
AND HOLD HARMLESS** the Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of
any Adverse Consequences relating in any way to the Acquired
Companies, Acquired Company Equity Interests, the Acquired Company Assets or
the ownership, operation or Obligations of any of them, in each such case,
whether or not arising during, related to or otherwise attributable to the
period prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
any Adverse Consequences incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnitees
resulting or arising from any such Person serving as a general partner of
either of the Javelina Partnerships. Except as otherwise expressly provided
for in this Agreement, the Buyers Obligations under this _Section 8(c)(ii)_
include and cover matters whether or not they are set forth in the
_Schedules_ to this Agreement, including such Obligations relating to
litigation to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party.

  



  

(iii) _Acquired Company Claims_. The Buyer shall **RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND
HOLD HARMLESS** the Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of
any Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the Seller Indemnitees for
claims by the Acquired Companies against the Seller and its Affiliates
attributable to the period prior to the Closing, except for claims arising
out of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, and claims with respect
to any intercompany arrangements that will not be terminated as of the
Closing in accordance with _Section 5(h)_.

  



  

(iv) _Site Access_. The Buyer agrees to **RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD
HARMLESS** the Seller Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any
Adverse Consequences that are suffered by the Seller Indemnitees arising out
of, resulting from or relating to any field visit or other due diligence
activities relating to any performance of the Diligence Activities to the
extent caused by acts or omissions of any Buyer Party or Buyer Diligence
Representative, even if such Adverse Consequences arise out of or result
from, solely or in part, the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative
negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of Law of or by the
Seller Indemnitees, except Adverse Consequences to the extent resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller Indemnitees.

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

  



  

(i) If any third party shall notify either Party (the " ** _Indemnified
Party_** ") with respect to any matter (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") that
is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification against
the other Party (the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") under this _Section 8_,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
business days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of such claim
is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such
notice, including having the effect of tolling or suspending the statute of
limitations applicable to such claim.

  



  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for
or results in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or for
any damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the
Indemnified Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon
the conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be withheld unreasonably).

  



  

(iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 8(d)(ii)_, the Indemnified Party
may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate.

  



  

(iv) In no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably.

  



  

(e) _Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences_. The Adverse
Consequences giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be
limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party ( _i.e._
 reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
events giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of any expenses
related to the receipt of such proceeds, payment or recoupment, including
retrospective premium adjustments, if any), but not any reduction in Taxes of
the Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a member)
occasioned by such loss or damage. The amount of the actual loss and the
amount of the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the
timing of the loss or payment, as applicable, using a Prime Rate plus two
percent interest or discount rate, as appropriate (not to exceed the maximum
rate permitted by applicable Law).  Upon the request of the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with
information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the
amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this _Section 8(e)_.  An
Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in
respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall
use commercially

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim
and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the
amount thereof. Nothing in this _Section 8_ is intended to allow an
indemnified Person to receive duplicative payments in connection with a
Partys Obligations to release, indemnify and hold harmless. Without in any
way limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, although an
indemnified Person may seek recovery for an Adverse Consequence under any
Section under which such Adverse Consequence may be recoverable, to the
extent an indemnified Person has been paid for an Adverse Consequence under
one _Section _of this Agreement, that Person shall not be permitted to seek
payment for that Adverse Consequence under another _Section _of this
Agreement, even though that Adverse Consequence is of a type which would be
covered by each such _Section_.

  



  

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement, including any payment made under _Section 9_, shall be
made in cash and treated as purchase price adjustments for Tax purposes.

  



  

(g) _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnities provided for in this _Section 8_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party by contract, statute or otherwise, at law or equity, for
any claim, cause of action or other matter arising from any breach by the
Buyer or the Seller, as applicable, of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party acknowledges that the payment of
money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate
compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As the
payment of money shall be adequate compensation, each Party hereby waives any
right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(h) _Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties_. The Buyer acknowledges
that (i) it has had and pursuant to this Agreement shall have before Closing
access to the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Assets and the
officers or other representatives of the Seller and (ii) in making the
decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Buyer has relied solely on the basis of its own
independent investigation, including environmental and other inspections, and
upon the express representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and the Seller expressly disclaims all liability
and responsibility for any representation, warranty, statement or
communication made or communicated (orally or in writing) to the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants or representatives other
than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement
(including, without limitation, any opinion, information, projection or
advice that may have been provided to the Buyer by any officer, director,
employee, agent, consultant, representative or advisor of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates). Toward this end, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no Seller Indemnitee shall have liability to the Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to the Buyer, or the Buyers use
of, any such information relating to any Seller Indemnitee, or prepared by or
on behalf of any Seller Indemnitee, and supplied to the Buyer before the date
of this Agreement, or any information, documents or materials made available
to the Buyer in any data rooms, any presentation or in any other form
relating to the business of the Acquired Companies in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.  Accordingly, the Buyer

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the Seller has not made, and THE SELLER MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY,
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WHETHER BY
COMMON LAW, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING (i) TITLE TO ANY OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANY ASSETS (INCLUDING ANY RIGHTS OF WAY) (WHETHER RELATING TO DEFECTIVE
TITLE OR GAPS IN TITLE), (ii) THE QUALITY, CONDITION, OR OPERABILITY OF ANY
REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, OR FIXTURES, INCLUDING FREEDOM FROM
LATENT OR PATENT VICES OR DEFECTS, (iii) THEIR MERCHANTABILITY, (iv)
THEIR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (v) THEIR CONFORMITY TO
MODELS, SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURER DESIGN, (vi) THE CONTENTS,
CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY REPORT OF ANY PETROLEUM ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS,
OR ANY ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL OR SEISMIC DATA OR INTERPRETATION RELATING TO
ANY ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS, (vii) THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, PRODUCTION
OR RECOVERABILITY OF HYDROCARBONS, (viii) ANY ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF
THE ACQUIRED COMPANY EQUITY INTERESTS OR RELATED ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS OR
FUTURE REVENUES GENERATED THEREFROM, (ix) THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR,
CONDITION, QUALITY SUITABILITY, DESIGN OR MARKETABILITY OF THE ACQUIRED
COMPANY ASSETS, (x) THE CONTENT, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY INFORMATION
MEMORANDUM, REPORTS, BROCHURES, CHARTS OR STATEMENTS PREPARED BY ANY PERSON
WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED COMPANY EQUITY INTERESTS OR ACQUIRED COMPANY
ASSETS, (xi) ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BUYER
OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS,
REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATED THERETO, (xii)
ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FREEDOM FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
INFRINGEMENT, (xiii) ANY RIGHTS OF A PURCHASER UNDER APPROPRIATE STATUTES TO
CLAIM DIMINUTION OF CONSIDERATION OR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, (xiv) ANY
MATTER OR CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, THE RELEASE OF
MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY,
NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE ENVIRONMENT, OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF
THE ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS, AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, ALL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY ASSETS ARE DELIVERED IN THEIR PRESENT
STATUS, CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR, "AS IS, WHERE IS" WITH ALL FAULTS OR
DEFECTS (KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, LATENT, DISCOVERABLE OR UNDISCOVERABLE), INCLUDING
FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THE INCLUSION BY ANY SELLER
PARTY OF ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, OF FAULT, RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND BY ANY SELLER
PARTY UNDER ANY LAW (INCLUDING ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW) FOR ACTS, OMISSIONS,
OBLIGATIONS OR EVENTS INVOLVING THE PRESENCE, IF ANY, OF ANY POLLUTANTS,
CONTAMINANTS, TOXIN OR

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

HAZARDOUS OR EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, MATERIALS, WASTES, CONSTITUENTS,
COMPOUNDS OR CHEMICALS THAT ARE REGULATED BY, OR MAY FORM THE BASIS OF
LIABILITY UNDER, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ON OR ADJACENT TO THE ACQUIRED
COMPANY ASSETS.  The Parties agree that, to the extent required by Law to be
effective, the disclosures contained in this _Section 8(h)_
are "conspicuous" for purposes of any such Laws.

  



  

9. _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed any Post-Closing Tax Returns with
respect to the Acquired Company Assets or the Acquired Companies. The Buyer
shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns.

  



  

(b) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns (x) with
respect to the Acquired Company Assets (other than those of the Javelina
Partnerships) **** or Acquired Companies **(** other than the Javelina
Partnerships) and (y) to the extent it has the Legal Right, with respect to
the Javelina Partnerships or the Acquired Company Assets thereof. The Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid (A) any Taxes due with respect to those Tax
Returns described in _Section 9(b)(x)_ and (B) the Javelina Percentage
Interest of any Taxes due with respect to those Tax Returns described in
_Section 9(b)(y)_.

  



  

(c) _Straddle Periods_. The Buyer shall be responsible for Taxes of the
Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired Companies related to the portion of
any Straddle Period occurring on or after the Effective Time. The
Seller shall be responsible for Taxes of the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies (in each case, with respect to Taxes of the Javelina
Partnerships, solely to the extent of the Javelina Percentage Interest of
such Taxes) relating to the portion of any Straddle Period occurring before
and on the Effective Time. With respect to any such **** Straddle Period, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller or the Buyer shall elect
to treat the close of the day ending immediately prior to the Effective Time
as the last day of the Tax period. If applicable Law shall not permit such
date to be the last day of a period, then (i) real or personal property Taxes
with respect to the Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired Companies shall
be allocated based on the number of days in the partial period before and
after such date, (ii) in the case of all other Taxes based on or in respect
of income, the Tax computed on the basis of the taxable income or loss
attributable to the Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired Companies
for each partial period as determined from their books and records,
and (iii) in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of the
actual activities or attributes of the Acquired Company Assets and the
Acquired Companies for each partial period as determined from their books and
records.

  



  

(d) _Straddle Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare any such ****
Straddle Returns. The Buyer shall deliver, at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Return (including any
extension) to the Seller a statement setting forth the amount of Tax that the
Seller owes, including the allocation of taxable income and Taxes under
_Section 9(c)_, and copies of such Straddle Return. The Seller shall have
the right to review such Straddle Returns and the allocation of taxable
income and liability for Taxes and to suggest to the Buyer any reasonable

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

changes to such Straddle Returns no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
date for the filing of such Straddle Returns. The Seller and the Buyer agree
to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of the review of such Straddle Returns and allocation of taxable
income and liability for Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as
promptly as possible of such Straddle Returns. Not later than five (5) days
before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle
Returns, the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer an amount
equal to the Taxes as agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller as being owed by
the Seller. If the Buyer and the Seller cannot agree on the amount of Taxes
owed by the Seller with respect to a Straddle Return, the Seller shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Buyer the amount of Taxes reasonably determined by
the Seller to be owed by the Seller. Within ten (10) days after such
payment, the Seller and the Buyer shall refer the matter to an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm agreed to by the Buyer and
the Seller to arbitrate the dispute. The Seller and the Buyer shall equally
share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as
to the amount owing by the Seller with respect to a Straddle Return shall be
binding on the Seller and the Buyer. Within five (5) days after the
determination by such accounting firm, if necessary, the appropriate Party
shall pay the other Party any amount which is determined by such accounting
firm to be owed. The Seller shall be entitled to reduce its obligation to pay
Taxes with respect to a Straddle Return by the amount of any estimated Taxes
paid with respect to such Taxes on or before the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Claims for Refund_. The Buyer shall not, and, to the extent the Buyer
has the Legal Right, shall cause the Acquired Companies and any of their
Affiliates not to, file any claim for refund of Taxes with respect to the
Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired Companies for whole or partial
taxable periods on or before the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Indemnification_. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller against all
Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired Company Assets and the Acquired
Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Straddle
Period occurring after the Effective Time. The Seller agrees to indemnify
the Buyer against all Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired Company Assets
and the Acquired Companies (in each case, with respect to Taxes of the
Javelina Partnerships, solely to the extent of the Javelina Percentage
Interest of such Taxes) **** for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion
of any Straddle Period occurring on or before the Effective Time (including
any Tax liability associated with any matter listed on _Schedules 4(f)_ and
_4(h)_ ), and the Buyer Parties against all Taxes of or with respect to the
Retained Assets.

  



  

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 9(g)_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller shall (A) retain all books and records in
their possession **** with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each Acquired
Company relating to any whole or partial taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) give the other Party
reasonable written notice prior to

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records.

  



  

(ii) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

(iii) The Buyer and the Seller agree, upon request, to provide the other
Parties with all information that such other Parties may be required to
report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(h) _Certain Taxes_. The Seller shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees, pay the related Tax,
and, if required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller, on or before the date such
payments are due from the Seller to a Governmental Authority, any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(i) _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, tax audits, tax claims
and tax litigation, or as required by Law.

  



  

(j) _Audits_. The Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to the other Parties of any pending or threatened tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to the Acquired
Company Assets or the Acquired Companies for whole or partial periods for
which it is indemnified by the other Party hereunder. Such notice shall
contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any
notice or other document received from or with any tax authority in respect
of any such matters. If an Indemnified Party has knowledge of an asserted tax
liability with respect to a matter for which it is to be indemnified
hereunder and such Party fails to give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice
of such asserted tax liability, then (I) if the Indemnifying Party is
precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted
tax liability in any forum, the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Taxes arising out of such asserted
tax liability, and (II) if the Indemnifying Party is not so precluded from
contesting, but such failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to
the Indemnifying Party, then any amount which the Indemnifying Party
is otherwise required to pay the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
9(j)_ shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment, _provided_ , the
Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to full indemnification
hereunder to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Party can
establish that the Indemnifying Party was not prejudiced by such failure.
This _Section 9(j)_ shall control the procedure for Tax indemnification
matters to the extent it is inconsistent with any other provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

(k) _Control of Proceedings_. The Party responsible for the Tax under this
Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including
action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). The Seller and
the Buyer shall jointly control, in good faith with each other, audits and
disputes relating to Straddle Periods. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
with respect to such contests shall be borne by the Seller and the Buyer in
proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the noncontrolling
Party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in such
proceedings at its own expense.

  



  

(l) _Powers of Attorney_. To the extent the Buyer has the Legal Right, the
Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates shall provide
the Seller and its Affiliates with such powers of attorney or other
authorizing documentation as are reasonably necessary to empower them to
execute and file returns they are responsible for hereunder, file refund and
equivalent claims for Taxes they are responsible for, and contest, settle,
and resolve any audits and disputes that they have control over under
_Section 9(k)_ (including any refund claims which turn into audits or
disputes).

  



  

(m) _Remittance of Refunds_. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer
receives a refund of any Taxes that the Seller is responsible for hereunder,
or if the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller receives a refund of any
Taxes that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the Party receiving such
refund shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund, remit it
to the Party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose
of this  _Section 9(m)_, the term "refund" shall include a reduction in
Tax and the use of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and
receipt of a refund shall occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an
adjustment thereto using such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the
receipt of cash.

  



  

(n) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Seller and the Buyer agree that the
actual Purchase Price allocable to the Acquired Company Assets shall be
allocated to the Acquired Company Assets for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting purposes) as jointly agreed between the Buyer and the
Seller within 90 days after the Closing Date. The Seller and the Buyer
agree (i) to report the federal, state and local income and other
Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated herein, and in particular
to report the information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to
jointly prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in
a manner consistent with such allocation and (ii) without the consent of the
other Party, not to take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination
of any Tax return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or
otherwise. The Seller and the Buyer agree that each will furnish the other a
copy of Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) proposed
to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service by such Party or any Affiliate
thereof within ten days prior to the filing of such form with the Internal
Revenue Service. The Buyer, the Seller and their applicable Affiliates will
file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund)
and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation.

  



  

(o) _Closing Tax Certificate_. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer a certificate, in the form of _Exhibits D-1_ , _D-2_ and _D-3_ ,
signed under penalties of perjury (i) stating it is not a foreign
corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate, (ii)
providing

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

its U.S. Employer Identification Number, and (iii) providing its address, all
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

  



  

(p) _Reporting of Post-Closing Transactions_. The Buyer and the Seller agree
to report all transactions not in the Ordinary Course of Business occurring
on the Closing Date after the Closing on the Buyers federal income Tax
Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

  



  

(q) _Settlements_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Seller shall not be entitled to settle or concede, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any proceeding
related to Taxes in a manner that could increase the amount of Taxes of the
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Periods,
unless (i) the Buyer consents to such settlement or concession or (ii) the
Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer for any such increase in the amount of
Taxes of the Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies for Post-Closing Tax
Periods.

  



  

(r) _Section 754 Elections_. To the extent it has the Legal Right, the
Seller shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are requested by the
Buyer in order to cause any Acquired Company that is treated as a partnership
for federal tax purposes to make a timely election under Section 754 of the
Code with respect to the Sellers sale of interests in any such entity to the
Buyer hereunder.

  



  

10. _Termination_.

  



  

(a) _Termination of Agreement_. The Parties may terminate this Agreement, as
provided below:

  



  

(i) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent at any
time before the Closing;

  



  

(ii) (A) by either Party in writing, without liability to the other Party on
account of such termination (provided the terminating Party is not in default
or breach of any of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement), if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before 5:00 p.m. Houston, Texas time on December 1, 2005;

  



  

(iii) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Seller at any time before Closing in the event the Seller has materially
breached any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3(a)_ or 
_Section 4_ or any covenant contained in this Agreement, the Buyer has
notified the Seller of the breach, the breach is not curable, or, if curable,
has continued without cure for a period of twenty-five (25) days after the
written notice of breach and such breach would result in a failure to satisfy
a condition to the Buyers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10(a)(iii)_ shall not be available
to the Buyer if, at such time, the Buyer is in breach of any representation
or warranty set forth in _Section 3(b)_ or any covenant contained in this
Agreement and such breach would result in a failure to satisfy a condition to
the Sellers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

(iv) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Buyer at any time before the Closing in the event the Buyer has materially
breached any representation or warranties set forth in  _Section 3(b)_ or
any covenant contained in this Agreement, the Seller has notified the Buyer
of the breach, the breach is not curable, or, if curable, has continued
without cure for a period of twenty-five (25) days after the written notice
of breach and such breach would result in a failure to satisfy a condition to
the Sellers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10(a)(iv)_ shall not be available to the Seller if, at such time, the Seller
is in breach of any representation or warranties set forth in _Section 3(a)_
or _Section 4_ or any covenant contained in this Agreement and such breach
would result in a failure to satisfy a condition to the Buyers obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

(v) the Parties may terminate this Agreement if any Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or shall have taken any other
action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10(a)(v)_
shall have complied with _Section 5(a)_, _Section 5(b)_ and _Section 5(g)_
**,** it being agreed that the Parties shall promptly appeal any adverse
determination that is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); and

  



  

(vi) either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the other Party at any time before Closing if, prior to the time of such
notice, any of the Other Purchase Agreements had been duly terminated
pursuant to the provisions of such Other Purchase Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Effect of Termination_.  Except for the obligations under _Sections
5(f)(ii)(C)_ , _5(f)(ii)(G)_ ,  _8_ , _10_ and _11_ , if either Party
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10(a)_, all rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of
either Party to the other Party (except for any liability of either such
Party then in breach); _provided_ , that the provisions contained in 
_Sections 5(f)(ii)(C)_ , _5(f)(ii)(G)_ and _8(c)(iv)_ shall survive
termination.

  



  

11. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Confidentiality_. If the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall not be limited
by the terms thereof with respect to information, assets and operations of
the Acquired Companies. The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
not make disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information relating
to any Acquired Company to any Person other than (i) to its owners,
directors, officers, employees, consultants or other representatives to whom
such disclosure is necessary or convenient for the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) as required to convey title
to any of the Acquired Company Assets; (iii) as required by Law or any
securities exchange or market rule; (iv) as may be requested or required by
any Governmental Authority (provided that the Seller first notifies the Buyer
and gives the Buyer the opportunity to contest such request or requirement),
or (v) except with prior notice of such request for disclosure to, and
consent of, the Buyer (which consent may be withheld in the Buyers sole
discretion).

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

(b) _Public Announcements_.  Neither Party shall issue any press release or
make any public announcement or otherwise publicly disseminate information
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement before or after the Closing
without the prior written approval of the other Party (which approval will
not be withheld or delayed unreasonably); _provided_  that either Party may
make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by
applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly
traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party will advise the other
Party before making the disclosure and will provide the other Party, to the
extent practicable, with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed
disclosures).

  



  

(c) _Insurance_. To the extent the Seller has the Legal Right, (i) the Seller
shall cause any insurance policies covering the Acquired Company Assets
(except those stand-alone insurance policies that are in the name of any of
the Javelina Partnerships and that are obtained solely to cover the assets,
facilities and/or operations of the Javelina Partnerships (collectively, such
policies are the " ** _Javelina Insurance Policies_** ")) **** to remain in
full force and effect or to be renewed and maintained in full force and
effect through (but not after) the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller shall maintain the Acquired Companies (other than the
Javelina Partnerships) or the Acquired Company Assets (other than those of
the Javelina Partnerships) (as applicable) as divested entities or assets on
such insurance policies and any subsequent renewals thereof; (ii) the Seller
shall not take any action to release any insurer with respect to any claim
made under any such insurance policy before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller may release any such insurer (A) that is an
Affiliate of the Seller or (B) if such claim may be filed under a Javelina
Insurance Policy; and (iii) the Seller will file all insured claims (both
before and after Closing) that may be filed under any such insurance policy
for any Adverse Consequences occurring before Closing and will thereafter
coordinate with the Buyer to resolve all such claims after Closing;
_provided_ , _however,_ that (x) the Seller will not be required to file such
claims to the extent (A) the insurer of such claims is an Affiliate of the
Seller or (B) that such claims may be filed under a Javelina Insurance Policy
and (y) neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated or
otherwise liable for any deductible, self insured retention amount or
reimbursable amount payable by any of them with respect to any such claim.
The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, any insurance
policies maintained by the Seller and its Affiliates (including the
applicable Acquired Companies) and the Javelina Partnerships shall be
terminated or modified to exclude coverage of all or any portion of the
assets, facilities and/or operations of the Acquired Companies (except for
the Javelina Insurance Policies), and, as a result, the Buyer shall be
obligated at or before Closing to obtain at its sole cost and expense
replacement insurance, including insurance required by any Person to be
maintained for or by the Acquired Companies. The Buyer further acknowledges
and agrees that the Buyer may need to provide to certain Governmental
Authorities and other Persons evidence of such replacement or substitute
insurance coverage for the continued operations or businesses of the Acquired
Companies.

  



  

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.  Except for the indemnification
provisions, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

(e) _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

Neither Party may assign, alienate, delegate or otherwise transfer all or any
portion of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written approval of the other Party (which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld); _provided_ ,  _however_ , without the prior approval
of the Seller, the Buyer and its permitted successors and assigns
may transfer any or all of its rights or interests under this Agreement to a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer for so long as such Person remains a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, including designating one or more such
Persons to be the assignee of some or any portion of the Acquired Company
Equity Interests; _and_ _provided_   _further_ that no transfer shall result
in the release of the requesting Party from any of its obligations under this
Agreement, and such Party shall remain a primary obligor (as opposed to
a surety) thereof.

  



  

(f) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original but which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

  



  

(g) _Headings_. The Section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

such occurrence. All waivers must be in writing.

  



  

(k) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

(m) _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement.  Any reference to any federal, state,
local, or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation. All

, _Schedules_ , Articles, Sections or subdivisions thereof shall refer to

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

the corresponding _Exhibits_ , _Schedules_ , Article, Section or subdivision
thereof of this Agreement unless specific reference is made to such exhibits,
articles, sections or subdivisions of another document or instrument. The
terms "herein," "hereby," "hereunder," "hereof," "hereinafter," and other
equivalent words refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not solely to
the particular portion of the Agreement in which such word is used.

  



  

(n) _Exhibits and Schedules_.

  



  

(i) The _Exhibits_ and _Schedules_  identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any fact or item
which is disclosed in any part of the Transaction Agreements (including any
schedule, exhibit or other attachment thereto) will be deemed to have been
disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement (if reasonably apparent that
such disclosure relates to another portion of the Agreement) **, **
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto.

  



  

(ii) Matters reflected in the _Exhibits_ and _Schedules_  are not necessarily
limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected therein. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. In no event shall the
listing of such matters therein be deemed or interpreted to broaden or
otherwise amplify the applicable Partys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The fact that any item of

or (iv) be used as a basis for interpreting the term "material" or

and the _Exhibits_ and _Schedules_ , the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that (A) nothing contained in any of the _Exhibits_ and _Schedules_
 shall constitute a representation, warranty or other assurance (x) as to
the quality, condition or capability of any of the facilities, components or
other assets contained therein or (y) as to the ownership interest of the
Seller or any other Person as to any such asset and (B) with respect to
such matters, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, meaning that the
Buyer is exclusively relying on its own due diligence and independent
investigation, as contemplated by _Section 3(b)(v)_ and the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. Except
as set forth in this Agreement, the Seller hereby disclaims any and all
representations, warranties or other assurances with respect to any and all
such assets, as contemplated by _Sections 8(b)(x)_ and _8(h)_.
