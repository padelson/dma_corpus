into the Company, whereby it is contemplated that each outstanding share of
Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into one share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and each outstanding share of the Common Stock will
be converted into cash as provided in this Agreement. On and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company, which shall continue to be governed
by the Laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Merger shall be pursuant to the provisions of, and
shall be with the effect provided in, the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
_DGCL_ ").

 

 _2.2_

 

 _The Closing_. The Closing shall take place on the third Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
conditions with respect to actions the Parties will take at the Closing
itself), but in no event later than October 31, 2005, or such other time and
date as the Parties may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

 _2.3_

 

 _Actions at Closing_. At the Closing, (i) the Company will deliver to Parent
and Merger Sub the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to
in Article VI of this Agreement, (ii) Parent and Merger Sub will deliver to
the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in
Article VII of this Agreement, (iii) the Certificate of Merger shall be
executed and acknowledged by each of Merger Sub and the Company and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and (iv) Parent will cause
Merger Sub to deliver the Merger Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7(b)
hereof) to the Company Stockholders.

 

 _2.4_

 

 _Effect of Merger_.

 

(a)

 

 _General_. The Merger shall become effective at the Effective Time. The
Merger shall have the effect set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, the identity, existence, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties and assets of the Company shall continue unaffected and
unimpaired by the Merger; the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Surviving Corporation shall become the owner, without transfer,
of all rights and property of the Constituent Corporations; and the Surviving
Corporation shall be subject to all of the debts and liabilities of the
Constituent Corporations as if the Surviving Corporation had itself incurred
them. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time,
take any action (including executing and delivering any document) in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub in order to carry out and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. The Certificate of Incorporation and
the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with their respective terms
and as provided by applicable Law.

 

(c)

 

 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Merger Sub shall
become the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation at and as of
the Effective Time (retaining their respective positions and terms of office).

 

 _2.5_

 

 _Conversion of Stock; Procedure for Payment_.

 

(a)

 

 _Common Stock of the Company_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Stock,
the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting
Shares, and (ii) those shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)) shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the
right to receive in cash an amount equal to (i) the Common Stock Price, plus
(ii) the right to receive the Per Share Escrow Amount, if any, when
distributed, plus (iii) the Per Share Cash and Working Capital Excess, if any,
and less any applicable withholding of taxes (such amount hereinafter referred
to as the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). All such Common Stock, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any
such Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the consideration specified in the preceding sentence. 

 

(b)

 

 _Cancellation of Certain Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common
Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Common Stock that is owned by
the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary as treasury stock or otherwise or
owned by Merger Sub shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

 

(c)

 

 _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of Merger Sub Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ "). Each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the
necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the shares of the
Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such shares have been converted
pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder
thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate
representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock formerly represented thereby shall have been
converted pursuant to the terms hereof.

 

(d)

 

 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who
timely delivers to the Company such holders notice of intent to demand
payment for such holders shares if the Merger is effected, thereafter does
not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who
otherwise properly demands appraisal for such Common Stock in accordance with
the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance
with Section 2.5(a) hereof, but shall represent and become the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or never had or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise never
had or loses such holders right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares
held by such holder shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into a right to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the
Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5(a). The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and
Merger Sub shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, except with the
prior written consent of Merger Sub, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

 _2.6_

 

 _Warrants; Options; Stock Plans_. 

 

(a)

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each outstanding
unexercised option to purchase Common Stock, whether or not then vested or
fully exercisable, granted on or prior to the date hereof to any current or
former employee or director of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other
person, whether under any stock option plan or otherwise (including, without
limitation, under the Alabama Metal Industries Corporation 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Stock Plan_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Warrant_ " means each outstanding unexercised warrant
to purchase Common Stock granted on or prior to the date hereof.

 

(b)

 

The Company shall take all actions necessary so that (i) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each outstanding Option granted under the Stock Plan and
Warrant held by those holders of record listed in Section 3.2 of the
Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Options and Warrants" shall become
immediately vested and exercisable in full and (ii) at the Effective Time, all
Options and Warrants shall be canceled, in each case, in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plan or warrant agreement under which such
Options and Warrants were granted as applicable. In consideration of such
cancellation, each holder of an Option or Warrant canceled in accordance with
this Section 2.6 will be entitled to receive in settlement of such Option or
Warrant (i) immediately following the Effective Time, a cash payment, subject
to any required withholding of taxes, equal to the product of (A) the total
number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of such
Option or Warrant and (B) (I) the Common Stock Price less (II) the applicable
exercise price per share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of
such Option or Warrant, (ii) if and when distributed, an amount equal to the
product of (A) the sum of the Per Share Cash and Working Capital Excess, if
any, and (B) the total number of Shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable
upon exercise of such Option or Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (iii) if and when distributed, an amount equal to the product of (A)
the Per Share Escrow Amount and (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Option or Warrant immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(c)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if
appropriate, amending or waiving the terms of the relevant Stock Plan or
agreements providing for vesting conditions on Common Stock, Warrants or
Options therefor) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.6.

 

(d)

 

Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to in writing by Merger Sub and
the Company, the Stock Plan shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time
and no participant in the Stock Plan shall thereafter be granted any rights
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or any subsidiary of any of the foregoing. 

 

 _2.7_

 

 _Payments_.

 

(a)

 

 _Deposit with Escrow Agent_. At Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall deposit
with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Escrow Deposit, to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 8.2
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Deposit shall not
constitute part of the consideration received by the Company Securityholders
in respect of their Common Stock unless and until received by the Common
Securityholders, and until so received shall be deemed to be consideration
that is contingent. 

 

(b)

 

 _Payment for Shares_. 

 

(i)

 

Upon surrender to the Surviving Corporation by each Company Stockholder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares or Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)), the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to promptly
receive in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate
and (ii) the Common Stock Price, which amounts shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation by check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions
provided by such holder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on
the consideration payable upon the surrender of any certificate. If the
consideration provided for herein is to be delivered in the name of a person
other than the person in whose name the certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of such delivery that the certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of such delivery to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate, or that such person shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.7(b)(i), each certificate (other than certificates representing
Dissenting Shares or Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(b))
shall represent, for all purposes, in the case of certificates representing
Common Stock (other than Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.5(b)), only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(ii)

 

After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

 

(iii)

 

In the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record
owner of such certificate) claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(iv)

 

The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Company Securityholder pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
the Surviving Corporation, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(c)

 

 _Transaction Expenses; Repayment of Indebtedness_. From the date hereof
through the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to utilize any and all
available cash of the Company (i) to pay the Transaction Expenses and (ii) to
repay outstanding indebtedness (including accrued interest thereon and any
prepayment penalties) owed by the Company for borrowed money, including
amounts owed on capitalized leases (the " _Indebtedness for Borrowed Money_
"). On the second Business Day prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to
the Buying Group a schedule setting forth all unpaid Transaction Expenses and
unpaid Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, and at Closing, the Company shall pay,
as a portion of the Merger Price, all then unpaid Transaction Expenses and all
then unpaid Indebtedness for Borrowed Money. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company with the funds necessary to make such payments.

 

 _2.8_

 

 _Post-Closing Merger Price Adjustment_. The Merger Price shall be subject to
adjustment after the Closing in accordance with the following procedure:

 

(a)

 

Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Parent will prepare and
deliver (i) a proposed balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date but
prior to the consummation of the transactions provided for herein (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a schedule showing the amount of the
Acquired Working Capital, the Closing Date Excess Cash Amount and any
adjustments to the Merger Price to be made pursuant to Section 2.8(f) or
2.8(g) (the " _Closing Schedule_ ") to the Stockholder Representative. The
proposed Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Interim Financial
Statements.

 

(b)

 

The proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule shall be final and
binding on the parties unless, within thirty (30) days after the Stockholder
Representatives receipt of the proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Schedule, the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered to the Parent a
detailed statement describing all of his objections to the proposed Closing
Balance Sheet or Closing Schedule. The Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections. If final resolution is not obtained within fifteen (15) days
after the Parent has received such statement of objections, each of the Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall refer the matters in dispute to the
Independent Accountants for arbitration. Promptly following such referral,
the Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall mutually agree upon the
procedures to be followed by the Independent Accountants in resolving such
disputes. Following such referral, no further disputes or disagreements with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Schedule may be raised by the
Parent or the Stockholder Representative with Independent Accountants. The
Independent Accountants shall decide all of such matters in dispute, and their
determinations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parent and the
Stockholder Representative with respect to the matters in dispute.

 

(c)

 

The Parent will revise the proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule
as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the objections of the Stockholder
Representative (as agreed by the parties or as directed by the Independent
Accountants) and deliver it to the Stockholder Representative within twenty
(20) days after the final resolution of such objections. Such revised
statement (or, if no objections are made or no revisions are required, the
proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule) shall constitute the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule.

 

(d)

 

If any unresolved objections are submitted to the Independent Accountants for
resolution as provided above, the fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne equally, one-half (1/2) by the Parent and one-half
(1/2) shall be paid from the Escrow Deposit.

 

(e)

 

The Parent will make the work papers and other information used in preparing
the proposed Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule available to the
Stockholder Representative at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. 

 

(f)

 

If the Acquired Working Capital reflected in the Closing Schedule, as finally
determined, is less than the Established Working Capital by more than One
Million and 00/100 Dollars (the " _Minimum Adjustment Amount_ "), the Merger
Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by such difference to the
extent that such difference exceeds the Minimum Adjustment Amount. If the
Closing Date Excess Cash Amount reflected in the Closing Schedule, as finally
determined, is less than the Estimated Excess Cash Amount, the Merger Price
shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The amount of any reduction in
the Merger Price shall be paid from the Escrow Deposit to the Parent within
ten (10) days following the determination of the amount thereof, by wire
transfer of same day funds credited to the account of the Parent as provided
by the Parent to the Escrow Agent in writing. Any payment pursuant to this
Section 2.8(f) shall be accompanied by accrued interest from the Closing Date
to the date of payment at an annual rate of interest equal to the prime rate
of interest as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ from time to time from
the Closing Date to the date of such payment.

 

(g)

 

If the Acquired Working Capital reflected in the Closing Schedule, as finally
determined, exceeds the Established Working Capital by more than the Minimum
Adjustment Amount, the Merger Price shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by such difference to the extent that such difference exceeds the
Minimum Adjustment Amount. If the Closing Date Excess Cash Amount reflected
in the Closing Schedule, as finally determined, exceeds the Estimated Excess
Cash Amount, the Merger Price shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by such difference. The amount of any increase in the Merger Price shall be
paid by the Parent to the Stockholder Representative, for distribution to the
Company Securityholders as hereinafter provided, within ten (10) days
following the determination of the amount thereof, by wire transfer of same
day funds. Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.8(g) shall be accompanied
by accrued interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at an annual
rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the _Wall
Street Journal_ from time to time from the Closing Date to the date of such
payment.

 

(h)

 

Upon receipt of any payments as provided in subparagraph (g) above, the
Stockholder Representative shall distribute to the Company Securityholders
their respective portion of such payments based on the percentages set forth
opposite each Company Securityholders name on Section 3.2 of the Disclosure
Schedule. Upon payment by the Company of any amounts due to the Company
Securityholders under this Section 2.8 to the Stockholder Representative, the
Company shall have no further liability to the Company Securityholders for the
payment of such amounts. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer to the
account which the Company Securityholder has designated in writing to the
Stockholder Representative.

 

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

All representations and warranties of the Company are made subject to the
exceptions that are noted on the Disclosure Schedule, as supplemented from
time to time by the Company hereafter and prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to the foregoing, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 _3.1_

 

 _Organization and Authority_.

 

(a)

 

The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists
all subsidiaries of the Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a
corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation which is set forth in Section 3.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule, except where the failure to be so validly existing and in
active status would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Subsidiary is duly qualified to conduct business as a foreign corporation, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the
properties owned or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such
qualification necessary except where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Any states or other jurisdictions other than
Delaware in which the Company or any Subsidiary is qualified to do business
are listed in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b)

 

The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on the
Business as and where such is now being conducted.

 

 _3.2_

 

 _Capitalization_.

 

(a)

 

Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) the authorized capital
stock of the Company and the name and authorized capital stock of each of the
Subsidiaries; (ii) the names of the Company Stockholders; (iii) the number of
shares of capital stock of the Company owned by each Company Stockholder; and
(iv) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
outstanding Options and Warrants (both vested and unvested). All of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly
issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable. Except as otherwise described
in Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, the outstanding shares of Common
Stock are owned by the Company Stockholders free and clear of all Liens.
Except for this Agreement and as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, no
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interest in, the Company are
reserved for issuance and there are no outstanding Options, Warrants, rights,
conversion rights, or rights of first refusal or offer, subscriptions, claims
of any character, agreements or understandings relating to the capital stock
of the Company pursuant to which the Company is or may become obligated to
issue or exchange any shares of its capital stock or any person has any right
to acquire an interest in any capital stock of the Company. Section 3.2 of
the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the holders of record of all outstanding
Options granted under the Stock Plan and unexercised Warrants issued by the
Company. To the Companys Knowledge, none of the Common Stock is subject to
any voting trust, proxy or other contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment
or understanding relating thereto.

 

(b)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of each
Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens. Except for this Agreement and as set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule, no shares of capital stock of, or other
ownership interest in, any Subsidiary are reserved for issuance and there are
no outstanding options, warrants, rights, conversion rights, or rights of
first refusal or offer, subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements or
understandings relating to the capital stock of any Subsidiary pursuant to
which the Subsidiary is or may become obligated to issue or exchange any
shares of its capital stock or any person has any right to acquire an interest
in any capital stock of the Subsidiary.

 

(c)

 

The Company (i) does not have any subsidiaries except the Subsidiaries set
forth in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) does not directly or
indirectly, own or hold the right to acquire any shares of stock or any other
security or interest in any other Person and (iii) is not subject to any
obligation to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of loans,
capital contributions or otherwise) to or in any Person.

 

 _3.3_

 

 _Authority; Validity_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by the Company
pursuant hereto and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by the Company
Stockholders and the Board of Directors of the Company. No act or proceeding
on the part of the Company or the Company Stockholders is necessary to
authorize this Agreement or the other documents and instruments to be executed
and delivered by the Company pursuant hereto or the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
constitutes, and when executed and delivered, the other documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered by the Company pursuant hereto will
constitute, valid and binding agreements of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except as such may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting
creditors rights generally, and by general equitable principles.

 

 _3.4_

 

 _No Violation_. Except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both (a) cause
a breach or violation of or default under any provision of (i) its Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws; (ii) any Material Contract to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary may be
bound; (iii) any decree, order, injunction or other decision of any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
subject and except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for those breaches,
violations or defaults that would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect; or (b) result in the creation of any Lien upon the
Common Stock or the assets of the Company.

 

 _3.5_

 

 _Governmental Party Consents_. Except for the expiration of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, no approval, authorization, notice, consent
or other action by or filing with any Governmental Authority is required for
the Companys execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _3.6_

 

 _Financial Statements_. Section 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedule contains
complete and accurate copies of the Financial Statements. All of such
Financial Statements (a) have been prepared in accordance with the Books and
Records regularly maintained by the Company, (b) fairly present the financial
condition and results of operations of the Company, (c) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP, subject, in the case of the Interim Financial
Statements, to normal year-end and audit adjustments and any other adjustments
described therein and to the absence of footnotes thereto and (d) have been
prepared using a FIFO basis for Inventory accounting in the case of the
Interim Financial Statements and using a LIFO basis for Inventory accounting
in the case of the Annual Financial Statements. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liabilities that are not fully and adequately accrued or
reserved against in accordance with GAAP, other than liabilities incurred in
the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the Interim Financial
Statements, none of which, either individually or in the aggregate, are

Company Securityholders on any matters concerning this Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to seek such further
authorization from the Company Securityholders prior to acting on their
behalf. In such event, each Company Securityholder shall have a number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock (or shares of Common Stock

the Stockholder Representative shall require the act of a majority of the

notice delivered to the other Stockholder Representative, if any, and to
Parent. If there is a vacancy at any time in any of the positions of

Securityholder on the Closing Date and the authorization of a majority of such
number of such shares shall be binding on all of the Company Securityholders
and shall constitute authorization by the Company Securityholders.

 

(e)

understands this Agreement, hereby accepts such appointment and designation,
and represents that he will act in his capacity as a Stockholder
Representative in strict compliance with and conformance to the provisions of

connection with this Agreement, except for his own bad faith or willful
misconduct or gross negligence. The Stockholder Representative may seek the
advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the
construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or his duties
hereunder, and he shall incur no liability to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
Securityholder or the Escrow Agent and shall be fully protected with respect
to any action taken, omitted or suffered by him in good faith in accordance
with the opinion of such counsel.

the performance of his duties under this Agreement (including any fees and

retain all Books and Records relating to the Companys pre-closing Tax,
accounting or legal matters for a period of at least six (6) years from the

any such document or record may be disposed of by the Buying Group if the
Buying Group first offers to surrender possession thereof to the Company
Stockholders at their expense and the Stockholder Representative either waives
such right of possession or fails to respond to such request after thirty (30)
days after notice from the Company. The Company Stockholders shall have the
right during business hours, upon reasonable notice to Parent, to inspect and
make copies of any such records for any reasonable purpose.

the aggregate in excess of Two Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars
($2,400,000), sale of shares of capital stock (other than pursuant to the
exercise of Options or Warrants) or similar transactions involving the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company or any divisions thereof (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 5.10

Company) information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
businesses, properties and assets after execution of a customary
confidentiality agreement, (b) engaging in discussions or negotiations with a
Third Party who (without any violation of this Section 5.10 by the Company)
has made a written Acquisition Proposal or a written proposal that is
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and (c) following the

the Offer and the Merger (as determined in each case in good faith by the
Board of Directors after consultation with the Companys financial advisor) (a
" _Superior Proposal_ ") terminating this Agreement by sending written notice
to the Parent and Merger Sub, but in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (a) through (c) only to the extent that the Board of Directors shall
conclude in good faith upon advice of outside legal counsel that such action
is necessary in order for the Board of Directors to act in a manner that is
consistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Third Party_ " shall mean any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, association, person or other entity or "group" (as
defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) other than Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliates of Parent or Merger
Sub and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and
agents. The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Party
conducted heretofore with respect to any Third Party Acquisition Proposal
existing on the date hereof. As long as this Agreement remains in effect, the
Company will promptly communicate in writing to Parent and Merger Sub the
existence of any Third Party Acquisition Proposal received after the execution
hereof. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this
Section, the Company shall pay to the Parent a termination fee in the amount

in connection with any claim for indemnification hereunder with respect to

 _8.4_

 

 _Procedures for Indemnification_.

 

(a)

 

If an Indemnified Party shall claim to have suffered a Loss (other than with
respect to a Third Party Claim) for which indemnification is available under
Section 8.2 or 8.3, as the case may be (for purposes of this Section 8.4,
regardless of whether such Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a payment
in respect of such claim by virtue of paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) of Section
8.2), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such claim within the time periods provided in paragraph (b)(ii) of Section
8.2 or paragraph (b) of Section 8.3, as the case may be, or as to a claim
under Sections 8.2(a)(ii) or 8.3(a)(ii) at any time after the Closing Date,
which written notice shall describe the nature of such claim, the facts and
circumstances that give rise to such claim and the amount of such claim if
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made (or if not then
reasonably ascertainable, the maximum amount of such claim reasonably
estimated by the Indemnified Party). In the case of a claim by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, a copy of such written notice shall also be provided by
the Indemnified Party to the Escrow Agent. In the event that within thirty
(30) days after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such a written notice
from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall not have received from
the Indemnifying Party a written objection to such claim, such claim shall be
conclusively presumed and considered to have been assented to and approved by
the Indemnifying Party following receipt by the Indemnifying Party (and, in
the case of a claim by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow
Agent) of a written notice from the Indemnified Party to such effect.

 

(b)

 

If within the thirty (30) day period described in paragraph (a) above the
Indemnified Party (and, in the case of claim by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the Escrow Agent) shall have received from the Indemnifying Party
a written notice setting forth the Indemnifying Partys objections to such
claim and the Indemnifying Partys reasons for such objection, then the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of ten (10) Business Days
from the date the Indemnified Party receives such objection (such period is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Negotiation Period_ "). After the
Negotiation Period, if the Parties still cannot agree on the claim, the
Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 8.7 below with
respect to the resolution of such matter.

 

 _8.5_

 

 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a)

 

Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII in
respect of any Third-Party Claim shall give the Indemnifying Party from whom
indemnification with respect to such claim is sought (i) prompt written notice
(but in no event more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party acquires
knowledge thereof) of such Third-Party Claim and (ii) copies of all documents
and information relating to any such Third-Party Claim within ten (10) days of
their being obtained by the Indemnified Party; provided, that the failure by
the Indemnified Party to so notify or provide copies to the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified
Party for any liability hereunder except to the extent that such failure shall
have prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(b)

 

The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser time as may
be necessary to comply with statutory response requirements for litigation
claims that are included in any Third-Party Claim) from receipt of the notice
contemplated in Section 8.5(a) to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not
the Indemnifying Party will, at its sole cost and expense, defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim. If the Indemnifying Party timely gives
notice that it intends to defend the Third-Party Claim, it shall have the
right, except as hereafter provided, to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with the Third-Party Claim and to be represented by counsel of
its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with
respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the same without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, so long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting or
defending the same with reasonable diligence and in good faith; provided, that
the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense; provided further, that the Indemnifying Party may
not enter into a settlement of any such Third-Party Claim without the consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall be not unreasonably withheld,
unless such settlement requires no more than a monetary payment for which the
Indemnified Party is fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or involves
other matters not binding upon the Indemnified Party; and provided further
that, in the event the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to accept
the defense of, and assume all responsibility for, such Third-Party Claim as
provided above in this Section 8.5(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the
Third-Party Claim in such manner as the Indemnified Party deems appropriate,
in its sole discretion, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification therefor from the Indemnifying Party to the extent provided
under this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Party such Third-Party Claim, or the litigation or
resolution of such Third-Party Claim, involves an issue or matter that could
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Indemnified Party, including the
administration of Tax Returns of the Indemnified Party or a dispute with a
significant supplier or customer of the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict
of interest in the defense of such action between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control
the defense or settlement of any such claim or demand and its reasonable costs
and expenses shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party elects to exercise such
right, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of such claim at its sole cost and expense.

 

 _8.6_

 

 _Effect of Indemnification_. Any indemnity payment made hereunder shall be
treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Merger Price.

 

 _8.7_

 

 _Arbitration_. All disputes arising under this Article VIII shall be
resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be by a single
arbitrator experienced in the matters at issue and selected by the parties
hereto in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be held in such place in
Atlanta, Georgia as may be specified by the arbitrator (or any place agreed to
by the parties hereto and the arbitrator). The decision of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding as to any matters submitted under this Article VIII
provided, however, if necessary, such decision and satisfaction procedure may
be enforced by any Party in any court of record having jurisdiction over the
subject matter or over any of the parties to this Agreement. All costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding
(including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be borne by the Party against
which the decision is rendered, or, if no decision is rendered, such costs and
expenses shall be borne equally by the Indemnifying Party as one party and the
Indemnified Party as the other party. If the arbitrators decision is a
compromise, the determination of which Party or Parties bears the costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding shall be
made by the arbitrator on the basis of the arbitrators assessment of the
relative merits of the Parties positions.

 

 _8.8_

 

 _Insurance_. In the event an Indemnified Party actually receives any
insurance proceeds with respect to damages for which the Indemnified Party has
made a claim prior to the date on which the Indemnifying Party is required
pursuant to this Article VIII to pay such claim, the claim shall be reduced by
an amount equal to such insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party
less all costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance
proceeds. If such insurance proceeds are actually received by the Indemnified
Party after the date on which the Indemnifying Party is required pursuant to
this Article VIII to pay such claim, the Indemnified Party shall, no later
than thirty (30) days after the receipt of such insurance proceeds, reimburse
the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal to such insurance proceeds (but in
no event in an amount greater than the damages theretofore paid to the
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party) less all reasonable costs
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds. The
Indemnified Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
recovery of any insurance proceeds that may be available, provided however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to delay any payment beyond
the respective payment dates for any claim referred to in this Article VIII
for the purpose of awaiting receipt of insurance proceeds or credits therefor
as provided herein. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII, the
Indemnifying Party shall, upon payment of such indemnity in full, be
subrogated to, and the Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying
Party, all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter to which such indemnification relates, including all rights under any
insurance policy relating to such matter.

 

 _8.9_

 

 _Company Securityholder Liability for Action of Other Company
Securityholders_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall any Company Securityholder have any responsibility or liability
for any Losses to the extent such Losses arise or result from (a) any
misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company concerning another Company Securityholder or (b) any breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of another Company Securityholder contained
in this Agreement.
