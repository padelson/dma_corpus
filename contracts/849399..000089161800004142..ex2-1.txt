3.27    v  7   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of July 26, 2000 by
and among Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Symantec"), Apache
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Symantec ("Merger Sub"), and AXENT Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("AXENT"), with respect to the following facts:   A. The respective boards
of directors of Symantec, Merger Sub and  AXENT have approved and declared
advisable the merger of Merger Sub with  and into AXENT (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions  set forth herein, and have
determined that the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fair to, and in the best  interests of, their respective
stockholders.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the
outstanding shares  of AXENT Common Stock, $0.02 par value ("AXENT Common
Stock"), will be  converted into the right to receive shares of Symantec
Common Stock, $0.01  par value ("Symantec Common Stock"), at the rate set
forth herein.   C. For United States federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that  the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section  368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").   D. For financial accounting purposes, it is intended
that the Merger  will be accounted for under the purchase method.   The
parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Delaware Law"), (i) Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into AXENT, (ii) the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and (iii) AXENT shall be the surviving corporation.
AXENT, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   1.2 Closing;
Effective Time. The closing of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Closing") will take place at 8:00 a.m., local time,
on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall be
no later than the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII, unless another time or date
is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at the
offices of Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe LLP, 525 University Avenue, Palo
Alto, California, or at such other location as the parties hereto shall
mutually agree. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing a certificate of merger substantially in the form
of Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law
(the time of such filing, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by
the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective
Time").   1.3 Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective
Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of AXENT and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of AXENT and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) Subject to Section 5.8, from and after the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended in its entirety to read substantially as set forth in
Exhibit B attached hereto.  8   (b) Subject to Section 5.8, from and after
the Effective Time the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.  
1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors
and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
serve as the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SHARES   2.1 Conversion of
Stock. Pursuant to the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock or securities of AXENT or
Merger Sub:   (a) As of the Effective Time, each share of AXENT Common Stock
issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares  of AXENT Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(c))
shall be  automatically converted into 0.50 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a fully
paid  and nonassessable share of Symantec Common Stock.   (b) As of the
Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or  certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  outstanding shares of
AXENT Common Stock shall cease to have any rights  with respect thereto,
except the right to receive (i) a certificate (or, at  the Holder\'s request,
direct registration) representing the number of whole  shares of Symantec
Common Stock into which such shares have been converted  (the "Symantec
Certificates"), and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares  of Symantec
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(f), without  interest.   (c) As
of the Effective Time, each share of AXENT Common Stock held of  record
immediately prior to the Effective Time by AXENT, Merger Sub,  Symantec or
any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.1(g)) of Symantec shall  be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (d) As of the Effective
Time, each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par  value, of Merger Sub (the
"Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, extinguished and  automatically converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable share of Common Stock,
$0.001 par value, of the Surviving  Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of a number of shares of  Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed
to evidence ownership of the same  number of shares of Common Stock, $0.001,
of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Without limiting any other provision of
this Agreement, the  Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock  split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or  distribution of securities convertible into Symantec Common
Stock or AXENT  Common Stock), extraordinary dividend or distribution,
reorganization,  reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to  Symantec Common Stock or AXENT Common Stock occurring or having a
record  date or an effective date on or after the date hereof and prior to
the  Effective Time.   (f) No fraction of a share of Symantec Common Stock
will be issued by  virtue of the Merger. Instead, each holder of shares of
AXENT Common Stock  who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Symantec Common  Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Symantec Common Stock to  be received by such holder) shall receive from
Symantec an amount of cash  (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the product of (i) such  fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Symantec Closing
Value. For the purposes  of this Agreement, "Symantec Closing Value" shall
mean the closing price  per share of Symantec Common Stock as reported on the
Nasdaq National  Market System ("Nasdaq") on the trading day immediately
preceding the  Effective Time.   (g) For the purposes of this Agreement,
the "Exchange Multiple" of any  quantity means the product obtained from
multiplying such quantity by the  Exchange Ratio, and the "Exchange Quotient"
of any quantity means the  quotient obtained from dividing such quantity by
the Exchange Ratio. For  purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term
"Subsidiary", when used with  respect to any Person, means any   2  9  
corporation, entity or other organization, whether incorporated or 
unincorporated, of which (A) at least a majority of the securities or other 
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority  of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with  respect
to such corporation, entity or other organization is directly or  indirectly
owned or controlled by such Person (through ownership of  securities, by
contract or otherwise) or (B) such Person or any Subsidiary  of such Person
is a general partner of any general partnership or a manager  of any limited
liability company. For the purposes of this Agreement, the  term "Person"
means any individual, group, organization, corporation,  partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company, trust or entity of  any kind.   2.2
AXENT Options; AXENT Purchase Plan.   (a) As of the Effective Time, Symantec
shall assume all of the stock options of AXENT, whether or not vested or
immediately exercisable, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the AXENT Stock Plans (as defined below) (the "AXENT Options"). For
purposes of this Agreement, "AXENT Stock Plans" means the plans listed on
Schedule 2.2(a). Each AXENT Option, whether or not exercisable at the
Effective Time, shall be assumed by Symantec in such a manner that it shall
be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the AXENT Stock
Plan pursuant to which it was granted and the applicable option agreement
issued thereunder; provided that (i) each such option thereafter shall be
exercisable for a number of shares of Symantec Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of
shares of AXENT Common Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the option
price per share of Symantec Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange
Quotient of the option price per share of AXENT Common Stock subject to such
option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Symantec
Exchange Options"); provided that if the Exchange Quotient results in an
aggregate exercise price that requires the payment of a fraction of a cent at
the time of exercise of Symantec Exchange Options for one or more shares of
Symantec Common Stock (with the exercise price considered in the aggregate
for all such options being exercised), then the aggregate exercise price for
such shares shall be further adjusted upwards to the nearest whole cent.  
(b) AXENT shall amend the AXENT Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"AXENT Purchase Plan") so that as of the Effective Time: (i) the AXENT
Purchase Plan shall provide that no additional purchase rights shall be
issued under it; (ii) each purchase right granted under the AXENT Purchase
Plan shall terminate, if it has not previously terminated by its terms, on
the date that the holder thereof enrolls in the Symantec 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "Symantec Purchase Plan"); provided that if the purchase
date under the AXENT Purchase Plan coincides with the enrollment date under
the Symantec Purchase Plan, the purchase rights under the AXENT Purchase Plan
shall not terminate prior to the purchase on such date; and (iii) make such
other modifications to the AXENT Purchase Plan so as to permit the
implementation of this Section 2.2(b). As of the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding purchase right granted under the AXENT Purchase Plan shall be
assumed by Symantec in such a manner that it shall be exercisable upon the
same terms and conditions (as amended as described above) as under the AXENT
Purchase Plan immediately before the Effective Time; provided that each such
purchase right shall thereafter be exercisable for whole shares of Symantec
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange
Multiple of the number of shares of AXENT Common Stock for which
such purchase right would otherwise have been exercisable determined as of
the relevant grant date under the AXENT Purchase Plan at a purchase price per
share equal to 85% of the lower of: (i) the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) of the fair market value of a share of AXENT Common
Stock on the relevant grant date under the AXENT Purchase Plan or (ii) the
fair market value of a share of a Symantec Common Stock on the relevant
purchase date.   2.3 Exchange of Stock Certificates.   (a) At or prior to
the Effective Time, Symantec shall enter into an agreement with a bank or
trust company selected by Symantec and reasonably acceptable to AXENT to act
as the exchange agent for the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").   (b) At or
prior to the Effective Time, Symantec shall supply or cause to be supplied to
or for the account of the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the
holders of AXENT Common Stock, for exchange   3  10  pursuant to this
Section 2.3 (i) certificates (or, at the Holder\'s request, direct
registration) evidencing the shares of Symantec Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 to be exchanged for outstanding shares of
AXENT Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make
the payments in lieu of fractional shares provided for in Section 2.1(f).  
(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Symantec shall mail or shall cause to
be mailed to each Holder a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the AXENT Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
AXENT Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for surrender of
the AXENT Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an AXENT
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the
Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (i) certificates
evidencing that number of shares of Symantec Common Stock issuable to such
Holder in accordance with this Article II; (ii) any dividends or other
distributions that such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.3(d); and (iii) cash in respect of fractional shares as provided in Section
2.1(f), and such AXENT Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No certificate representing shares of Symantec Common Stock will be
issued to a Person who is not the registered owner of a surrendered AXENT
Certificate unless (i) the AXENT Certificate so surrendered has been properly
endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer, and (ii) such Person
shall either (A) pay any transfer or other tax required by reason of such
issuance or (B) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3, from and
after the Effective Time, each AXENT Certificate shall be deemed to
represent, for all purposes other than payment of dividends, the right
to receive a certificate representing the number of full shares of Symantec
Common Stock as determined in accordance with this Article II and cash in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f). For purposes of this
Agreement, "AXENT Certificate" means a certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of AXENT Common Stock, and "Holder"
means a person who holds one or more AXENT Certificates as of the Effective
Time.   (d) No dividend or other distribution shall be paid or declared
with respect to Symantec Common Stock prior to the Effective Time. No
dividend or other distribution declared with respect to Symantec Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to Holders of
unsurrendered AXENT Certificates until such Holders surrender their AXENT
Certificates. Upon the surrender of such AXENT Certificates, there shall be
paid to such Holders, promptly after such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions, excluding interest, declared with a record date after
the Effective Time and not paid because of the failure to surrender AXENT
Certificates for exchange.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Exchange Agent, Symantec, the Surviving
Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of
AXENT Common Stock for shares of Symantec Common Stock or cash in lieu of
fractional shares delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   2.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event that any AXENT Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in respect of
such lost, stolen or destroyed AXENT Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the
shares of Symantec Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1
and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 2.1(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.3(d); provided, however, that Symantec may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed AXENT Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Symantec or the Exchange Agent with respect to the AXENT Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   2.5 Tax Consequences. For
United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended by the parties
hereto that this Agreement is a "plan of reorganization" and that the Merger
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   4  11   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
AXENT   AXENT makes to Symantec and Merger Sub the representations and
warranties contained in this Article III, in each case subject to the
exceptions set forth in the disclosure statement, dated as of the date hereof
(the "AXENT Disclosure Statement"). The AXENT Disclosure Statement shall be
arranged in schedules corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections of
this Article III, and the disclosure in any Schedule of the AXENT Disclosure
Statement shall only qualify the corresponding Section of this Article III,
unless the disclosure contained in such Section contains such information so
as to enable a reasonable person to determine that such disclosure qualifies
or otherwise applies to other Sections of this Article III.   3.1
Organization, Etc.   (a) Each of AXENT and its Subsidiaries is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of AXENT and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased properties or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an AXENT Material Adverse
Effect. For the purposes of this Agreement, "AXENT Material Adverse Effect"
means any change, event or effect that is materially adverse to the
consolidated business, results of operations or financial condition of AXENT
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that: (i) any
adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating to general business
or economic conditions which does not affect AXENT in a materially
disproportionate manner, shall not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, an "AXENT Material
Adverse Effect"; (ii) any adverse change, event or effect relating to or
affecting the software industry generally or the security software
industry generally, which does not affect AXENT in a materially
disproportionate manner, shall not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, an "AXENT Material
Adverse Effect"; and (iii) any adverse change, event or effect arising from
or relating to the announcement or pendency of the Merger, including, but not
limited to, changes or effects which result from the loss of customers or
delay, cancellation or cessation of orders for AXENT\'s products, shall not
be deemed to constitute, and shall not be taken into account in determining
whether there has been, an "AXENT Material Adverse Effect".   (b) Neither
AXENT nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other charter document. Schedule
3.1(b) of the AXENT Disclosure Statement sets forth (i) the full name of each
Subsidiary of AXENT, its capitalization and the ownership interest of AXENT
and each other Person (if any) therein, (ii) the jurisdiction in which each
such Subsidiary is organized, (iii) each jurisdiction in which AXENT and each
of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign Person, and (iv)
the names of the current directors and officers of AXENT and of each
Subsidiary of AXENT. AXENT has made available to Symantec accurate
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any
other charter documents, as currently in effect, of AXENT and each of
its Subsidiaries.   3.2 Authority Relative to This Agreement. AXENT has
full corporate power and authority to (i) execute and deliver this Agreement
and (ii) assuming the approval of the Merger by a majority of the outstanding
shares of AXENT Common Stock at the AXENT Special Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof in accordance with Delaware Law, consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly authorized by
the unanimous vote of the board of directors of AXENT, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of AXENT are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of the Merger by a
majority of the outstanding shares of AXENT Common Stock at the AXENT Special
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with the
Delaware Law and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of   5  12  the State of Delaware). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by AXENT and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Symantec and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of AXENT, enforceable against AXENT in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by general
equitable principles.   3.3 No Violations, Etc. No filing with or
notification to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
court, administrative agency, commission, or other governmental or regulatory
body, authority or instrumentality ("Government Entity") is necessary on the
part of AXENT for the consummation by AXENT of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or for the exercise by Symantec and the
Surviving Corporation of full rights to own and operate the business of AXENT
and its Subsidiaries as presently being conducted, except (i) for the filing
of the Certificate of Merger as required by Delaware Law, (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"),
state securities or "blue sky" laws and state takeover laws, and (iii) any
filing required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976 (the "HSR Act"). Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by AXENT with all of the provisions hereof and
thereof, nor the exercise by Symantec and the Surviving Corporation of full
rights to own and operate the business of AXENT and its Subsidiaries as
presently being conducted will, subject to obtaining the approval of the this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of AXENT
Common Stock at the AXENT Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof in
accordance with Delaware Law, (i) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
document of AXENT or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to AXENT or any of
its Subsidiaries, or by which any of their properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or result in
any change in, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which AXENT
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound, except in the case of clauses (ii) or
(iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults or other
occurrences that would not (x) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have an AXENT Material Adverse Effect, or (y) prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Schedule 3.3 of the AXENT Disclosure Statement lists all
consents, waivers and approvals required to be obtained in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under any of
AXENT\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures,
deeds of trust, licenses or leases, contracts, agreements or
other instruments or obligations the failure to obtain which would reasonably
be expected to have an AXENT Material Adverse Effect.   3.4 Board
Recommendation; State Takeover Statutes. The board of directors of AXENT has,
at a meeting of such board duly held on June 26, 2000, (i) approved and
adopted this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement is advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of AXENT,
(iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the stockholders of
AXENT, and (iv) resolved that AXENT take all action necessary to make

statutes or regulations including but not limited to Section 203 of the
Delaware Law.   3.5 Fairness Opinion. AXENT has received the opinion of

authorized capital stock of AXENT consists of 50,000,000 shares of AXENT
Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.02 par value ("AXENT

Purchase Plan, there are no warrants, options, convertible securities, calls,
rights, stock appreciation rights, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal, or agreements or commitments of any nature obligating AXENT
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of AXENT, or
obligating AXENT to grant, issue, extend, accelerate the vesting of, or enter
into, any such warrant, option, convertible security, call, right, stock
appreciation right, preemptive right, right of first refusal, agreement or
commitment. To the knowledge of AXENT, there are no voting trusts, proxies or
other agreements or understandings with respect to the capital stock of
AXENT. For purposes of this Agreement, "to the knowledge of AXENT," or words
of similar import, shall mean the actual knowledge of directors and executive
officers of AXENT and the persons set forth on Schedule 3.6(b).   (c) True
and complete copies of each AXENT Stock Plan and the AXENT Purchase Plan, and
of the forms of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under

instruments, and forms have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and
there are no agreements to amend, modify or supplement any such agreements,
instruments or forms.   (d) Schedule 3.6(d) of the AXENT Disclosure
Statement sets forth the following information with respect to each AXENT
Option: the aggregate number of shares issuable thereunder, the type of
option, the grant date, the expiration date, the exercise price and the
vesting schedule. Each AXENT Option was granted in accordance with the terms
of the AXENT Stock Plan applicable thereto. The terms of each of the AXENT
Stock Plans do not prohibit the assumption of the AXENT Options as provided
in Section 2.2(a). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6(d), consummation of
the Merger will not accelerate vesting of any AXENT Option.   3.7 SEC
Filings. AXENT has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") all required forms, reports, registration statements and documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC (collectively, all such
forms, reports, registration statements and documents filed since January 1,
1997 are referred to herein as the "AXENT SEC Reports"). All of the AXENT SEC
Reports complied as to form, when filed (or, if amended or superseded by
filing prior to the date hereof, then on the date of such filing), in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act") and the Exchange Act. Accurate and complete
copies of the AXENT SEC Reports have been made available to Symantec. The
AXENT SEC Reports (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein) did not, at the time they were filed (or,
if amended or superseded by filing prior to the date hereof, then on the date
of such filing), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. To the knowledge of AXENT, except as disclosed in the AXENT
SEC Reports, each of AXENT\'s officers and directors has complied with all
filing requirements under Section 13 and Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act.   3.8 Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in
the AXENT SEC Reports (the "AXENT Financial Statements"), (x) was prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act) and (y) fairly presented the consolidated financial position of AXENT
and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated,
consistent with the books and records of AXENT, except that the unaudited
interim financial   7  14  statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount. The balance sheet of AXENT contained in AXENT\'s Form
10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 (the "Reference Date") is

any other securities of AXENT or its Subsidiaries or any options, warrants,

respective officers and directors (in their capacities as such), or involving
any of their assets, before any court, governmental or regulatory authority
or body, or arbitration tribunal, except for those Actions which,
individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
an AXENT Material Adverse Effect. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of AXENT, threatened which in any manner challenges, seeks to, or
is reasonably likely to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) There is no outstanding
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, governmental or

reasonably be expected to cause such a breach, violation or default under),
any material agreement, contract or commitment to which AXENT or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or

AXENT Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Each AXENT Contract is a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of AXENT and to AXENT\'s knowledge, of the other

Material Adverse Effect and to the extent enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors\' rights governing or by general principles of
equity.   (d) An accurate and complete copy of each material AXENT Contract

There are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of AXENT or any of
its Subsidiaries, threatened, between   10  17  AXENT or any of its

AXENT and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and franchises from
governmental agencies required to conduct their businesses as now being

Rights.   (a) AXENT and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use
all intellectual property used to conduct their respective businesses
(such intellectual property and the rights thereto are collectively referred
to herein as the "AXENT IP Rights"). No royalties or other payments are
payable to any Person with respect to commercialization of any products
presently sold or under development by AXENT or its Subsidiaries.   (b) The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute a material breach of
any instrument or agreement governing any AXENT IP Rights, will not (i) cause
the modification of any terms of any licenses or agreements relating to any
AXENT IP Rights including but not limited to the modification of the
effective rate of any royalties or other payments provided for in any
such license or agreement, (ii) cause the forfeiture or termination of any
AXENT IP Rights, (iii) give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of

material respect any license or agreement between AXENT or any of its
Subsidiaries and any third party or (ii) infringes in any material respect
any patents or other intellectual property rights of any other party; and
there is no pending or, to the knowledge of AXENT, threatened claim or
litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right to use, sell, license
or dispose of any AXENT IP Rights, or asserting that any AXENT IP Rights or
the proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof, or the manufacture,
use or sale of any AXENT products, conflicts or will conflict with the rights
of any other party.   (d) AXENT has heretofore provided to Symantec a
worldwide list of all patents, trade names, trademarks and service marks, and
applications for any of the foregoing owned or possessed by AXENT or any of
its Subsidiaries and true and complete copies of such materials have been
made available to Symantec.   (e) AXENT has provided to Symantec a true and
complete copy of its standard form of employee confidentiality agreement and
taken commercially reasonably necessary steps to ensure that all employees
have executed such an agreement. All consultants or third parties with access
to proprietary information of AXENT have executed appropriate agreements or
are otherwise under obligations not to disclose confidential AXENT IP
Rights.   (f) Neither AXENT nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware or has
reason to believe that any of its employees or consultants is obligated under
any contract, covenant or other agreement or commitment of any nature, or
subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative
agency, that would interfere with the use of such employee\'s or
consultant\'s best efforts to promote the interests of AXENT and its
Subsidiaries or that would conflict with the business of AXENT as presently
conducted or proposed to be conducted. Neither AXENT nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement to indemnify any other person,
including but not limited to any employee or consultant of AXENT or any of
its Subsidiaries, against any charge of infringement, misappropriation or
misuse of any intellectual property, other than indemnification provisions
contained in purchase orders, license agreements, distribution agreements or
other agreements arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge
of AXENT, all current and former employees and   11  18  consultants of
any of AXENT or any of its Subsidiaries have signed valid and enforceable
written assignments to AXENT or its Subsidiaries of any and all rights or
claims in any intellectual property that any such employee or consultant has
or may have by reason of any contribution, participation or other role in the
development, conception, creation, reduction to practice or authorship of any
invention, innovation, development or work of authorship or any other
intellectual property that is used in the business of AXENT, and AXENT and
its Subsidiaries possess signed copies of all such written assignments
by such employees and consultants.   3.18 Taxes.   (a) For the purposes
of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" refers to any and all federal, state,
local and foreign taxes, assessments and other governmental charges, duties,
impositions and liabilities relating to taxes, including taxes based upon or
measured by gross receipts, income, profits, sales, use and occupation, and
value added, ad valorem, transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll,
recapture, employment, excise and property taxes, together with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts and
any obligations under any agreements or arrangements with any other person
with respect to such amounts and including any liability for taxes of a
predecessor entity. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Return" or "Tax
Returns" refers to all federal, state and local and foreign returns,
estimates, information statements and reports relating to Taxes.   (b)
AXENT and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all Tax Returns required to
have been filed by them, and have paid (or AXENT has paid on behalf of
its Subsidiaries), all Taxes required to have been paid as shown on such
Tax Returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the AXENT SEC
Reports reflect an adequate accrual (which accruals were established in
accordance with GAAP) for the payment of all Taxes payable by AXENT and its
Subsidiaries, as of the date of such financial statements. Except as

to, and payments from, the Pension Plans which are required to have been made
in accordance with the Pension Plans have been timely made, except where the
failure to make such contributions or payments on a timely basis would not,

reasonably be expected to have an AXENT Material Adverse Effect.   (d) All
of AXENT\'s Pension Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code

respect to the operation of such plan or   13  20  asserting any rights

either impair AXENT\'s ability to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or reasonably be expected to have an AXENT
Material Adverse Effect in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit
or proceeding.   (f) None of AXENT, any of its Subsidiaries or any employee
of the foregoing, nor any trustee, administrator, other fiduciary or any
other "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the
Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as
such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA)

aggregate, either impair AXENT\'s ability to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby or reasonably be expected to have an
AXENT Material Adverse Effect.   (g) None of AXENT, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their ERISA Affiliates currently maintain or contribute to any

Welfare Plans maintained by AXENT or any of its Subsidiaries provides for
continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant following termination of employment, except as may be required
under COBRA, or except at the expense of the participant or
the participant\'s beneficiary. AXENT and each of its Subsidiaries which
maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code have complied with the notice and continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and the regulations thereunder except where the failure to comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, either impair AXENT\'s ability to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
reasonably be expected to have an AXENT Material Adverse Effect.   (l) No
liability under any Pension Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan has been funded nor
has any such obligation been satisfied with the purchase of a contract from
an insurance company as to which AXENT or any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice that such insurance company is in rehabilitation or
a comparable proceeding.   (m) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19(m), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or accelerate
the vesting or timing of payment of any benefits or compensation payable to
or in respect of any employee of AXENT or any of its Subsidiaries.   (n)
AXENT and each of its Subsidiaries and each of the Foreign Plans are
in compliance with applicable laws, and all required contributions have been
made to the Foreign Plans, except where the failure to comply or make
contributions would not, individually or in the aggregate, either impair
AXENT\'s ability to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or have an AXENT Material   14  21  Adverse Effect.
Except to the extent that such underfunding would be reasonably expected to
have an AXENT Material Adverse Effect, each of the Foreign Plans that is a
funded defined benefit pension plan has a fair market value of plan assets
that is greater than the plan\'s liabilities, as determined in
accordance with applicable laws. For purposes hereof, the term "Foreign Plan"
shall mean any plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement maintained or
contributed to by, or entered into with, AXENT or any Subsidiary with respect
to employees (or former employees) employed outside the United States to the
extent the benefits provided thereunder are not mandated by the laws of the
applicable foreign jurisdiction.   (o) Except in any such case if such,
payment, acceleration would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an
AXENT Material Adverse Effect, each of the Employee Benefit Plans and the
Foreign Plans can be terminated by AXENT within a reasonable period following
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such Plan (and the
provisions of ERISA and the Code), without any additional contribution to
such Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan or the payment of any additional
compensation or amount or the additional vesting or acceleration of any
vesting provided under the Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan.   3.20

exceptions set forth in the disclosure statement (the "Symantec Disclosure
Statement"). The Symantec Disclosure Statement shall be arranged in schedules
corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections of this Article IV, and

are duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and are each in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased
properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing

which does not affect Symantec in a materially disproportionate manner, shall
not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a "Symantec Material Adverse Effect";
(ii) any adverse change, event or effect relating to or affecting the
software industry generally or the security software industry generally,
which does not affect Symantec in a materially disproportionate manner, shall
not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a "Symantec Material Adverse Effect"; and
(iii) any adverse change, event or effect arising from or relating to the
announcement or pendency of the Merger, including, but not limited to,
changes or effects which result from the loss of customers or
delay, cancellation or cessation of orders for Symantec products, shall not
be deemed to constitute, and shall not be taken into account in determining
whether there has been, a "Symantec Material Adverse Effect".   (b) Neither
Symantec, the Symantec Subsidiaries or Merger Sub is in violation of any
provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
documents.   4.2 Authority Relative to This Agreement. Each of Symantec and
Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and
validly authorized by the unanimous vote of the board of directors of each of

contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
as required by Delaware Law, (ii) the filing with the SEC and the

authorization, consent or approval would not prevent or materially delay the
Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay AXENT from performing its
obligations under this Agreement or, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Symantec and
Merger Sub with all of the provisions hereof will (i) conflict with or result
in any breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other charter documents of Symantec or any Symantec Subsidiary, (ii) violate
any material order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Symantec or any Symantec Subsidiary, or by which any of their
properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) result in a violation or breach
of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any material note,   19  26  bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Symantec or any Symantec Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them
or any of their properties or assets may be bound, except in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches, violations,
defaults or other occurrences that would not (x) individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect,
or (y) prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   4.4 Capitalization. The
authorized capital stock of Symantec consists of 100,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, $0.01 par value, of which there were 60,993,287 shares issued and
outstanding as of July 25, 2000, and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$0.01 par value, of which no shares are issued or outstanding as of July 25,
2000, there are no warrants, options, convertible securities, calls, rights,
stock appreciation rights, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, or
agreements or commitments of any nature obligating Symantec to issue, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of Symantec, or obligating Symantec
to grant, issue, extend, accelerate the vesting of, or enter into, any such
warrant, option, convertible security, call, right, stock appreciation right,
preemptive right, right of first refusal, agreement or commitment.
The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of Common
Stock, $0.001 par value, 100 of which, as of the date hereof, are issued
and outstanding and are held by Symantec. Merger Sub was formed for the
purpose of consummating the Merger and has no material assets or liabilities
except as necessary for such purpose. All outstanding shares of Symantec
Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights created by statute,
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Symantec or any agreement to
which Symantec is a party or by which it is bound.   4.5 Registration
Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information supplied by
Symantec for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus as it relates to Symantec or
Merger Sub, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective or
at the date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed
to stockholders, respectively, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to Symantec
or any Symantec Subsidiary shall occur which is required to be described in
the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such event
shall be so described, and an amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
AXENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Symantec makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by AXENT which is contained
in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   4.6
SEC Filings. Symantec has filed with the SEC all required forms, reports,
registration statements and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC
(collectively, all such forms, reports, registration statements and documents
filed after January 1, 1997 are referred to herein as the "Symantec SEC
Reports"), all of which complied as to form when filed in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be. Accurate and complete copies of the
Symantec SEC reports have been made available to AXENT. The Symantec SEC
Reports (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein) did not, at the time they were filed (or,
if amended or superseded by filing prior to the date hereof, then on the date
of such filing), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except as disclosed in the Symantec SEC Reports, to the
knowledge of Symantec, each of Symantec\'s officers and directors has
complied with all filing requirements under Section 13 and Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, the "knowledge of Symantec"
shall mean the actual knowledge of Symantec\'s directors and executive
officers.   4.7 Compliance with Laws. Neither Symantec nor any Symantec
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
rule or regulation (including, without limitation, relating to the export or
import of goods or technology) of any foreign, federal, state or local
government or any other governmental department or agency, except where any
such violations or failures to comply would not, individually or in the  
20  27  aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Symantec Material
Adverse Effect. Symantec and Merger Sub have all permits, licenses and
franchises from governmental agencies required to conduct their businesses as
now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except for those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect.   4.8 Financial
Statements. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Symantec SEC Reports (the
"Symantec Financial Statements"), (x) was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act) and (y) fairly presented the consolidated financial position of
Symantec and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, consistent with the books and records of Symantec, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to
be, material in amount. The balance sheet of Symantec contained in
Symantec\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 is hereinafter
referred to as the "Symantec Balance Sheet."   4.9 Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities. Neither Symantec nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than liabilities or
obligations: (i) included in the Symantec Balance Sheet and the related notes
to the financial statements; (ii) reflected in the Symantec SEC Reports
through the date of the filing of Symantec\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K in
respect of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000; (iii) liabilities incurred
since the Reference Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have an Symantec Material Adverse Effect; (iv) which are not
and will not have, individually or in the aggregate, an Symantec Material
Adverse Effect; and (v) under this Agreement.   4.10 Absence of Changes or
Events. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, between March 31, 2000 and
the date of this Agreement, Symantec has not incurred, suffered or made: (i)
any Symantec Material Adverse Effect as of the date of this Agreement; (ii)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of
Symantec\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' capital stock, or any purchase,
redemption or other acquisition by Symantec of any of Symantec\'s capital
stock or any other securities of Symantec or its Subsidiaries or any options,
warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other securities
except for repurchases which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material in amount from employees following their termination pursuant to the
terms of their pre-existing stock option or purchase agreements; (iii) any
material change by Symantec in its accounting methods, principles
or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in GAAP; (iv) any
material revaluation by Symantec of any of its material assets, including
writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of
business; or (v) any amendment to the Symantec certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, or any other charter document, or execution of any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or recapitalization.  
4.11 Litigation.   (a) Except as set forth in Symantec\'s Form 10-K for the
year ended March 31, 2000, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Symantec, threatened against Symantec or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective officers and directors (in their capacities as such), or
involving any of their assets, before any court, or governmental or
regulatory authority or body, or arbitration tribunal, except for those
Actions which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect. There is no Action
pending or, to the knowledge of Symantec, threatened which in any manner
challenges, seeks to, or is reasonably likely to prevent, enjoin, alter or
delay the transactions anticipated by this Agreement.   (b) There is no
outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court,
governmental or regulatory authority or body, or arbitration tribunal in a
proceeding to which Symantec, any Subsidiary of Symantec, or any of
their assets is or was a party or by which Symantec, any Subsidiary of
Symantec, or any of   21  28  their assets is bound, except for those
judgments, orders, writs, injunctions or decrees which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Symantec Material
Adverse Effect.   4.12 Fairness Opinion. Symantec has received the opinion
of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation dated the date of this
Agreement to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the consideration paid
by Symantec in the Merger is fair to Symantec from a financial point of
view.   4.13 [Intentionally Omitted].   4.14 [Intentionally Omitted].  
4.15 Officer\'s Certificate as to Tax Matters. Symantec knows of no
reason why it will be unable to deliver to Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe
LLP and Shaw Pittman LLP at the Closing an Officer\'s Certificate in form
sufficient to enable each such counsel to render the opinions required by
Section 6.6.   4.16 Taxes. Symantec and each of its Subsidiaries have filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and have paid (or Symantec has
paid on behalf of its Subsidiaries), all Taxes required to be paid as shown
on such Tax Returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the
Symantec SEC Reports reflect an adequate accrual (which accruals were
established in accordance with GAAP) for the payment of all Taxes payable by
Symantec and its Subsidiaries, as of the date of such financial statements.
Except as reasonably would not be expected to have a Symantec Material
Adverse Effect, no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against Symantec or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Symantec nor
any of its Subsidiaries has filed for any extension of time to file any Tax
Return. None of Symantec and its Subsidiaries is aware of any reason why the
Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.   4.17 Intellectual Property. Except where the
failure of any of the following representations to be true would not be
reasonably expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect:   (a)
Symantec and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all  intellectual
property used to conduct their respective businesses (such  intellectual
property and the rights thereto are collectively referred to  herein as the
"Symantec IP Rights").   (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not constitute a  material breach of any instrument or agreement governing
any Symantec IP  Rights, will not (i) cause the modification of any terms of
any licenses or  agreements relating to any Symantec IP Rights including but
not limited to  the modification of the effective rate of any royalties or
other payments  provided for in any such license or agreement, (ii) cause the
forfeiture or  termination of any Symantec IP Rights, (iii) give rise to a
right of  forfeiture or termination of any Symantec IP Rights or (iv)
materially  impair the right of Symantec to use, sell or license any Symantec
IP Rights  or portion thereof.   (c) Neither the manufacture, marketing,
license, sale or intended use  of any product or technology currently
licensed or sold or under  development by Symantec or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) violates in any  material respect any license or agreement between
Symantec or any of its  Subsidiaries and any third party or (ii) infringes in
any material respect  any patents or other intellectual property rights of
any other party; and  there is no pending or, to the knowledge of Symantec,
threatened claim or  litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right
to use, sell,  license or dispose of any Symantec IP Rights, or asserting
that any  Symantec IP Rights or the proposed use, sale, license or
disposition  thereof, or the manufacture, use or sale of any Symantec
products,  conflicts or will conflict with the rights of any other party.  
(d) Neither Symantec nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware or has  reason to
believe that any of its employees or consultants is obligated  under any
contract, covenant or other agreement or commitment of any  nature, or
subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or  administrative
agency, that would interfere with the use of such employee\'s  or
consultant\'s best efforts to promote the interests of Symantec and its 
Subsidiaries or that would conflict with the business of Symantec as 
presently conducted or proposed to be conducted. Neither Symantec nor any  of
its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement to indemnify any other 
person, including but not limited to any employee or consultant of Symantec 
or   22  29   any of its Subsidiaries, against any charge of
infringement,  misappropriation or misuse of any intellectual property, other
than  indemnification provisions contained in purchase orders, license 
agreements, distribution agreements or other agreements arising in the 
ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of Symantec, all current and 
former employees and consultants of any of Symantec or any of its 
Subsidiaries have signed valid and enforceable written assignments to 
Symantec or its Subsidiaries of any and all rights or claims in any 
intellectual property that any such employee or consultant has or may have 
by reason of any contribution, participation or other role in the 
development, conception, creation, reduction to practice or authorship of 
any invention, innovation, development or work of authorship or any other 
intellectual property that is used in the business of Symantec, and  Symantec
and its Subsidiaries possess signed copies of all such written  assignments
by such employees and consultants.   4.18 Year 2000 Compliance. All of
Symantec\'s products currently being sold, both individually and when
operating in conjunction with all other systems or products with which they
are designed to interface, are Year 2000 Compliant.   ARTICLE V  
COVENANTS   5.1 Conduct of Business During Interim Period. Except as
contemplated or required by this Agreement or as expressly consented to in
writing by Symantec, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the termination

will (i) conduct its operations according to its ordinary and usual course of

action which would adversely affect its ability to consummate the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this

prior written consent of Symantec (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), directly or indirectly, do any of the following:   (a) enter
into, violate, extend, amend or otherwise modify or waive  any of the terms
of (i) any material joint venture, license (other than end  user licenses),
or agreement relating to the joint development or transfer  of technology or
AXENT IP Rights or (ii) except in the ordinary course of  business and
consistent with past practice, any other material agreements,  commitments or
contracts (including end user licenses);   (b) split, combine or reclassify
any shares of its capital stock;   (c) except as permitted in Section 5.4(e)
of this Agreement authorize,  solicit, propose or announce an intention to

an agreement with any  other person with respect to, any plan of liquidation
or dissolution, any  acquisition of a material amount of assets or
securities, any disposition  of a material amount of assets or securities,
any material change in  capitalization, or any material partnership,
association, joint venture,  joint development, technology transfer, or other
material business  alliance;   (d) fail to renew any insurance policy
naming it as a beneficiary or a  loss payee, or take any steps or fail to
take any steps that would permit  any insurance policy naming it as a
beneficiary or a loss payee to be  canceled, terminated or materially
altered, except in the ordinary course  of business and consistent with past
practice and following written notice  to Symantec;   (e) maintain its
books and records in a manner other than in the  ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice;   23  30   (f) enter into any hedging,
option, derivative or other similar  transaction or any foreign exchange
position or contract for the exchange  of currency other than in the ordinary
course of business and consistent  with past practice;   (g) institute any
change in its accounting methods, principles or  practices other than as
required by GAAP, or the rules and regulations  promulgated by the SEC, or
revalue any assets, including without  limitation, writing down the value of
inventory or writing off notes or  accounts receivables;   (h) in respect
of any Taxes, make or change any material election,  change any accounting
method, enter into any closing agreement, settle any  material claim or
assessment, or consent to any extension or waiver of the  limitation period
applicable to any material claim or assessment except as  required by
applicable law;   (i) suspend, terminate or otherwise discontinue any
planned or ongoing  material research and development activities, programs or
other such  activities;   (j) issue any capital stock or other options,
warrants or other rights  to purchase or acquire capital stock, other than:
(i) the grant or exercise  of purchase rights pursuant to the AXENT Purchase
Plan as contemplated by  Section 2.2(b); (ii) the exercise of AXENT Options
outstanding as of the  date of this Agreement; or (iii) AXENT Options granted
in the ordinary  course of business consistent with past practice under the
AXENT Stock  Plans to newly-hired employees of AXENT; provided that AXENT
shall not  grant in any calendar month between the date of this Agreement and
the  Effective Time, AXENT Options to purchase, in the aggregate, a number
of  shares of AXENT Common Stock in excess of 110% of the monthly average
of  the number of shares of AXENT Common Stock subject to AXENT Options
granted  in the six calendar months prior to the date of this Agreement;
or   (k) take or agree to take, any of the actions described in Section 
3.10, or any action which would make any of its representations or 
warranties contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent it 
from performing or cause it not to perform its covenants hereunder.   5.2 No
Solicitation.   (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII,
AXENT and its Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of
their respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by
any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or
induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as
hereinafter defined), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as to the existence of these
provisions, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 5.2 or in any other provision of this Agreement,
AXENT and its board of directors: (i) may furnish information to, or
participate in discussions with, any third party that has made an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal (a "Potential Acquiror") that the board reasonably
concludes may lead to a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.4(e) hereof);
and (ii) may participate in discussions or negotiations with any Potential
Acquiror or approve an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if the board is
advised by its financial advisor that the Potential Acquiror submitting such
Acquisition Proposal has the financial wherewithal to be reasonably capable
of consummating such an Acquisition Proposal, and the board determines in
good faith, (A) after receiving advice from its financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.4(e)
hereof), and (B) after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure
to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such
information or approve an Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the
board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law. AXENT agrees that any non-
public information furnished to a Potential Acquiror will be pursuant to a
confidentiality, standstill and nonsolicitation agreement containing
provisions at least as favorable to AXENT   24  31  as the
confidentiality, standstill and nonsolicitation provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.3). In the event that
AXENT shall determine to provide any information as described above, or shall
receive any Acquisition Proposal (or any material amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal previously received), it shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours, inform Symantec in writing as to that fact and shall furnish to
Symantec the identity of the recipient of such information to be provided
and/or the Potential Acquiror and the terms of such Acquisition Proposal (or
material amendment).   For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by Symantec) relating to any Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of
related transactions involving: (A) any purchase from AXENT or acquisition by
any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 30% interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of AXENT or any of its subsidiaries or
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 30% or more of the
total outstanding voting securities of AXENT or any of its subsidiaries or
any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving AXENT; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than 30% of the assets of
AXENT; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of AXENT.   (b) In addition to
the obligations of AXENT set forth in Section 5.2(a), AXENT as promptly as
practicable shall advise Symantec orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information or inquiry which AXENT
reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or to
any Acquisition Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. AXENT will
keep Symantec informed as promptly as practicable in all material respects of
the status and details (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.   5.3
Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, AXENT and Symantec will each afford to the other and their authorized
representatives (including counsel, environmental and other consultants,
accountants, auditors and agents) reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice to all of its facilities, personnel and
operations and to all of its and its Subsidiaries books and records,
will permit the other and its authorized representatives to conduct
inspections as they may reasonably request and will instruct its officers and
those of its Subsidiaries to furnish such persons with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to its business and
properties as they may from time to time reasonably request, subject to the
restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 19,
2000 between Symantec and AXENT (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Symantec
and Merger Sub agree that each of them will treat any such information in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.   5.4 Special Meetings;
Registration Statement; Board Recommendations.   (a) AXENT Special Meeting.
Promptly after the date hereof, subject to Section 5.4(e), AXENT will take
all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of AXENT\'s stockholders to
consider adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the "AXENT
Special Meeting") to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to
the extent permissible under applicable law) within 45 days after the
declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Subject
to Section 5.4(e), AXENT will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger and will take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law to obtain such approvals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, AXENT
may adjourn or postpone the AXENT Special Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to AXENT\'s stockholders in advance of a
vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of the   25  32  time
for which the AXENT Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of
AXENT Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the AXENT Special Meeting. AXENT
shall ensure that the AXENT Special Meeting is called, noticed, convened,
held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by AXENT in connection
with the AXENT Special Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the Delaware
Law, AXENT\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq
and all other applicable legal requirements.   (b) Symantec Special
Meeting. Promptly after the date hereof, Symantec will take all action
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of Symantec\'s stockholders
to consider the issuance of Symantec Common Stock in the Merger (the
"Symantec Special Meeting") to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any
event (to the extent permissible under applicable law) within 45 days after
the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Symantec will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the issuance of Symantec Common Stock in the Merger and
will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of its stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law
to obtain such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Symantec may adjourn or postpone the Symantec Special
Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to Symantec\'s
stockholders in advance of a vote on the issuance of Symantec Common Stock in
the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the Symantec
Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Symantec Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Symantec Special Meeting. Symantec shall
ensure that the Symantec Special Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held
and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Symantec in connection with
the Symantec Special Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the Delaware
Law, Symantec\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq
and all other applicable legal requirements.   (c) Subject to Section
5.4(e): (i) the board of directors of AXENT shall unanimously recommend that
AXENT\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement
and approve the Merger at the AXENT Special Meeting; (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the board
of directors of AXENT has unanimously recommended that AXENT\'s stockholders
vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the
AXENT Special Meeting; and (iii) neither the board of directors of AXENT nor
any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve
to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Symantec, the unanimous
recommendation of the board of directors of AXENT that AXENT\'s stockholders
vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger. For
purposes of this Agreement, said recommendation of the board of directors
shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Symantec if said
recommendation shall no longer be unanimous, provided that, for all purposes
of this Agreement, an action by any board of directors or committee thereof
shall be unanimous if each member of such board of directors or committee has
approved such action other than (i) any such member who has appropriately
abstained from voting on such matter because of an actual or potential
conflict of interest and (ii) any such member who is unable to vote
in connection with such action as a result of death or disability.   (d)
(i) the board of directors of Symantec shall unanimously recommend
that Symantec\'s stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of Symantec
Common Stock in the Merger at the Symantec Special Meeting; (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the
board of directors of Symantec has unanimously recommended that Symantec\'s
stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of Symantec Common Stock in the
Merger at the Symantec Special Meeting; and (iii) neither the board of
directors of Symantec nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to AXENT, the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of
Symantec that Symantec\'s stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of
Symantec Common Stock in the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, said
recommendation of the board of directors shall be deemed to have been
modified in a manner adverse to AXENT if said recommendation shall no longer
be   26  33  unanimous, provided that, for all purposes of this
Agreement, an action by any board of directors or committee thereof shall be
unanimous if each member of such board of directors or committee has approved
such action other than (i) any such member who has appropriately abstained
from voting on such matter because of an actual or potential conflict of
interest and (ii) any such member who is unable to vote in connection with
such action as a result of death or disability.   (e) Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the board of directors of AXENT from withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its unanimous recommendation in favor of
the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to AXENT and is
not withdrawn, (ii) AXENT shall have provided written notice to Symantec (a
"Notice of Superior Offer") advising Symantec that AXENT has received a
Superior Offer, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Offer and identifying the person or entity making such Superior Offer, (iii)
Symantec shall not have, within five (5) business days of Symantec\'s receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal, made an offer that AXENT Board by a
majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (based on the written
advice of its financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to
AXENT\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that AXENT
Board shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Symantec promptly
following the receipt thereof), (iv) the board of directors of AXENT
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that,
in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify such recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of the board of directors of AXENT to AXENT\'s stockholders under
applicable law and (v) AXENT shall not have violated any of the restrictions
set forth in Section 5.2 or this Section 5.4(e). AXENT shall provide Symantec
with at least three business days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice
as provided to the members of AXENT\'s board of directors but in no event
less than twenty-four hours) of any meeting of AXENT\'s board of directors at
which AXENT\'s board of directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement "Superior Offer"
shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to
consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation
involving AXENT pursuant to which the stockholders of AXENT immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than a majority of the equity interest
in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii)
the acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or
an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer followed
with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving AXENT), directly
or indirectly, of ownership of 90% of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of AXENT, on terms that the board of directors of AXENT determines, in
its reasonable judgment (based on the written advice of its financial
advisor) to be more favorable to AXENT stockholders than the terms of the
Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a
"Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely in the
reasonable judgment of AXENT\'s board of directors (based on the advice of
its financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a timely
basis.   (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit AXENT or its
board of directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.   (g) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
AXENT and Symantec shall mutually prepare, and AXENT shall file with the SEC,
a preliminary form of the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus. As promptly
as practicable following receipt of SEC comments on such preliminary Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Symantec and AXENT shall mutually prepare a
response to such comments. Upon resolution of all comments, Symantec shall
file the Registration Statement with the SEC. Symantec and AXENT shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to have the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Symantec shall also
take any action required to be taken under applicable state blue sky or
securities laws in connection with Symantec Common Stock to be issued in
exchange for the shares of AXENT Common Stock. Symantec and AXENT shall
promptly furnish to each other all information, and take such other actions
(including without limitation using all commercially reasonable efforts to
provide any required consents of their respective independent auditors), as
may reasonably be requested in connection with any action by any of them in
connection with the preceding sentences of this Section 5.4(g). Whenever
any   27  34  party learns of the occurrence of any event which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other filing made
pursuant to this Section 5.4(g), Symantec or AXENT, as the case may be, shall
promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
SEC or its staff and/or mailing to stockholders of AXENT such amendment or
supplement.   (h) Subject to Section 5.4(e), the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall contain the unanimous recommendation of the board
of directors of AXENT in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement.   (i) The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall contain the
unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of Symantec in favor of
the issuance of Symantec Common Stock in the Merger.   5.5 Commercially
Reasonable Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, Symantec, Merger Sub and AXENT shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or appropriate under this Agreement,
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
(i) promptly filing Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and responding as promptly
as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation, (ii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary governmental and
private party consents, approvals or waivers, and (iii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to lift any legal bar to the Merger. Symantec shall cause
Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Symantec,
nor the Surviving Corporation, nor any of their Subsidiaries shall
be required to (i) divest, hold separate or license any business(es),
product line(s) or asset(s), (ii) take any action or accept any limitation
that would reasonably be expected to have a Symantec Material Adverse Effect
or an AXENT Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) agree to any of the
foregoing.   5.6 Public Announcements. Before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, Symantec, Merger Sub and AXENT
agree to consult with each other as to its form and substance, and agree not
to issue any such press release or general communication to employees or make
any public statement prior to obtaining the consent of the other (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable law or by the rules and regulations of or listing agreement with
Nasdaq or as may otherwise be required by Nasdaq or the SEC.   5.7
Notification of Certain Matters. Each of AXENT and Symantec shall promptly
notify the other party of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
respective occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of the notifying party to
effect the Merger not to be fulfilled. Each of AXENT and Symantec shall also
give prompt notice to the other of any communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.   5.8
Indemnification.   (a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Symantec shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor, the provisions with respect to
indemnification, the advancement of fees and expenses, and exculpation that
are at least as favorable with respect to AXENT, its Subsidiaries and the
Indemnified Parties as those set forth in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of AXENT as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties. In addition, Symantec shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor the obligations of AXENT
pursuant to indemnification agreements and agreements for   28 
35  advancement of fees and expenses between AXENT and any of the
Indemnified Parties which are listed in Section 3.14 of the AXENT Disclosure
Statement and provisions for any indemnification, advancement of fees and
expenses and exculpation under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
AXENT as in effect on the date hereof. "Indemnified Parties" shall include
each person who is or was a director or officer of AXENT or any Subsidiary of
AXENT at any time before the Effective Time, and each person who serves or
has in the past served at the request of AXENT or any subsidiary of AXENT as
a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at any time before the Effective
Time.   (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Symantec
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against and from
any costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (and whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), to the extent arising out of or pertaining to any
action or omission in his or her capacity as a director or officer of AXENT
arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event of the commencement or assertion of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for
any period after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to
Symantec, (ii) after the Effective Time, Symantec shall pay or cause to be
paid the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after
statements therefor are received and (iii) Symantec shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that neither Symantec nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided,
further, that, in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims (and the matters giving rise thereto)
shall continue until the disposition of any and all such claims (and the
matters giving rise thereto). The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain
only one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them
with respect to any single action unless any Indemnified Party determines in
good faith (after consultation with legal counsel) that there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. In the event Symantec or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 5.8, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Symantec and
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.8, and none of the actions described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be taken
until such provision is made.   (c) Without limiting any of the obligations
of Symantec or the Surviving Corporation set forth elsewhere in this Section
5.8, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Symantec shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, to the extent available,
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by AXENT\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy on terms no less favorable to such persons as those applicable under
the policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance currently
maintained by AXENT; provided, however, that in no event shall Symantec or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for coverage for any one year
in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by AXENT for such
coverage, and that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated instead to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.   (d) Symantec shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform
its obligations under this Section 5.8 and shall, in addition, guarantee,
as co-obligor with the Surviving Corporation, the performance of such
obligations by the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Each Indemnified Party
shall comply with the reasonable requests of the Surviving Corporation or
Symantec in defending or settling any action hereunder; provided, however,
that no proposed settlement of any such action need be considered by any
Indemnified Party if (A) such settlement involves no finding or   29 
36  admission of any liability by any Indemnified Party and (B) the sole
relief provided in connection with such settlement is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Surviving Corporation or Symantec.   (f) This
Section 5.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to
benefit AXENT, the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified Party, shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
and Symantec, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties.   5.9

with the execution and delivery hereof, AXENT shall deliver to Symantec a
list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Symantec), setting forth the
names of all persons who are expected to be, at the Effective Time, in
AXENT\'s reasonable judgment, Affiliates of AXENT. AXENT shall furnish such
information and documents as Symantec may reasonably request for the purpose
of reviewing such list. AXENT shall deliver a written agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (an "AXENT Affiliate Agreement")
executed by each person identified as an Affiliate in the list furnished
pursuant to this Section 5.10(a) within ten (10) days after the execution of

Time, AXENT shall deliver to Symantec at no cost the resignations of such
directors and officers of AXENT and its Subsidiaries as Symantec shall

registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.   5.14 Form

or other appropriate form under the Securities Act, to register Symantec

Matters. AXENT shall give prompt notice to Symantec and Merger Sub, and
Symantec and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to AXENT, of (i) the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure of the AXENT, Symantec or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder,

case may be.   5.16 SEC Filings.   (a) AXENT will deliver promptly to

and Symantec, Merger Sub and AXENT agree to deliver officer\'s certificates
to counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel, on which counsel
may rely in rendering such opinions. If counsel to either Symantec or AXENT

Symantec  Material Adverse Effect.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION   8.1
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after the requisite approval of
the stockholders of AXENT:   (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized
by the boards of  directors of Symantec and AXENT;   (b) by either AXENT or
Symantec if the Merger shall not have been  consummated by January 31, 2001
(the "End Date") for any reason; provided,  however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement   33  40   under this Section 8.1(b) shall not
be available to any party whose action  or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure  of the Merger to occur on or

failure to act constitutes a material breach by AXENT of this Agreement.  
(e) by AXENT or Symantec if the required approval of the stockholders  of
Symantec contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by 
reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of Symantec 
stockholders duly convened therefore or at any adjournment thereof; 
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this 
Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to Symantec where the failure to 
obtain Symantec stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action  or

time prior to the Effective Time) if an AXENT  Triggering Event (as defined

forth in this Agreement, or if any  representation or warranty of Symantec
shall have become untrue, in either  case such that the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b)  would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or as of the time such  representation or warranty shall have
become untrue, provided that such  inaccuracy in Symantec\'s representations
and warranties or breach by  Symantec remains uncured on the date which is
twenty (20) business days  following written notice of such breach or
inaccuracy from AXENT to  Symantec (it being understood that AXENT may not
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this paragraph (g) if it shall have
materially breached this  Agreement and remains in breach of this agreement
as of the date of such  termination);   (h) by Symantec, upon a breach of

have become untrue, in  either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or Section  7.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of

warranties or breach by  AXENT remains uncured on the date which is twenty

offer.   8.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination

(miscellaneous), each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms.   8.3 Fees and Expenses.   (a)
General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Symantec
and AXENT shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys\'
and accountants fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the printing and
filing (with the SEC) of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any
preliminary materials related thereto) and the Registration Statement
(including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendments or
supplements thereto. Symantec shall pay all fees and expenses in connection
with any filings under the HSR Act.   (b) AXENT Payments. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated by Symantec or AXENT, as applicable, pursuant to
Sections 8.1(b), (d) or (f), AXENT shall promptly, but in no event later than
two days after the date of such termination, pay Symantec a fee equal to
$28.0 million, plus all reasonable documented expenses incurred by Symantec
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
in immediately available funds (the "Termination Fee"); provided, that in the
case of termination under Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(d): (i) such payment shall be
made only if following the date hereof and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, a third party has publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and
within nine (9) months following the termination of this Agreement an AXENT
Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated or AXENT enters into an
agreement providing for an AXENT Acquisition and such AXENT Acquisition is
later consummated with the person (or another person controlling, controlled

entered into (regardless of when such consummation occurs if AXENT has
entered into such an agreement within such nine-month period), and (ii) such
payment shall be made promptly, but in no event later than two days after the
consummation of such AXENT Acquisition (regardless of when such consummation
occurs if AXENT has entered into such an agreement within such nine-month
period) in immediately available funds. AXENT acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Symantec would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
AXENT fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b) , and, in order to obtain such payment, Symantec makes a claim
that results in a judgment against AXENT for the amounts set forth in this
Section 8.3(b), AXENT shall pay to Symantec its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3(b)
at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this
Section 8.3(b) shall be credited toward any damages payable by AXENT in the
event of breach of this Agreement.   35  42   For the purposes of this
Agreement "AXENT Acquisition" shall mean any of the following transactions
(other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (i) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving AXENT pursuant to which the
stockholders of AXENT immediately preceding such transaction hold less than
50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction, (ii) a sale or other disposition by AXENT of
assets representing in excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of
AXENT\'s business immediately prior to such sale or (iii) the acquisition by
any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer
or issuance by AXENT), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 50%
of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of
AXENT.   8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of Symantec and AXENT.   8.5 Extension;
Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party hereto may, to the

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.  
ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 Amendment and Modification. Subject to
applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only
by written agreement of Symantec, Merger Sub and AXENT at any time prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that after approval of this Agreement
by the stockholders of AXENT, no such amendment or modification shall change
the amount or form of the consideration to be received by AXENT\'s
stockholders in the Merger.   9.2 Waiver of Compliance; Consents. Any
failure of Symantec or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or AXENT, on the other
hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived by AXENT (with respect to any failure by Symantec or Merger
Sub) or Symantec or Merger Sub (with respect to any failure by AXENT),
respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever
this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of any party
hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with
the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this
Section 9.2.   9.3 Survival; Investigations. The respective representations
and warranties of Symantec, Merger Sub and AXENT contained herein or in
any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or at the Closing
