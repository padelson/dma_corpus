Indemnified Company Person shall receive advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any claim, Action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser from the
Indemnified Company Person of a request therefor; provided that any

of such coverage is in excess of $150,000, then Purchaser shall obtain as
much coverage as is possible at a cost up to $150,000.   (e) In the event
that any of the Company, Purchaser or their respective successors or
permitted assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or the transferee thereof, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this SECTION 5.6.   (f) This SECTION 5.6 is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Company Persons and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Company Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.    -31-

to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Company under such
Material Contracts from and after the Closing Date. Such consents, waivers

event that the other parties to any such Material Contracts (including any
lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property) conditions its grant of a
consent, waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased rent
payments or other payments under the Material Contract), then Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for making all payments or other accommodations
required to obtain such consent, waiver or approval.   SECTION 5.8 FIRPTA
Compliance. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a
FIRPTA Compliance Certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser.   SECTION 5.9 Additional Instruments and Further Assurances.

another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and
do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) At and after the Closing Date, to
the extent that Purchaser discovers that legal ownership of any issued or
registered Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property for which
applications for registration are pending which the Company is entitled to
own under SECTION 3.18(B) is not held by or recorded in the name of the
Company, Seller agrees to assign and transfer and take such further
additional actions as may be reasonably necessary and reasonably requested by
Purchaser to document, register and cause to be assigned and transferred to
the Company effective as of the Closing Date all such issued or registered
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property for which applications for
registration are pending, including all causes of action and the right to
past and future damages for infringement of such issued or registered
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property for which applications for
registration are pending.   (c) At and after the Closing Date, to the extent
that Seller demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that legal
ownership of any issued or registered Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property for which applications for registration are pending which the
Company is not entitled to own under SECTION 3.18(B) are set forth on SECTION
3.18(C)(I) of the Disclosure Letter in error, Purchaser agrees to assign and
transfer and take such further additional actions as may be reasonably
necessary and reasonably requested by Seller to document, register and cause
to be assigned and transferred to Seller effective as of the Closing Date all
such issued or registered Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property for
which applications for registration are pending, including all causes of
action and the right to past and    -32-    future damages for
infringement of such issued or registered Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property for which applications for registration
are pending.   SECTION 5.10 Books and Records. Purchaser and Seller shall
retain all of the books and records of or with respect to the Company for a
period of three (3) years after the Closing or for such longer time as may be
required by Law and shall provide assistance as reasonably requested and make
such books and records (or copies thereof) available to the other party or
its respective agents, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, after the Closing to the extent necessary for any reasonable business
reasons, including, without limitation, disputing any indemnification claim,
the preparation of financial statements or Tax Returns, the defense of
litigation or Tax audits or compliance with other legal requirements.  
SECTION 5.11 Public Announcements. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that
no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance
(it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party).  
SECTION 5.12 Financing. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have at the Closing sufficient funds, including obtaining lines of credit or
other sources of immediately available funds, to enable Purchaser to pay, in
cash, the Purchase Price and all other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all related fees and expenses. Purchaser shall
keep Seller reasonably informed with respect to its efforts pursuant to this
SECTION 5.12, shall promptly notify Seller of any event which would
reasonably be expected to prevent Purchaser from having at the Closing
sufficient funds to enable its to pay the Purchase Price, and shall provide
all reasonably related information as requested by Seller. Compliance with
the foregoing shall not limit Purchaser\'s obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or its liability for the failure to do
so.   SECTION 5.13 Intellectual Property.   (a) Effective as of the
Closing Date, Seller hereby grants to the Company a license to use any
Trademarks containing the names "America Online," "AOL" or the AOL logo (the
"RETAINED NAMES") in a manner of a quality consistent with past practice
solely for use in the business of the Company consistent with past practice
and in each case as follows: (i) for 30 days only, for use on existing
Internet websites (provided that, if a domain name for an existing Internet
website is transferred from Seller to the Company prior to such time, then
such license shall terminate on the earlier of (A) five (5) business
days after Purchaser or the Company receives notice of such transfer or (B)
upon the expiration of such thirty (30) day period); and (ii)   
-33-    for ninety (90) days, for use on existing advertising and
promotional materials, inventory, business cards, stationery and similar
items and content. The foregoing license to the Company shall expire at the
end of such time period. Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall initiate, and the parties shall cooperate to cause, and Seller
shall use reasonable efforts to complete, the transfer from Seller to the
Company of all domain names and registrations held in the name of Seller and
containing Trademarks of the Company that are set forth on SECTION 3.18(C) of
the Disclosure Letter. To the extent there is a local presence requirement
for registration of a domain name in a jurisdiction, Seller shall have no
obligation to maintain registration for such domain names after one-hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date.   (b) Notwithstanding the
representations and warranties of Seller under SECTION 3.18(B), Purchaser
acknowledges that the Company uses certain software, information technology
and similar items pursuant to licenses that are (i) shared with other
businesses of Seller and its Affiliates and/or (ii) commercially available,
off the shelf software (collectively, the "RETAINED SOFTWARE"). SECTION
5.13(B) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all
Retained Software that is (A) required for the operation of, or (B) material
to and used in the operation of, the business of the Company as currently
conducted and Currently Contemplated To Be Conducted. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that, except as expressly provided in the Transition Services
Agreement, Purchaser and the Company shall have no right to use any Retained
Software after the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.14 Real Property.   (a) The
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to Purchaser or
an Affiliate of Purchaser the Real Property Lease set forth on SECTION
5.14(A) of the Disclosure Letter (the "ASSIGNED LEASE") and to obtain the
release of Seller and its Affiliates from any obligation with respect to such
Assigned Lease from and after the Closing.   (b) Except as set forth in this
SECTION 5.14, all employees of the Company shall cease using and vacate all
of Seller and its Affiliates\' other space from and after the Closing.  
SECTION 5.15 Financial Statements.   (a) Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and to cause its auditors to take such actions
as are necessary for the preparation of:   (i) if the Waiver (as defined
below) is granted by the Securities  and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), (A)
audited statements of net assets  to be acquired as of December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005 and audited  statements of revenues and direct expenses of
the Company for the fiscal  years ended December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004 and  all required footnotes thereto and (B) an
unaudited statement of net assets  to be acquired for the most recent fiscal
quarter(s) then ended before the  Closing as required by Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Securities    -34-     Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and an unaudited statement of revenues  and direct expenses of the
Company for the most recent fiscal quarter(s)  then ended and the year to
date information for the quarter then ended and  the corresponding prior
fiscal periods, before the Closing as required by  Regulation S-X, in each
case reviewed by the Company\'s independent  accountants in accordance with
Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100  ("SAS-100") and prepared in
accordance with the Waiver and the Accounting  Principles and Methodologies
and otherwise in a form consistent with  Purchaser\'s requirements for filing
such financial statements under  Regulation S-X, as such requirements are
modified by the Waiver  (collectively, the "NON-GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS");
or   (ii) if the Waiver is not granted by the SEC, (A) audited balance 
sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and 
audited statements of income, stockholders\' equity and comprehensive income 
(loss) and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal years ended December  31,
2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and all required  footnotes
thereto, and (B) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company for  the most
recent fiscal quarter(s) then ended before the Closing as required  by
Regulation S-X and (C) unaudited statements of income and cash flows of  the
Company for the most recent fiscal quarter(s) then ended and the year  to
date information for the quarter then ended and the corresponding prior 
fiscal periods, before the Closing as required by Regulation S-X, in each 
case reviewed by the Company\'s independent accountants in accordance with 
SAS-100 and prepared in accordance with GAAP and otherwise in a form 
consistent with Purchaser\'s requirements for filing such financial 
statements under Regulation S-X (collectively the "GAAP FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS"). With respect to the statements of stockholders\' equity and 
comprehensive income (loss) described above, changes in stockholders\' 
equity and changes in comprehensive income will be presented in the GAAP 
Financial Statements, either in a separate statement or in a note to such 
financial statements, as and if required by Regulation S-X.   (b) If
requested by Purchaser to do so, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its auditors to deliver any opinions or consents
necessary for Purchaser to file the GAAP Financial Statements and the Non-
GAAP Financial Statements with the SEC. Purchaser shall promptly prepare
and present to the SEC a request for, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain as promptly as possible, a waiver of the requirement under Rule
3-05 of Regulation S-X to allow Purchaser to file the Non-GAAP Financial
Statements in satisfaction of its obligation to file financial statements of
the Company under such rule (the "WAIVER").   (c) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 5.15, in the event Purchaser
reasonably determines, based upon the advice of its independent registered
public accountants, that additional financial statements of the Company are
required in order for Purchaser to comply with Regulation S-X, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to    -35-    prepare and to cause
its auditors to take such actions as are necessary for the preparation and
delivery of such additional financial statements.   SECTION 5.16 Account
Administration.   (a) Monies of the Company Received By Seller After
Closing. After the Closing Date, all payments and reimbursements made by any
third party in the name of or to Seller to the extent, in connection with,
arising out of or relating to the Company shall be held by Seller in trust
for the benefit of the Company, and, on or prior to the last Business Day of
the month following the month in which Seller received such payment or
reimbursement, Seller shall pay over to the Company the amount of such
payment or reimbursement. Except as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement or in SECTION 5.9(A), this SECTION 5.16(A) or SECTION 5.17, Seller
will in no event assist or provide services to Purchaser or the Company in
the administration or collection of any accounts receivable of the Company,
whether outstanding prior to, as of or after the Closing.   (b) Accounts
Payable of the Company. After the Closing Date, if Seller receives any
notices or invoices by any third party in connection with, arising out of or
relating to any accounts payable of the Company, then, promptly after receipt
by Seller of any such notice or invoice, Seller shall forward such notice or
invoice to the Company for payment by Purchaser or the Company. Except as set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement or in SECTION 5.9(A), this SECTION
5.16(B) or SECTION 5.17, Seller will in no event assist or provide services
to Purchaser or the Company in the payment or administration of any accounts
payable of the Company outstanding after the Closing.   SECTION 5.17
Integration Assistance Until the Closing Date. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Purchaser, in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with Seller\'s operations or business, to facilitate the orderly
transition of the Company\'s operations to Purchaser\'s payroll, billing,
accounts receivable and internal computing systems and networks, as
are reasonably required to operate the business of the Company at and after
the Closing as a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Purchaser without the
assistance, support or services of Seller. Purchaser will promptly reimburse
Seller for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in complying with
this Section 5.17, and Seller will not assume any risk or liability
associated with Purchaser\'s failure to successfully transition any of the
Company\'s operations so long as Seller has complied with its obligations in
this Section 5.17.   SECTION 5.18 Seattle Sublease. Prior to the Closing,
Seller will enter into a sublease with the Company with respect to the
Seattle Property, which sublease will be on the terms set forth on EXHIBIT
F.   ARTICLE VI  EMPLOYEE MATTERS   SECTION 6.1 Employee Matters.   
-36-     (a) (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser (or one of
its Affiliates): (1) shall continue to employ each Acquired Company Employee
and each Non-U.S. Employee; and (2) shall continue to employ (where
employment continues automatically by operation of Law) or offer employment
to (where employment does not continue automatically by operation of Law)
each Non-U.S. Service Provider. The Persons described in clauses (1) and (2)
shall include those Persons absent from work due to holiday, vacation,
injury, sick leave, disability, jury duty, military leave or other leave of
absence. Each Acquired Company Employee, each Non-U.S. Employee and each
Non-U.S. Service Provider who continues in employment or accepts an offer of
employment, as the case may be, shall be referred to herein as a "TRANSFERRED
EMPLOYEE." Except to the extent required by applicable Law, such continued
employment or offers of employment will be on an "at-will" basis and will be
contingent on the Closing. Except to the extent required by applicable Law,
and subject to SECTION 6.1(B) and SECTION 6.1(D)(II), Transferred Employees
will, upon Closing, become subject to Purchaser\'s standard sexual
harassment, business ethics, insider trading and disclosure policies and
procedures, copies of which have been provided to Seller prior to the date
hereof. With respect to Non-U.S. Service Providers, such offers of employment
may be conditioned upon the Non-U.S. Service Provider\'s provision of
evidence of legal right to work in such Non-U.S. Service Provider\'s current
country of service.   (ii) With respect to each Non-U.S. Employee and each
Non-U.S.  Service Provider, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, with the good
faith  assistance of Seller and the Company, take all actions required by 
applicable Law, including, where applicable, (A) submitting any filings to 
governmental agencies, (B) consulting with and providing any required 
notices to employees, service providers, labor organizations, works 
councils, European Works Councils or other employee representative bodies 
and (C) making compliant offers of employment at or prior to Closing, to 
effectuate a transfer of employment and employer substitution as of the 
Closing Date in accordance with applicable Law. In addition, Purchaser 
agrees to cooperate with Seller and the Company in good faith to take such 
further action before, on or after the Closing Date, to ensure that such 
transfers of employment are effected in a manner that does not result in  any
termination liabilities to Seller (including severance, vacation  accruals,
vacation bonuses, or "13th salary") and that does not result in a  suspension
or gap in benefit plan coverage or a reduction in compensation  or benefits.
Purchaser further agrees to take the specific actions set  forth on SECTION
6.1(A)(II) of the Disclosure Letter in respect of the  Non-U.S. Employees and
Non-U.S. Service Providers.   (iii) Purchaser hereby indemnifies Seller
(itself and also on  behalf of the Non-U.S. Service Provider\'s current
employer) and agrees to  hold Seller harmless against any and all Losses or
Liabilities arising out  of or resulting from, directly or indirectly, (A)
Purchaser\'s failure to  comply with this SECTION 6.1(A), including, without
limitation, Liabilities  and claims relating to alleged termination of
employment, breach of  contract, constructive discharge, failure to inform or
consult, non-payment  of remuneration, compensation or benefits, wrongful or
unlawful termination  or employee or employment-related rights, obligations
or Liabilities and  (B) any severance,    -37-     termination
indemnity, redundancy or any other similar or related payments,  costs,
benefits, compensation or Liabilities with respect to any Non-U.S.  Service
Provider who does not accept Purchaser\'s offer of employment or  whose
employment does not transfer to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates at 
Closing and therefore does not become a Transferred Employee.   (b) Without
limiting the provisions of SECTION 6.1(A) or any additional rights under any
Benefit Plan, as of the Closing Date and for a period of not less than twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates and the Company to, provide each Transferred Employee with base
salary, incentive compensation, bonus opportunities and employee benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) Purchaser shall not, during such twelve
(12) month period, reduce any Transferred Employee\'s rate of salary or wages
from that in effect immediately prior to Closing, and (ii) from and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates and the Company,
as applicable, to honor those employment, change in control, termination,
retention and severance agreements set forth in SECTION 6.1(B) of the
Disclosure Letter.   (c) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates and the Company to, provide each Transferred
Employee credit for all service with Seller, the Company and their Affiliates
(and service credited by any of them with any predecessor employer) for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under all employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements (other than equity incentive
compensation awards under stock incentive plans, such as stock options and
restricted stock units, but not retirement plans) in which the Transferred
Employees become participants on or after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. From and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates and the Company
to, as applicable, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any welfare benefit plans in
which such Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Closing Date and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid during the portion of the relevant plan year
prior to the Closing Date to satisfy any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans in which such
Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date.  
(d) (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Acquired Company Employees and
Non-U.S. Employees and Non-U.S. Service Providers shall cease to accrue any
further benefits under, and shall cease to participate as active participants
in, all Benefit Plans and all other compensation and benefit arrangements,
plans, policies or agreements sponsored, contributed to or maintained by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that are not maintained
exclusively by the Company (the "SELLER PLANS"). As of the Closing Date, the
Company shall cease to be a participating employer under the Seller Plans and
Seller shall retain    -38-    all assets and liabilities under, and
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall assume sole sponsorship of, the
Seller Plans.   (ii) Purchaser\'s and Seller\'s agreements with respect to
certain  bonus arrangements are set forth on SECTION 6.1(D)(II) of the
Disclosure  Letter.   (e) As of the Closing Date, except as otherwise
provided in SECTION 6.1(A)(III) and SECTION 6.1(D)(II), Seller shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless, Purchaser against any
liabilities or claims under the Seller Plans.   (f) Purchaser shall not
assume any options, warrants, stock appreciation, phantom stock, or other
similar rights or equity based awards with respect to any security of the
Company, Seller or any Affiliate thereof, and all such awards shall remain
the sole responsibility of Seller or any Affiliate thereof.   (g) Purchaser
(or, after the Closing, the Company) shall not, at any time prior to ninety
(90) days after the Closing, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff",
as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN"), affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee of Seller, without notifying
Seller in advance and without complying with the notice requirements and
other provisions of WARN. In addition, Purchaser (or, after the Closing,
the Company) shall provide a full defense to, and indemnify Seller for, any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including attorneys\' fees and
other costs of defense) which Seller may incur in connection with, any suit
or claim of violation brought against Seller under WARN for any actions taken
by Purchaser (or, after the Closing, the Company) with regard to any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee affected by this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.2 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This ARTICLE VI shall
inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be binding solely upon, the parties
to this Agreement and their respective successors, permitted assigns,
executors and legal representatives. Nothing in this ARTICLE VI, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any present or former employee, service provider or any such Person\'s
alternate payees, dependents or beneficiaries, whether in respect of
continued employment or resumed employment, compensation, employee benefits
or otherwise.   ARTICLE VII  TAX MATTERS   SECTION 7.1 Tax Returns;
Responsibility for Pre-Closing Taxes.   (a) Purchaser shall file, or cause
to be filed, all Tax Returns relating to the Company, other than those Tax
Returns (i) of the Company that are due on or prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) that are Consolidated or Combined Returns. With respect to Tax Returns
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date by or with respect to
the Company for any Tax period that commenced prior to and continues after
the Closing Date (such period, a "STRADDLE    -39-    PERIOD," and
such returns, "STRADDLE RETURNS"), such Straddle Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law).
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Straddle Return (including extensions) a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax allocated to Seller pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(C) (the "TAX STATEMENT") and copies of such Straddle Return.
Seller shall have the right to review such Straddle Return and the Tax
Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Return and, within ten (10)
days after the date of receipt by Seller of any Straddle Return, to request
in writing any reasonable changes to such Straddle Return. Seller and
Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of the review of such Straddle Return and the Tax Statement and
mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Straddle
Return. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten
(10) days after Purchaser has received Seller\'s written request for changes,
then any disputed issues shall be immediately submitted to a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm chosen by and mutually acceptable to
both Seller and Purchaser to resolve in a final binding matter prior to the
due date for such Straddle Return. The fees and expenses of such independent
accounting firm shall be shared equally between Seller and Purchaser.   (b)
Seller shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns referred to in
SECTION 7.1(A)(I) and SECTION 7.1(A)(II) and, to the extent that they
are required to be filed (without regard to extensions) on or before the
Closing Date, shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, which
Tax Returns shall be completed in accordance with applicable Law and
consistent with past practice. Neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall take
any position on any amended Tax Return relating to the Company or settle or
compromise any Action or audit, in each case that would have a material
adverse effect on Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company).   (c) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall
indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) harmless against any and all Losses for (i) any Income
Taxes (A) imposed on the Company with respect to any Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (the "PRE-CLOSING TAX PERIOD")
and (B) with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, of any other Person as a
result of Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, including any arrangement for group or consortium
relief or similar arrangement), as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise, and (ii) any Taxes of Wildseed or Transfer Taxes relating to the
transfer of Wildseed (or the transfer of assets to or from Wildseed). The
Income Taxes imposed upon the Company allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed as if such taxable period ended on the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions), other than
with respect to property placed in service after the Closing, shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.   SECTION 7.2
Refunds and Tax Benefits. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds,
credits or offsets of Taxes of the Company with respect to Taxes that are
paid by    -40-    Seller under SECTION 7.1(C) shall be for the account
of Seller. The amount or economic benefit of any other refunds, credits or
offsets of Taxes of the Company shall be for the account of Purchaser. Each
party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party
entitled to receive the amount or economic benefit of a refund, credit or
offset of Taxes the amount of such refund, or the economic benefit of such
credit or offset of Taxes, within ten (10) days after such refund is received
or after such credit or offset is allowed or applied against another Tax
liability, as the case may be.   SECTION 7.3 Carrybacks. To the extent
permitted by Law, Purchaser shall cause the Company to elect to relinquish
any carryback of net operating losses, net capital losses, unused tax credits
and other deductible or creditable tax attributes arising in a period
beginning after the Closing Date to a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Return for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.  
SECTION 7.4 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne solely by Purchaser (other than
as set forth in SECTION 7.1(C)(II) with respect to Wildseed). Purchaser shall
file, or shall cause to be filed, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax
Laws relating to Transfer Taxes.   SECTION 7.5 Tax Sharing Agreements. On or
prior to the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements between the Company, on
the one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the
other hand, shall be terminated, and, after the Closing, neither the Company,
Seller, Purchaser or any Affiliates of the foregoing shall be bound thereby
or have any obligations or Liability thereunder.   SECTION 7.6 Tax
Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made under this ARTICLE VII or ARTICLE IX as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and
the parties agree to, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file
their Tax Returns accordingly.   SECTION 7.7 Tax Cooperation. Purchaser and
its Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns with respect to the Company or its operations and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of or
attributable to the Company or its operations. Such cooperation shall include
retention and provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.   SECTION
7.8 Survival. The obligations set forth in this ARTICLE VII (and any claim
for breach thereof) shall terminate at the close of business on the thirtieth
(30th) day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof), and shall not be subject   
-41-    to any of the limitations on indemnification set forth in ARTICLE
IX hereof. In the event of any conflict between this ARTICLE VII and any
other provision of this Agreement (including Article IX), this ARTICLE VII
shall govern.   SECTION 7.9 Tax Contest.   (a) If a claim shall be made by
any Tax Authority, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to SECTION 7.1(C) or SECTION 9.2, then such
Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such claim and of any counterclaim the Indemnified Party proposes to assert
(a "TAX CLAIM"); provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (b) Except as set forth in SECTION 7.9(C) with respect to
Straddle Periods, with respect to any Tax Claim made prior to the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the date of this Agreement or relating to Income Taxes
of the Company, in each case for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a "SELLER
CONTROLLED TAX CLAIM"), Seller shall, solely at its own cost and expense,
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Seller Controlled Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences
with any Tax Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits
such refund suits or contest the Seller Controlled Tax Claim in any
permissible manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not settle
such Seller Controlled Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Purchaser,
and counsel of its own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in
all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Seller Controlled Tax Claim
if Purchaser reasonably determines that such Seller Controlled Tax Claim
could have a material adverse impact on the Taxes of the Company in a taxable
period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. Except as set
forth in SECTION 7.9(C) with respect to Straddle Periods, Purchaser shall
control all proceeding and make all decisions taken in connection with all
other Tax Claims.   (c) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly control and
participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim made
prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement or

thereto contained in SECTION 3.10(K)) shall be true and correct on and as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and
as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is made only
as of a specific date, in which event such representation and warranty shall
be true and correct as of such specified date), except where the failure of
any such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood and
agreed that, solely for the purposes of determining whether this condition
has been satisfied with respect to the representation and warranty set forth
in SECTION 3.18(H), the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall
be read to replace "Company" with "Purchaser").   (b) Seller shall have

though made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or
warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
specified date), except where the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Purchaser shall have performed in all material
respects and complied with in all material respects the obligations,
agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by it
under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.   (c) Seller shall

accordance with SECTION 9.2(C) prior to the expiration of the applicable
representation and warranty, then the relevant representation and warranty
shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been
finally resolved.   SECTION 9.2 Indemnification.    -44-     (a)
From and after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Seller from and against all
Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), interest, awards, judgments and
penalties actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter a "LOSS")
arising out of or resulting from:   (i) the breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller  in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII;  provided, however, that for purposes of
determining the amount of any Loss  incurred or sustained as a result of any
breach or inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty of the Company or
Seller (but not for purposes  of determining whether any such breach has
occurred), all exceptions in  such representation or warranty relating to
materiality and Company  Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded other
than such exceptions  contained in SECTION 3.10(K);   (ii) the breach of
any covenant or agreement by Seller contained  in this Agreement;   (iii)

foregoing provisions of this SECTION 9.2(A) shall not apply with respect
to any Losses arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be
available with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller that has expired as provided in SECTION 9.1.   (b) From and after
the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and permitted assigns shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Purchaser for any and all Losses arising out of or resulting
from:   (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by  Purchaser
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to  ARTICLE
VIII;   (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser 
contained in this Agreement; or   (iii) any Liabilities of the Company after
the Closing other than  as specifically contemplated by this Agreement to be
the responsibility of  Seller or which otherwise constitutes a Loss for which
Purchaser is  entitled to indemnification hereunder.  The foregoing
provisions of this SECTION 9.2(B) shall not apply with respect to any Losses
arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be available with
respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
that has expired as provided in SECTION 9.1.    -45-     (c) Any party
seeking indemnification under SECTION 9.2(A) or SECTION 9.2(B) (an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") (except with respect to Tax Claims, which shall be
governed exclusively by ARTICLE VII) shall promptly give the party from
whom indemnification is being sought (an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") notice (a
"CLAIM NOTICE") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has
given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement
within sixty (60) days of such determination, stating in reasonable detail,
the nature of the claim, a good-faith reasonable estimate of the Loss and
method of computation thereof and a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for indemnification
(including any Third-Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute.
If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such
dispute in thirty (30) days after the commencement of such negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of law.  
(d) Except with respect to Tax Claims (which shall be governed exclusively by
ARTICLE VII), the obligations and Liabilities of an Indemnifying Party under
SECTION 9.2 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in SECTION 9.2
(a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") shall be governed by and contingent upon the
following additional terms and conditions:   (i) If an Indemnified Party
shall receive notice of any Third  Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice  of such Third Party Claim within thirty
(30) days of the receipt by the  Indemnified Party of such notice and a copy
of the papers served with  respect to such claim (if any); provided, however,
that the failure to  provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of  its obligations under SECTION 9.2, except to the extent
the Indemnifying  Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. At its
election, the  Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to jointly participate in
the defense  of such Third Party Claim with the Indemnified Party if the
Indemnifying  Party gives notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to
join in the  participation of the defense of such Third Party Claim within
the earlier  of (i) ninety (90) calendar days of delivery of the Claim Notice
and (ii)  ten (10) Business Days following delivery of written notice from
the  Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party
has  reasonably and in good faith, based on the advice of outside counsel, 
determined that the Indemnified Party\'s ability to successfully prosecute 
such litigation would be materially prejudiced by the failure to make such 
election to join prior to expiration of the ninety (90) day period referred 
to in the immediately preceding clause (i); provided that the Indemnified 
Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to all relevant 
witnesses, records, materials and information in order to determine whether 
to exercise such right. In the event the Indemnifying Party exercises the 
right to join with the Indemnified Party in any such defense against any 
such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party and the 
Indemnifying Party shall (i) consult and cooperate with each other in such 
defense and in all strategic, tactical and other significant actions and 
decisions relating thereto (and shall not take any material actions   
-46-     or decisions without the consent of the other party), (ii) both
be  considered to be engaged in a client relationship with the counsel
acting  in the defense of such Third Party Claim and (iii) shall make
available to  each other all witnesses, records, materials and information in
such  party\'s possession or under such party\'s control relating thereto as
is  reasonably required to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim. 
Counsel for such defense shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the 
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and both the Indemnifying  Party
and the Indemnified Party shall share an attorney-client relationship  with
such counsel.   (ii) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
join  in the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms hereof,
the  Indemnified Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
assume  and control the defense of such Third Party Claim without relieving
the  Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations to indemnify the
Indemnified  Party pursuant and subject to this ARTICLE IX for Losses
incurred in  connection with such Third Party Claim (including the cost of
the defense  thereof).   (iii) In the event the Indemnifying Party elects
to join in the  defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms
hereof:   (A) The Indemnified Party shall have the right, in its sole 
discretion at any time and without the consent of the Indemnifying  Party, to
settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim or consent  to the entry of
any judgment in respect of such Third Party Claim if:  (I) after giving
effect to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE  IX based on the
indemnified Losses to date, the amount of such  settlement, judgment or
compromise (including the cost of defending  against such Third Party Claim)
would be borne more by the Indemnified  Party than the Indemnifying Party;
(II) such settlement, compromise or  judgment includes as an unconditional
term thereof the delivery by the  claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnifying
Party of a written release  from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim; (III) in the  case of a settlement, such settlement does not contain
any admission  of fault by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party; and (IV)
such  settlement, compromise or judgment does not contain any non-monetary 
relief imposed upon the Indemnifying Party.   (B) The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, in its sole  discretion at any time and without the
consent of the Indemnified  Party, to cause the Indemnified Party to settle
or compromise such  Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
in respect  of such Third Party Claim if: (I) after giving effect to the 
limitations set forth in this ARTICLE IX based on the indemnified  Losses to
date, (x) the amount of such settlement, judgment or  compromise (including
the cost of defending against such Third Party  Claim) would be borne more by
the Indemnifying Party than the  Indemnified Party, (y) such amount does not
exceed the Cap and (z) the  amount payable by the Indemnified Party does
not    -47-     exceed the then-remaining portion of the Basket; (II)
such settlement,  compromise or judgment includes as an unconditional term
thereof the  delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party
of a  written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party 
Claim; (III) in the case of a settlement, such settlement does not  contain
any admission of fault by or on behalf of the Indemnified  Party; and (IV)
such settlement, compromise or judgment does not  contain any non-monetary
relief imposed upon the Indemnified Party.   (C) In all cases not described
in the foregoing clauses (A) and  (B), any settlement or compromise of, or
consent to judgment in, any  such Third Party Claim shall require the mutual
consent of the  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.   SECTION 9.3

amount equal to $25,000,000 (the "MAXIMUM AMOUNT"); provided that no such
limitation shall apply in respect of Losses arising out of (i) breaches of

loss of business reputation or opportunity or any damages measure determined
by diminution in value or the application of a multiple to any financial or

extent of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from any
third party (including insurance proceeds) in respect of an indemnifiable

to pursue payment under or from any insurer or third party in respect of such
Losses prior to pursuing payment from any Indemnifying Party.   SECTION 9.5
Access. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice by any Indemnified
Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives all reasonable access to the books, records, employees and

been, however, included in the Disclosure Letter (and may be included
elsewhere in this Agreement) items which are not "material" within the
meaning of the immediately preceding sentence in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be
an acknowledgement by Seller that such items are "material" and shall not be
used to define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement.
Disclosures included in any Section of the Disclosure Letter shall be
considered to be made for purposes of all other Sections of the Disclosure
Letter to the    -51-    extent that the relevance of any such

enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
of the United States of America located in the State of New York, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto agrees that any Action
