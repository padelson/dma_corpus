uncertificated share shall represent only the right to receive (x) the Splitco
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Splitco Common
Stock  represented by such Splitco Certificate or uncertificated share
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, (y) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (z) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such

of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and
to the extent that any holder of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock
would otherwise be  entitled to receive a fractional share of Holdings Common
Stock, no such fractional shares will be issued to such holder as a result of
the Splitco Merger or DIRECTV Merger and no such holder shall be entitled to
vote or to any rights of a holder of Holdings Common Stock with respect to
fractional shares such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. For
purposes of this Section 2.1(c), all fractional share interests to which each
record holder would be entitled will be  aggregated and sold by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(ii).

  

(ii) Fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock that would otherwise
be allocable to any former holders of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common
Stock in the Mergers will be aggregated, and the Exchange Agent shall sell the
aggregate shares in the public market. The Exchange Agent will make available
the net  proceeds thereof, after deducting any required withholding Taxes and
brokerage charges, commissions and transfer Taxes, on a pro rata basis,
without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of Splitco Common
Stock, DIRECTV Common Stock or the Malone Splitco Shares, as applicable,
entitled to receive such cash. No interest shall accrue on any cash payable

Splitco Common Stock receiving shares of Holdings Common Stock in the Malone
Contribution will be determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Malone Agreement.

  

(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. So as to maintain the relative
proportionate interests of the holders of the Splitco Common Stock and the
DIRECTV Common Stock in Holdings Common Stock immediately following the Merger
Effective Time intended by this Agreement as of the date hereof, the  Splitco
Exchange Ratio, the Splitco Merger Consideration, the DIRECTV Exchange Ratio
and the DIRECTV Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the

Entertainment Common Stock, Splitco Common Stock or Holdings Common Stock or

the Malone Contribution, through the Exchange Agent, certificates (or evidence
of shares in book-entry form) representing the shares of Holdings Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Splitco

(such shares of  Holdings Common Stock, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Merger
Effective Time and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of
Holdings Common Stock received by the Exchange Agent through sales
contemplated by Section 2.1(c), being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Merger Effective Time,
and in any event no later than ten Business Days after the Merger Effective
Time, Holdings shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which 
immediately prior to the DIRECTV Effective Time or the Merger Effective Time,
as applicable, represented outstanding shares of DIRECTV Common Stock (other
than the Liberty DIRECTV Shares) (the " _DIRECTV Certificates_ ") or of
Splitco Common Stock (other than the Malone Splitco Shares) (the " _Splitco

Merger Consideration or the Splitco Merger Consideration, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the  Certificates to the Exchange

Agent, and which shall be in customary form and shall have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Holdings
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates (or evidence of
shares in book-entry  form) representing, as applicable, the DIRECTV Merger
Consideration or the Splitco Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdings Common
Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly  executed in
accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing that number of whole
shares of Holdings Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all
the shares of Splitco  Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock then held by such
holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (B) any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and
(C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV  Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of Splitco or DIRECTV, as applicable, a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing the proper
number of shares of Holdings Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if,
upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person 
requesting such issuance shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Holdings Common Stock to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Splitco Surviving Corporation or DIRECTV
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, that such tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each
Certificate shall  be deemed at any time after the DIRECTV Effective Time or
the Merger Effective Time, as applicable, to represent only the right to
receive as applicable, the DIRECTV Merger Consideration or the Splitco Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of
such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case,  without interest.

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Holdings Common Stock with a record
date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Holdings Common 
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Holdings
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in
each case until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any
Certificate in accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the
record holder thereof, without interest, (i)  promptly following the time of
such surrender, the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
Holdings Common Stock to which such holder is

  



        

     |

entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions, payable with respect to that number of whole shares of Holdings
Common Stock issuable in exchange for such Certificate pursuant to this
Article II, with a record date after the Merger Effective Time and paid with
respect to Holdings Common Stock prior to such surrender, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the  amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Holdings Common Stock.

Holdings Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any dividends or
other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash paid in lieu  of
any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c)) shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates, and at the DIRECTV Effective Time and the Merger Effective Time,
as applicable, the stock transfer books of DIRECTV and Splitco shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer  books of (x) the DIRECTV Surviving Corporation of the shares
of DIRECTV Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the DIRECTV
Effective Time (except for the Liberty DIRECTV Shares, which are to remain
issued and outstanding and are not affected by the DIRECTV Merger) and (y) the
Splitco Surviving Corporation of the shares of Splitco Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. Except as required
by applicable Law, from and after  the DIRECTV Effective Time and the Merger
Effective Time, as applicable the holders of Certificates that evidenced
ownership of shares of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the DIRECTV Effective Time or the Merger
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(f), if, at any time after the
DIRECTV Effective Time or the Merger Effective Time, as applicable,
Certificates  are presented to the Splitco Surviving Corporation, the DIRECTV
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Holdings, the posting by such Person of a bond,  in such
reasonable amount as Holdings may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, as
applicable, the DIRECTV Merger Consideration or Splitco Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share interests  of Holdings Common Stock to which such holder
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case pursuant to this
Agreement.

  

(f) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for sixty (60)
calendar days after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdings,
upon demand by Holdings, and any holders of Certificates who have not 
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Holdings for payment of their claim for (i) the DIRECTV Merger Consideration
or the Splitco

Merger Consideration, as applicable, (ii) any dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Holdings Common Stock and (iii) cash in lieu of any
fractional share interests of Holdings Common Stock in accordance with this
Article II. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or
other distributions  payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c)) would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.1(c)) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Holdings, free and clear of all claims  or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Splitco Surviving Corporation,
the DIRECTV Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any shares of Holdings Common Stock (or  dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Holdings Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund received through the public market
aggregated sales of fractional share interests effectuated in accordance with
the Exchange Agreement as directed by Holdings. Any interest and other 
income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be
paid to, Holdings.

  

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Holdings and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of shares of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and  withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, Holdings and
the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though they withheld from the type of
consideration from which withholding is required, an appropriate amount
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV  Common Stock in order to provide for such
withholding obligation and such withheld amounts shall be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
shares of Splitco Common Stock or DIRECTV Common Stock.

Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to those holders (other than Dr. Malone, Mrs. Leslie Malone, The Tracy L.
Neal Trust A, The Evan D. Malone Trust A and their respective Affiliates) of
shares of Liberty Entertainment Common Stock who receive shares of Splitco
Common Stock as a result of the Redemption (as defined in the Liberty Fairness

Subsidiaries or under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Splitco Material Contract to which Splitco or any of  its Subsidiaries is a

and any filings made with the IRS in connection therewith, and (y) where the

of Splitco unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement

be discovered by Liberty or DIRECTV which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Liberty Proxy Statement, so that such document would not

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which 
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated

     |  



    
    

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Merger Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX,
each of Liberty and Splitco shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and their Representatives (the " _Liberty and Splitco 
Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Splitco Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Splitco
Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement,
arrangement  or other understanding related to any Splitco Takeover Proposal,

     |  

56

      



  

any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
Liberty's or Splitco's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by a Splitco Takeover Proposal (and, to the
extent permitted thereunder, Liberty and Splitco shall promptly take all steps
necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to
any Person  other than DIRECTV, under any such provisions), or (v) resolve,
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided, however_ , that if (A)
after the date hereof, the Board of Directors of Liberty receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Splitco Takeover Proposal in circumstances not
involving a breach of this Agreement and (B) the Board of Directors of Liberty
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal  counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Splitco
Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Splitco Superior Proposal, then Liberty may, at any time prior to obtaining
the Liberty Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Liberty
Stockholder Approval) and after providing DIRECTV not less than forty-eight
(48) hours written notice of its intention to take such actions, (x) furnish
information with  respect to Liberty or the Splitco Business to the Person
making such Splitco Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into
a customary confidentiality agreement with Liberty (which confidentiality
agreement must be no less favorable to Liberty (i.e., no less restrictive with
respect to the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement),
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision
calling for an exclusive right to negotiate  with Liberty and may not
restrict Liberty from complying with this Section 6.4, and (2) Liberty advises
DIRECTV of all such non-public information delivered to such Person
concurrently with its delivery to such Person and concurrently with its
delivery to such Person, Liberty delivers to DIRECTV all such information not
previously provided to DIRECTV, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person regarding such Splitco Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the  foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by Liberty's Subsidiaries, Splitco's Subsidiaries,
Liberty's Representatives or Splitco's Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.4 by Liberty if such violation occurs prior to the
Split-Off Effective Time. Liberty shall provide DIRECTV with a correct and
complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this
paragraph within twenty-four  (24) hours of the execution thereof.

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of Liberty set forth in this
Section 6.4, Liberty shall promptly advise DIRECTV, orally and in writing, and
in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if any proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested
from, or any discussions or  negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, Liberty in respect of any Splitco Takeover Proposal, and
shall, in any such notice to DIRECTV, indicate (i) the identity of the Person
making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and (ii) the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such  proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep DIRECTV fully informed
of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and Liberty shall provide DIRECTV
with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4(c), neither the
Board of Directors of Liberty nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
DIRECTV, the Liberty Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors  of the Reorganization Agreement and
the Transactions (including the Mergers and the Split-Off) or (B) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Splitco Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Liberty Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize Liberty,
Splitco or any  of their respective Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to
any Splitco Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with Section 6.4(a) each, a " _Splitco Acquisition Agreement_ "),
or (iii) recommend a Splitco Takeover Proposal to the Liberty  Entertainment
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing (provided that Liberty has not
breached this Section 6.4 and at any time prior to obtaining the Liberty
Stockholder Approval, but in no event after obtaining the Liberty Stockholder
Approval), the Board of Directors of Liberty may effect a Liberty Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Splitco Takeover Proposal if it
determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of  nationally recognized reputation, that such Splitco
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Splitco Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided that no such action may be taken until after the
third Business Day following DIRECTV's receipt of written notice (unless at
the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
three Business Days prior to the Liberty  Stockholders Meeting, in which case
Liberty shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable) from
Liberty (a " _Liberty Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") advising DIRECTV that
Liberty has received a Splitco Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of
Liberty intends to make such Liberty Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying the terms and conditions of such Splitco Superior Proposal (it
being understood  and agreed that during such three Business Day period,
Liberty shall negotiate in good faith with DIRECTV and that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms of such Splitco Superior Proposal
shall require a new Liberty Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three
Business Day period (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to
be given there are less than three Business Days prior to the Liberty
Stockholders Meeting, in which case Liberty shall  provide as much notice as
is reasonably practicable)). In determining whether to make a Liberty Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of Liberty shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by DIRECTV (in
response to a Liberty Adverse Recommendation Notice or otherwise) in
determining whether such third party Splitco Takeover Proposal still
constitutes a Splitco Superior Proposal.

DIRECTV Shares) or (iii) all of the Liberty Owned DIRECTV Shares, made by a

terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of Liberty determines in its
good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of national reputation) to be more  favorable to the
stockholders of Liberty from a financial point of view than the Transactions,
taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of
this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by DIRECTV and the
ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other things, the
availability of financing, the expected timing of closing and the expectation
of obtaining required  approvals).

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of Liberty or Splitco from taking and disclosing to holders of Liberty Common

violation of applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
Liberty, Splitco, or their respective Boards of Directors or any committee
thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section
6.4(c).

timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and
of any material communication received or given in connection with any 
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of
the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any  Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions. Subject to Sections 6.6(c) and 6.14(b), no party hereto shall
independently participate in any formal or informal meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any material communication or any
filings, submissions, investigations or other inquiry, without giving the
other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or 
participate.

  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 6.6, each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by the FCC, or any other Governmental Authority or other Person with
respect to the Transactions. In seeking the  Requisite FCC Approvals, Liberty
and DIRECTV shall commit to accept program access and carriage conditions in
the form set forth in _Exhibit C_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, neither DIRECTV nor Splitco (nor Liberty on
behalf of Splitco) shall, without the other party's prior written consent,
commit to any further divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on
its business, and  nothing in this Section 6.6 shall (i) limit any applicable
rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 so
long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.6, (ii) require any party to offer, accept or
agree to (A) dispose or hold separate (in trust or otherwise) any part of its
businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of DIRECTV's
and Splitco's respective  businesses, operations, assets or product lines) or
otherwise rearrange the composition of its assets, (B) not compete in any
geographic area or line of business, (C) restrict the manner in which, or
whether, any party may carry on business in any part of the world (including
such party's freedom of action with respect to future acquisitions of assets
or businesses or its full rights of ownership with respect to any assets and
businesses held

as of the date hereof or at the Closing) and/or (D) take any action to impose
restrictions or limitations upon the exercise of full rights of ownership by
any holder of capital stock of Liberty, DIRECTV, Splitco or Holdings, or
otherwise to require the repurchase, redemption, deemed transfer, divestiture
or other disposition (by forced sale or otherwise) of the capital stock held
by any holder of shares  of Liberty, DIRECTV, Splitco or Holdings, or (iii)
require any party to this Agreement to contest or otherwise resist any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Law, beyond the requirements set forth in _Exhibit C_.

  

(f) (i) At the Split-Off Effective Time, Liberty shall assign
those of its rights under the Share Exchange Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements set forth in _Section 6.6(f) of the Liberty Disclosure
Schedule_ to Splitco or  one of its Subsidiaries (to the extent that Splitco
or one of its Subsidiaries is not a party to any such agreement).

  

(ii) From and after the date hereof until the first to occur of the
Merger Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, DIRECTV, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, covenants and agrees
that it will not initiate, join in or otherwise support any claim (including
derivative  claims), suit, action, arbitration or other legal, equitable or
other proceeding seeking (directly or indirectly) relief of any kind (in money
damages or equitable remedies) against Liberty or Splitco, their respective
Subsidiaries, or their respective Representatives (collectively, the "
_Liberty/Splitco Releasees_ ") pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement,
dated as of February 27, 2008, by and among DIRECTV, News and  Liberty (the "
_Indemnification Agreement_ "), that arises as a result of or in connection
with the Transactions. The foregoing covenant not to sue shall be applicable
to and shall constitute a release of any and all claims and liabilities that
may have arisen or may arise from all claims, actions or causes of action
against any of the Liberty/Splitco Releasees which DIRECTV and its Affiliates
have or purport to have based  on the Indemnification Agreement and that
arises as a result of or in connection with the Transactions.

  

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (ii),
from and after the Split-Off Effective Time, DIRECTV, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, covenants and agrees that it will not initiate, join in or
otherwise support any claim (including derivative claims), suit, action,
arbitration or other legal,  equitable or other proceeding seeking (directly
or indirectly) relief of any kind (in money damages or equitable remedies)
against Liberty or its Subsidiaries or its Representatives (the " _Liberty
Releasees_ ") pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement. The foregoing
covenant not to sue shall be applicable to and shall constitute a release of
any and all claims and liabilities that may have arisen or may arise from
all  claims, actions or causes of action against any of the Liberty Releasees
which DIRECTV and its Affiliates have or purport to have based on the
Indemnification Agreement.

  

(iv) At the Split-Off Effective Time, the letter agreement, dated May
6, 2008 (the " _May 2008 Letter_ "), among DIRECTV, Liberty and the other
parties named therein shall be of no further force and effect as to Liberty; 
_provided_ that all of the rights and obligations of Liberty under the May
2008 Letter shall be assumed by Splitco.

(g) In connection with the Split-Off, Liberty and Splitco shall use
their reasonable best efforts to seek, as promptly as practicable, a private
letter ruling from the IRS, to the effect that the LDIG Gamenet Restructuring,
the Contribution and the Split-Off (each to be consummated in accordance with
the Reorganization Agreement and, in  respect of the Split-Off, in accordance
with paragraph (f)(i) of Article IV, Section A.2 of the certificate of
incorporation of Liberty) will qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections
355 and/or 368 of the Code and such other rulings as are set forth on _Section
6.6(g) of the Liberty Disclosure Schedule_ (such ruling, the " _IRS Ruling_
");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the IRS will not issue
one or more of the rulings requested by Liberty, then Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings and DIRECTV shall use their reasonable best efforts to restructure
the transactions in a manner that will preserve the economics and equity
participation of the transactions to Liberty, DIRECTV, Splitco and their
respective stockholders  and result in the receipt of such rulings.

  

(h) Each of Liberty and Splitco shall use, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain at the earliest
practicable date all of the consents, waivers and approvals listed on _Section
6.6(h) of the Liberty Disclosure Schedule_. All such consents, waivers, 
approvals and notices shall be in writing and in form and substance
satisfactory to DIRECTV, and executed counterparts of such consents, waivers
and approvals shall be delivered to DIRECTV promptly after receipt thereof,
and copies of such notices shall be delivered to DIRECTV promptly after the
making thereof.

  

SECTION 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by DIRECTV and Liberty. Thereafter, none of Liberty,
Splitco nor DIRECTV shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other written communication to the public (to  the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Mergers,
this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consent of the other
parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party, to the
extent  such party is reasonably able to do so, shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party).

  

SECTION 6.8 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Prior to the Closing,
with respect to the Splitco Business only, Liberty and Splitco shall, and
shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, afford to DIRECTV and DIRECTV's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all of their
properties, commitments, books, Contracts,  records and correspondence (in
each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives as DIRECTV
may reasonably request with reasonable prior notice and Liberty and Splitco
shall furnish as soon as reasonably practicable to DIRECTV all information
concerning the Splitco Business as DIRECTV may reasonably request, subject in
all cases, to any bona fide concerns of attorney-client privilege that 
Liberty and Splitco may reasonably have and any restrictions contained in
Contracts to which Liberty, Splitco or any of their Subsidiaries is a party
(it being understood that each of Liberty and Splitco shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide any such information in a manner that does not result
in such violation). DIRECTV and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business of
Liberty, Splitco or any 

  



        

     |  

66

      



  

of their Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with
the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of Liberty, Splitco or any of
their respective Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Except for disclosures
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September
15, 2008, between Liberty and DIRECTV (as it may be amended from time to time,
including to add  Splitco as a party thereto, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), DIRECTV shall hold information received from Liberty pursuant
to this Section in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation, or information received, pursuant
to this Section 6.8 will modify any of the representations and warranties of
the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Liberty and Splitco shall
give prompt notice to DIRECTV, and DIRECTV shall give prompt notice to Liberty
and Splitco, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such  Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to
Liberty (solely with respect to the Splitco Business, the Liberty Owned
DIRECTV Shares or the Transactions), Splitco, Holdings, or DIRECTV, (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or  otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained
in this Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect to be untrue and (B) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any
material respect, and (iv)  any material failure of such party to comply with
or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.9 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice.

        

SECTION 6.10

     |  

_Indemnification_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) From and after the DIRECTV Effective Time, Holdings shall indemnify
the individuals who at or prior to the DIRECTV Effective Time were directors
or officers of DIRECTV with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the DIRECTV Effective Time, to the
fullest extent (i) required by the  DIRECTV Charter Documents as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, (ii) required by any indemnification agreement
between DIRECTV and any such director or officer as in effect on the date
hereof or as of the DIRECTV Effective Time or (iii) permitted under applicable
Law.

  

(b) From and after the Merger Effective Time, Holdings shall indemnify
the individuals who at or prior to the Merger Effective Time were directors or
officers of Liberty or Splitco with respect to third party Actions brought by
stockholders of Liberty Entertainment Common Stock or, after the Split-Off
Effective Time, Splitco Common Stock,  for acts taken or omissions by them in
their capacities as directors or officers of Liberty or Splitco in connection
with the approval of the Transactions, including the Split-Off and the
Mergers, at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than claims
brought relating to the percentage of Liberty

  



        

     |  

67

      



  

Entertainment Common Stock excluded from the Redemption), to the fullest
extent (A) required by the Liberty Charter Documents as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, (B) required by the Splitco Public Charter Documents as in
effect upon the Split-Off Effective Time, (C) required by any indemnification
agreement (x) between Liberty and any such director or officer as in effect on
the date hereof (or  entered into after the date hereof) and in the form
publicly filed by Liberty prior to the date hereof, or (y) between Splitco and
any such director or officer entered into after the date hereof and in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , and (D) permitted under applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the foregoing
indemnification obligations shall only apply to Losses relating to Actions by
holders of  Liberty Entertainment Common Stock regardless of whether such
holders own other classes of Liberty Media Common Stock and to Losses relating
to Actions by holders of Splitco Common Stock.

  

(c) The directors and officers of DIRECTV, Liberty and Splitco to whom
this Section 6.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.10. The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of each director and officer of DIRECTV, Liberty and Splitco and his or her
heirs.

        

(d)

    
--- 
    

(i) In connection with any indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.10, the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnitee_ ") will
give Holdings (for purposes of this section, the  " _Indemnitor_ ") prompt
notice whenever it comes to the attention of the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitee has suffered or incurred, or may suffer or incur, any Losses for
which it is entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.10, and, if and
when known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the projected
amount of such Losses (in each case, in reasonable detail). Without limiting
the generality of the  foregoing, in the case of any Action made or commenced
by a third party for which indemnification is being sought (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such notice will be given no later than ten business days following
receipt by the Indemnitee of written notice of such Third-Party Claim. The
failure by any Indemnitee to so notify the applicable Indemnitor will not
relieve such Indemnitor of any Liability under this Agreement except  to the
extent that such failure prejudices such Indemnitor in any material respect.
The Indemnitee will deliver to the Indemnitor as promptly as practicable, and
in any event within five business days after Indemnitee's receipt, copies of
all notices, court papers and other documents received by the Indemnitee
relating to any Third-Party Claim.

  

(ii) After receipt of a notice pursuant to Section 6.10(d)(i) with
respect to any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor will be entitled, if it so
elects, to take control of the defense and investigation with respect to such
Third-Party Claim and to employ and engage attorneys reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnitee  to handle and defend such claim, at the Indemnitor's cost,
risk and expense, upon written notice to the Indemnitee of such election. The
Indemnitor will not settle any Third-Party Claim that is the subject of
indemnification without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however,
that, after reasonable notice, the Indemnitor may settle a claim without the
Indemnitee's consent if such  settlement (A) makes no admission or
acknowledgment of Liability or culpability with

  



        

     |  

68

      



  

respect to the Indemnitee, (B) includes a complete release of the Indemnitee
and (C) does not seek any relief against the Indemnitee other than the payment
of money damages to be borne by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee will cooperate
in all reasonable respects with the Indemnitor and its attorneys in the
investigation, trial and defense of any lawsuit or action with respect to
such  claim and any appeal arising therefrom (including the filing in the
Indemnitee's name of appropriate cross-claims and counterclaims). The
Indemnitee may, at its own cost, participate in any investigation, trial and
defense of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnitor and any appeal
arising therefrom, including participating in the process with respect to the
potential settlement or compromise thereof. If Indemnitee has been advised by
its counsel that there may be one  or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnitee that conflict with those available to, or that are not available
to, the Indemnitor (" _Separate Legal Defenses_ "), or that there may be
actual or potential differing or conflicting interests between the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnitee will have the right, at the expense of the Indemnitor, to
engage  separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, and the
Indemnitor will not have the right to control the defense or investigation of
such Separate Legal Defenses available to such Indemnitee.

  

(iii) If, after receipt of a notice pursuant to Section 6.10(d)(i), the
Indemnitor does not undertake to defend any such claim within thirty (30) days
of receipt of such notice, the Indemnitee may, but will have no obligation to,
contest any lawsuit or action with respect to such claim, and the Indemnitor
will be bound  by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnitee.
The Indemnitee may not settle any lawsuit or action with respect to which the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless the Indemnitor had the right under this Section 6.10 to
undertake control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim and failed to do so
within thirty (30) days of receipt of  such notice.

        

SECTION 6.11

     |  

_Restructuring and Split-Off_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) Liberty and Splitco agree to execute and deliver the Reorganization
Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement and the Services Agreement, each in the
forms attached hereto, prior to the Split-Off Effective Time.

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.4, Liberty and Splitco shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use their respective reasonable best efforts, (i) to complete the
Restructuring, prior to the Split-Off Effective Time, on and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Reorganization Agreement,  (ii) to execute and
deliver the other Restructuring Agreements at or prior to the Split-Off
Effective Time and (iii) to effect the Split-Off at or prior to the Closing in
accordance with paragraph (f)(i) of Article IV, Section A.2 of the certificate
of incorporation of Liberty and the Reorganization Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, each of Liberty and Splitco shall not, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and the other parties to the Transaction Agreements not to,
amend, modify,  terminate or abandon any of the Transaction Agreements (other
than this Agreement) or the Letter Agreement or to agree to amend, modify,
terminate or abandon the Restructuring or any agreement or instrument entered

  



        

     |  

69

      



  

into in accordance therewith or to waive any term or condition applicable
thereto without the prior written consent of DIRECTV.

  

(c) Liberty and Splitco agree not to consummate the Split-Off until the
first to occur of (i) all conditions to Closing contained in this Agreement,
other than the condition that the Split-Off shall have occurred and conditions
that may only be satisfied at Closing, shall have been satisfied or, to the
extent permitted under the terms  hereof, waived and the parties hereto shall
have confirmed that the Closing will occur subject only to the Split-Off and
the satisfaction of the conditions that may only be satisfied at Closing, (ii)
the termination of this Agreement or (iii) the Board of Directors of Liberty
shall have determined that the conditions to the Split-Off set forth in the
Reorganization Agreement (other than those conditions that may only be
satisfied upon the closing of the Restructuring) have been  satisfied, that
the conditions to the Mergers set forth herein (other than those conditions
that may only be satisfied upon the closing of the Mergers) have not yet been
satisfied, and that the Split-Off shall occur in advance of the Mergers on the
date and time specified by the Board of Directors of Liberty in accordance
with the Reorganization Agreement and in accordance with paragraph (f)(i) of
Article IV, Section A.2 of the certificate of incorporation of Liberty.

  

(d) At the Split-Off Effective Time, the Splitco Charter and the
Splitco Bylaws shall be amended so as to read in their entirety in the forms
set forth in _Exhibit A-3_ and _Exhibit A-4_ , respectively (collectively,
the  " _Splitco Public Charter Documents_ ").

  

SECTION 6.12 _Defense of Litigation_. Each of Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two and DIRECTV shall use its reasonable
best efforts to defend against all actions, suits or proceedings in which such
party is named as a defendant that challenge or otherwise seek to  enjoin,
restrain or prohibit the Transactions. None of Liberty, Splitco, Holdings,
Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or DIRECTV shall settle any such action, suit
or proceeding or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any
judgment rendered or order entered against such party therein without having
previously consulted with the other parties. Each of Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two and DIRECTV shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of  its Affiliates, directors and officers to use
reasonable best efforts to defend any such action, suit or proceeding in which
such Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks
any such relief to comply with this Section 6.12 to the same extent as if such
Person was a party.

  

SECTION 6.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 9.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, each other
Transaction Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the  Mergers are consummated; _provided_ that Liberty shall be responsible
for paying all fees and expenses incurred by Liberty and Splitco in connection
with this Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement, the Mergers and the
consummation of the Transactions and DIRECTV shall be responsible for paying
all fees and expenses incurred by DIRECTV, Holdings, Merger Sub One and Merger
Sub Two. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained herein, DIRECTV
will pay for the portion of the SEC filing fee applicable to the Holdings Form
S-4 which is attributable to the shares of Holdings Common Stock to be
distributed to the holders of DIRECTV Common Stock in the DIRECTV Merger,
Splitco will pay (a) for the portion of the SEC filing fee applicable to the
Holdings Form S-4 which is

  



        

     |  

70

      



  

attributable to the shares of Holdings Common Stock to be distributed (i) to
the holders of Splitco Common Stock in the Splitco Merger and (ii) in
connection with the Malone Contribution and (b) Liberty will pay the entire
SEC filing fee applicable to the Splitco Form S-4.

        

SECTION 6.14

     |  

_Tax Matters_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) None of Splitco, DIRECTV or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall, and prior to the Split-Off Effective Time, none of Liberty or any of
its Subsidiaries shall, take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken, which action or
failure to act could reasonably be expected  to cause (i) the LDIG Gamenet
Restructuring to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the
Code, (ii) the Contribution and the Split-Off to fail to be treated as a tax-
free transaction under Sections 368, 355 and 361 of the Code, (iii) the
Splitco Merger and the Malone Contribution, taken together, to fail to qualify
as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code, or (iv) the DIRECTV Merger,
the Splitco Merger and the Malone Contribution, taken together, to fail  to
be treated as exchanges described in Section 351 of the Code.

  

(b) DIRECTV shall cooperate with Liberty and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to assist Liberty in obtaining the IRS Ruling and any other
rulings from the IRS regarding the Transactions. Liberty shall provide DIRECTV
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each submission to be
filed by Liberty with the IRS in  connection with obtaining the IRS Ruling
(an " _IRS Ruling Submission_ ") prior to the filing of such submission with
the IRS. No IRS Ruling Submission shall be filed by Liberty with the IRS
unless, prior to such filing, DIRECTV shall have agreed (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) as to the contents of
such submission to the extent that the submission (i) includes statements or 
representations relating to facts that are or will be under the control of
DIRECTV, Holdings or any of their Subsidiaries or (ii) is relevant to, or
creates, any actual or potential obligations of, or limitations on, DIRECTV,
Holdings or any of their Subsidiaries including any such obligations of, or
limitations on, Splitco or its Subsidiaries under the Reorganization Agreement
and other documents related to the Restructuring and Split-Off; _provided, 
however_ , that if the IRS requests same-day filing of an IRS Ruling
Submission that does not include any material issue or statement, then Liberty
is required only to make a good faith effort to notify DIRECTV's
Representatives and to give such Representatives an opportunity to review and
comment on such submission prior to filing it with the IRS. Neither Liberty
nor its Representatives shall conduct any substantive communications with the
IRS  regarding any material issue arising with respect to the IRS Ruling,
including meetings or conferences with IRS personnel, whether telephonically,
in person or otherwise, without first notifying DIRECTV (or its
Representatives) and giving DIRECTV (or its Representatives) a reasonable
opportunity to participate, and a reasonable number of its Representatives
shall have an opportunity to participate in all conferences or meetings with
IRS personnel that take place in person,  regardless of the nature of the
issues expected to be discussed; _provided, however_ , that in the case of
communications concerning the IRS Ruling that occur during an unscheduled
conference initiated by the IRS or a conference initiated by Liberty or its
Representatives for a purpose unrelated to the IRS Ruling in connection with
which it is not reasonably practicable to provide to DIRECTV or its
Representatives advance notice and an  opportunity to participate, Liberty or
Splitco (or their Representatives) shall promptly update DIRECTV and its

  



        

     |  

71

      



  

Representatives as to the content of such communications. Prior to the Split-
Off, Liberty shall, and following the Split-Off, Splitco shall, provide
DIRECTV with copies of each IRS Ruling Submission filed with the IRS promptly
following the filing thereof and with copies of any correspondence related to
the IRS Ruling received by Liberty or Splitco from the IRS.

  

(c) At the Closing, Splitco shall deliver to Holdings a certificate, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to DIRECTV and that complies with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h), to the effect that interests in
Splitco are not United States real property interests. For purposes of the
foregoing, DIRECTV shall provide assistance  to Splitco, and cooperate with
Splitco, in making any determination required by the aforementioned
certificate insofar as the assets of DIRECTV and its Subsidiaries are relevant
to such determination.

_Rule 16b-3_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) Prior to the Split-Off Effective Time, each of Liberty and Splitco
shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to
cause (i) dispositions of Liberty Entertainment's equity securities (including
derivative securities), and (ii) acquisitions of Splitco's equity securities
(including derivative  securities), pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of Liberty
or Splitco to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in
accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by
the SEC regarding such matters (the " _No-Action Letter_ ").

  

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, each of Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings and DIRECTV shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by
any party hereto to cause (i) dispositions of Splitco's (including in
connection with the Malone Contribution) equity securities (including
derivative securities), (ii) dispositions of  DIRECTV's equity securities
(including derivative securities) and (iii) acquisitions (including in
connection with the Malone Contribution) of Holdings' equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of Liberty,
Splitco, Holdings or DIRECTV to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act in accordance with the No-Action Letter.

  

(c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, if DIRECTV acquires DIRECTV
equity securities from Greenlady or Greenlady II, DIRECTV shall take such
steps as may be reasonably requested by Liberty or Splitco for such
disposition by Greenlady or Greenlady II to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

        

SECTION 6.16

     |  

_Employee Matters_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) Liberty and Splitco have provided DIRECTV with a schedule that sets
forth, as of April 30, 2009, the name of each employee of Splitco and its
Subsidiaries who will by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be employed by a Subsidiary of Holdings immediately following the
Merger Effective Time  (" _Transferred Employees_ "), along with such
employee's job title and reporting position, current salary and incentive
bonus opportunities, and years of service, and designating such employee's
status as exempt or non-exempt under the FLSA, active or on leave, and whether
such employee is full-time or part-time.

Prior to the Closing, Splitco shall update the schedule delivered pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 6.16(a).

  

(b) Holdings acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of the Closing
Date, each Transferred Employee, including any such employee on approved leave
of absence (whether family leave, workers' maternity or parental leave,
workers compensation, short-term and long-term disability, medical leave or
otherwise) shall be employed in a  substantially comparable position to the
position in which such employee was employed immediately prior to Closing
Date. As of and for no less than one year following the Closing, Holdings
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide Transferred Employees who
remain employed with Holdings and its Subsidiaries with the same rate of base
salary and wages and commissions and with employee benefit and compensation
plans, programs and arrangements that are substantially equivalent  in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Holdings and
its Subsidiaries. Any Transferred Employee who became entitled to short-term
or long-term disability benefits under the applicable Splitco Employee Benefit
Plans which are not Transferred Employee Benefit Plans (the " _Seller
Disability Plans_ ") prior to Closing shall be entitled to continue to receive
such benefits under the terms of the  Seller Disability Plans until his or
her return to active employment, so long as such benefits are payable pursuant
to third-party insurance coverage. Liberty agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the insurance policies underlying the Seller
Disability Plans to provide for such payments. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall have no
obligation to keep any Transferred Employee employed for any period of time 
following the Closing, provided that if the employment of any Transferred
Employee is terminated by Holdings or its Subsidiaries during the twelve-month
period beginning on the Closing Date, Holdings or its Subsidiaries shall pay
to such terminated employee severance payments that are no less favorable than
those provided under the Splitco Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Following the Closing, Holdings shall assume and honor
and/or shall cause its  Subsidiaries to continue to honor in accordance with
their terms all Splitco Employment Agreements, and Liberty and its Affiliates
shall cease to have any further obligations under the Splitco Employment
Agreements as of the Closing Date. Liberty and Splitco shall take all actions
necessary such that following the Closing, the DIRECTV Indemnitees (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, Holdings), as applicable, shall have no
obligations and liabilities with respect to any employee  benefit plans,
arrangements or agreements sponsored or contributed to by Liberty, Splitco or
their respective Affiliates other than the Transferred Employee Benefit Plans,
the Splitco Stock Plans and the Splitco Employment Agreements. For all plans,
programs or arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Holdings
or its Subsidiaries in which the Transferred Employees shall be eligible to
participate, but excluding all tax qualified and non-qualified defined
benefit  retirement plans, Holdings shall cause each such plan, program or
arrangement to treat the prior service of each Transferred Employee with
Liberty, Splitco or any of their respective Affiliates as service rendered to
Holdings for purposes of (i) eligibility and (ii) solely with respect to
severance plans, vacation policies and qualified and non-qualified defined
contribution retirement plans, vesting, except to the extent that such
treatment would result in the duplication of  benefits with respect to the
same period of service. From and after the Closing, Holdings and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions, limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Holdings or its
Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent such condition would have been covered, or
limitation or waiting period would not have applied,

  



        

     |  

73

      



  

with respect to such Transferred Employee (or dependent) under the terms of
the Splitco Employee Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee was a
participant immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) give each Transferred
Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred
prior to the Closing. Liberty  and its Affiliates shall be exclusively
responsible for complying with continued group health plan coverage under
Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code (or any similar
state Law) (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to employees of Liberty or any of its
Affiliates who participated in group health plans sponsored and maintained by
Liberty by reason of such employees\' termination of employment with Liberty
or any of  its Affiliates on or prior to the Split-off Effective Time, and
Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall not have any obligation or liability to
provide rights under COBRA on account of any such termination of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Transferred Employees
employed by the non-RSN Splitco Business, and in light of Holding\'s limited
governance rights with respect to the non-RSN Splitco Business after the
Merger Effective Time, the covenants set forth  in this Section 6.16(b) shall
not apply to such Transferred Employees unless the approval of Sony Pictures
Cable Ventures I Inc. is obtained, and Holdings shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek such approval.

  

(c) Effective as of the Closing, Liberty, Splitco and their respective
Affiliates shall cause each Transferred Employee who participates in Liberty's
401(k) Savings Plan to be fully vested in his or her accrued benefit under
such 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Closing.

  

(d) Neither Liberty, Splitco nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall accelerate vesting of any compensation, benefits, equity awards or
equity-based compensation, excluding any vesting that occurs automatically
solely by reason of the Split-Off under the terms of the applicable
arrangements in effect as of the date  hereof.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Splitco Employee Benefit Plan, or shall limit the right of Holdings,
Splitco, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any  Transferred Employee Benefit Plan
following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other than Liberty
makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement
as an amendment to any Splitco Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii) such provision
is deemed to be an amendment to such Splitco Employee Benefit Plan even though
not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. Each  of Liberty and
Splitco acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained in this Section
6.16 with respect to the Transferred Employees are included for the sole
benefit of Liberty and Splitco, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(i) in any other Person, including, any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Splitco Employee Benefit Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or  (ii) to continued employment with Holdings, Splitco,
the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates.

  

SECTION 6.17 _Sole Stockholder Approvals_. No later than ten (10)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, Holdings shall deliver to
Merger Sub One

  



        

     |  

74

      



  

and Merger Sub Two written consents, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub One
and Merger Sub Two, in compliance with the DGCL, adopting this Agreement (as
the terms and conditions hereof may be amended, modified or waived). No later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, a
meeting of the sole stockholder of Splitco shall be held, in compliance with
the DGCL, and at such  meeting the sole stockholder shall adopt this
Agreement and approve the Splitco Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof (as such terms and conditions may be amended, modified or
waived). The consents and approvals referred to in this Section 6.17
collectively, the " _Sole Stockholder Approvals_."

  

SECTION 6.18 _Intercompany Payables_. Except as provided in
Section 6.2(b), all intercompany payables and loans owed to Liberty or its
Subsidiaries (except for those Subsidiaries related to the Splitco Business),
on the one hand, by an entity that is part of the Splitco Business, on the 
other hand, shall, prior to or at the Split-Off Effective Time, be canceled or
extinguished without payment therefor being made.

  

SECTION 6.19 _Indemnification Claims_. After the date hereof and
prior to the earlier of (x) the Merger Effective Time, (y) the expiration of
the applicable indemnification period under the Share Exchange Agreement and
(z) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, 
Liberty, Splitco and DIRECTV shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with one another and use their reasonable best
efforts to determine whether any claims for indemnification exist pursuant to
the Share Exchange Agreement. To the extent any such claims exist, Liberty and
Splitco shall submit such claims to News prior to the expiration of the
indemnification period in accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange
Agreement.

        

SECTION 6.20

     |  

_Greenlady Debt_.

    
---|--- 
    

(a) Prior to the Split-Off Effective Time, Greenlady II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Greenlady II_ "), may pay scheduled
maturities under the Greenlady Debt in accordance with its terms, together
with amounts that become due thereunder by virtue of the exercise by  Bank of
America, N.A. (" _Bank of America_ ") of its partial unwind right in the
associated equity collars following the occurrence of an "Insider Acquisition
Event" or other "Adjustment Event" (as such terms are defined in the equity
collars) caused by actions of DIRECTV (collectively, " _Permitted Payments_ ")
(such Permitted Payments prior  to the Split-Off Effective Time, if and when
made, the " _Pre-Split-Off Greenlady Debt Repayments_ "). In accordance with
the Restructuring, Greenlady has entered into on the date hereof a credit
facility with Liberty attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto (the " _Liberty Revolving
Credit Facility_ "), pursuant to which  Liberty shall fund the Pre-Split-Off
Greenlady Debt Repayments on or prior to the Split-Off Effective Time. DIRECTV
has entered into on the date hereof a secured credit facility attached as
_Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _DIRECTV Credit Facility_ ") with Greenlady,
pursuant to which (and subject to the conditions therein) DIRECTV shall
advance funds sufficient to enable Greenlady  to repay the Liberty Revolving
Credit Facility (up to a maximum of $300,000,000) immediately following the
Split-Off Effective Time; _provided_ that prior thereto DIRECTV may require,
in its sole discretion, that Liberty provide evidence confirming receipt of
the Greenlady Debt Repayments by Bank of America and a written certification
from its chief financial officer certifying that the funds used for each
Greenlady Debt Repayment  were not attributable to, or generated by, the
Splitco Business. The DIRECTV Credit Facility shall provide for Greenlady to

  



        

     |  

75

      



  

borrow amounts aggregating (together with prior advances) up to $650,000,000
after the Split-Off Effective Time (subject to the conditions therein) to
enable Greenlady to make additional Permitted Payments prior to the Merger
Effective Time. The DIRECTV Credit Facility and the Liberty Revolving Credit
Facility shall be repaid and be subject to such terms and conditions as are
provided therein. 

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Liberty and Splitco shall use their
reasonable best efforts to assist DIRECTV, and to provide DIRECTV all
cooperation reasonably requested by it, to cause Bank of America to amend the
debt issued pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of April 9,
2008, by and between Greenlady II, LLC and Bank of  America, and the equity
collars associated therewith (the " _Greenlady Debt_ ") in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to DIRECTV, including a release of any and all Liens held by Bank
of America on the Greenlady II DIRECTV Shares (the " _Greenlady Debt
Restructuring_ "). Nothing contained in this Section 6.20(b) shall require
Liberty, Splitco or any of their respective  Subsidiaries to pay any fee or
incur any other Liability in connection with the Greenlady Debt Restructuring.
If the parties are unable to effect the Greenlady Debt Restructuring by the
time all other conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied (other than
those which by their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing), then at the
Closing DIRECTV shall repay the Greenlady Debt in full, without any cost or
liability to Liberty, Splitco or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 
Except as contemplated by this _Section 6.20(b)_ , Liberty and Splitco shall
not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, amend, terminate,
modify or abandon any agreement, document or arrangement relating to the
Greenlady Debt without the prior written consent of DIRECTV. DIRECTV
acknowledges that Liberty intends to seek to terminate the guaranty of Liberty
with respect to the equity collars associated with the Greenlady  Debt not
later than the Split-Off Effective Time and that a guarantee of Splitco may be
substituted therefore.

  

SECTION 6.21 _Splitco Cash Amount_. Liberty shall cause Splitco to
possess, directly or indirectly, at the Split-Off Effective Time an amount of
cash or cash equivalents equal to at least the Splitco Cash Amount; _provided_
that under no  circumstances shall the Splitco Cash Amount be held by a RSN
Subsidiary, GSN or FUN Technologies or any of their Subsidiaries.

  

SECTION 6.22 _No Acquisition of a Liberty Entertainment Interest
by DIRECTV_. From and after the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the
Merger Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, DIRECTV will not
acquire, directly or indirectly, any Liberty Entertainment  Interest.

  

SECTION 6.23 _No Acquisition of a Splitco Interest by DIRECTV_.
From and after the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the Merger
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, DIRECTV will not

(a) Liberty agrees that during the period from the date hereof to the
Split-Off Effective Time (the " _Pre-Split-Off Period_ "), it will (i) cause
Splitco and its Subsidiaries to perform in all material respects their
respective obligations under this Agreement in accordance with  the terms
hereof and (ii) be responsible for any Liability arising out of a breach of

failure of Splitco to perform any of its covenants, agreements or obligations
hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

(b) Effective as of the Split-Off Effective Time, Liberty hereby
transfers, assigns and conveys to Splitco all of Liberty's rights and benefits

6.25 and 9.2 (such  rights, collectively, the " _Retained Rights_ "),
_provided_ that nothing herein shall affect any of Splitco's or DIRECTV's
rights (other than against Liberty) under such sections) (such assigned rights
and benefits, collectively, the " _Assigned Rights_ "). Effective as of the
Split-Off Effective Time,  Splitco accepts the Assigned Rights and assumes
and agrees to be bound by all of Liberty's liabilities and obligations under
this Agreement (the " _Assigned Obligations_ "), and to perform the Assigned
Obligations in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ that, such
assumption of liabilities and obligations is subject to Section 6.24(c).

  

(c) Effective as of the Split-Off Effective Time, (x) DIRECTV, Splitco,
Holdings, Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two hereby release Liberty from any
obligations and liabilities relating to (i) any breach by Liberty or Splitco
of any representation or warranty made by either of them hereunder or the
failure of Liberty or Splitco to perform  any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Liberty or Splitco hereunder, (ii) Liberty's
obligation pursuant to this Agreement to cause Splitco to perform its
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder and (iii) Splitco's performance
after the Split-Off Effective Time of the Assigned Rights and Assigned
Obligations (for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not constitute a
release in favor of Splitco with respect to any of the obligations of 
Splitco hereunder) and (y) Liberty hereby releases each of DIRECTV, Splitco,
Holdings, Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two from any obligations and
liabilities relating to any breach by it of any representation or warranty
made by it hereunder or its failure to perform in all material respects any
covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by it hereunder (other than
any obligation of DIRECTV with respect to a Retained Right). In furtherance of
and not in limitation of the  foregoing, the parties agree that from and
after the Split-Off Effective Time, DIRECTV, Holdings, Merger Sub One and
Merger Sub Two will look solely to Splitco with respect to the performance of
Splitco's and Liberty's covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder and
with respect to any liability of Splitco or Liberty hereunder, whether such
obligation or liability arises before or after the Split-Off Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, the foregoing
releases shall not affect the obligations of Liberty and the rights of DIRECTV
under Sections 3.14, 6.6 (but only as to clauses (c), (d), (e), (f)(i),
(f)(iv), (g) and (h) thereof), 6.9, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20(b),

DIRECTV or any of its Subsidiaries).

_Tax Matters_.

    
---|--- 
    

(i) (A) DIRECTV shall have received an opinion of its counsel, Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
DIRECTV, dated the Closing Date, or Liberty shall have received a private
letter ruling from the IRS (which ruling shall not have been withdrawn,
invalidated or modified  in an adverse manner), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to DIRECTV, to the effect that the DIRECTV Merger,
taken together with the Splitco Merger and the Malone Contribution, will be
treated, for United States federal income tax purposes, as exchanges described
in Section 351 of the Code. In rendering any such opinion, such counsel shall
be entitled to rely upon the Malone Certificate and customary assumptions and
certificates of officers of Splitco, Holdings and  DIRECTV delivered to such
counsel in connection with such opinions. (B) Liberty shall have received a
private letter ruling from the IRS (which ruling shall not have been
withdrawn, invalidated or modified in an adverse manner) with respect to the
matters described in _Section 7.2(i)(i) of the Liberty Disclosure Schedule_.

IRS (which ruling shall not have been withdrawn, invalidated or modified in an

Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, dated the Redemption Date (which
opinion,  such firm shall have confirmed in writing on the Closing Date, if
the Redemption Date is not the same date as the Closing Date, shall not have
been withdrawn, invalidated or modified in an adverse manner), in each case,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to DIRECTV, substantially to the
effect that the Contribution and the Split-Off will qualify as a tax-free
transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code; no gain or loss
will be recognized by Liberty upon the  distribution of Splitco Common Stock;
no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be included in the
income of, holders of Liberty Entertainment Common Stock upon the exchange of
shares of Liberty Entertainment Common Stock for shares of Splitco Common
Stock (except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares);
and, in the case of the IRS private letter ruling, such other rulings as set
forth in _Section 7.2(i)(ii) of the Liberty  Disclosure Schedule_ ; (x)
Liberty or Splitco shall have received a private letter ruling from the IRS

opinions, such counsel shall be  entitled to rely upon customary assumptions
and certificates of officers of Liberty, Splitco, Holdings and DIRECTV
delivered to such counsel in connection with such opinions.

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a DIRECTV Material Adverse Effect. The  representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.2 and 5.6 shall be true and correct in all
respects (other than clause (x) of the fourth sentence of Section 5.2, which
shall be true and correct in all material respects) at and as of the Closing
Date as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as

received a certificate signed on behalf of DIRECTV by an authorized officer, 
dated as of the Closing Date, to such effect;

(d) _No Restraint_. No Restraint that could reasonably be expected to
result, directly or indirectly, in any of the effects referred to in Section
7.3(c) shall be in effect;

Splitco, substantially to the effect that the Contribution and the Split-Off

the Code;  no gain or loss will be recognized by Liberty upon the
distribution of Splitco Common Stock; no gain or loss will be recognized by,
and no amount will be included in the income of, holders of Liberty
Entertainment Common Stock upon the exchange of shares of Liberty
Entertainment Common Stock for shares of Splitco Common Stock (except with
respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares); and, in the case of
the IRS private letter ruling, such other rulings as set forth in  _Section
7.2(i)(ii) of the Liberty Disclosure Schedule_ ; (ii) Liberty or Splitco shall
have received a private letter ruling from the IRS (which ruling shall not
have been withdrawn, invalidated or modified in an adverse manner), or Splitco
shall have received a tax opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom

     |  

83

      



  

Code of, and will not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to, (I) the
News Exchange or (II) any of the internal distributions of the stock of
Greenlady that were effected by Subsidiaries of News in connection with the
News Exchange and (iv) if the Redemption Date is not the same date as the
Closing Date, Liberty and Splitco shall have received a tax opinion from
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and  Flom LLP, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Liberty and Splitco, dated the Closing Date, substantially to
the effect that the Splitco Merger, the Malone Contribution and the DIRECTV
Merger, taken together, will not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to
the Split-Off. In rendering any such opinions, such counsel shall be entitled
to rely upon customary assumptions and certificates of officers of Liberty,
Splitco, Holdings and DIRECTV delivered to such counsel in  connection with
such opinions.

  

SECTION 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings or DIRECTV may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such party's failure to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Mergers and the other  Transactions, as required by and
subject to Section 6.6.

any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in

not conditional or withdrawn) to make a DIRECTV Takeover Proposal, and (ii)

other hand, pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iv), then DIRECTV shall pay to Splitco
the Expense Reimbursement; provided that DIRECTV shall not reimburse Splitco
for any out-of-pocket costs or expenses related solely to the Split-Off. In
addition, if DIRECTV or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enters into a DIRECTV
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any DIRECTV Takeover Proposal within
nine months of the date of the termination referenced in clause (ii)  in the
previous sentence and the transactions contemplated by such DIRECTV

DIRECTV of notice of demand for payment following such consummation). Any
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.3(d) shall be  made
promptly following the consummation of any DIRECTV Takeover Proposal (and in
any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to DIRECTV by
Splitco of notice of demand for payment following such consummation).

  

(g) In the event that Liberty and Splitco, on the one hand, or DIRECTV,
on the other hand, shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required pursuant to
this Section 9.3 when due, such fee shall accrue interest for the period
commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to the rate
of interest publicly announced by  Citibank, N.A. in New York City from time
to time during such period, as such bank's prime lending rate plus 3%. In
addition, if Liberty and Splitco, on the one hand, or DIRECTV, on the other
hand, shall fail to pay such fee when due, the non-paying party shall also pay
to the other party all of its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
in connection with efforts to collect such fee. Liberty, Splitco and DIRECTV

ARTICLE X

  

_Miscellaneous_

  

SECTION 10.1 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the
Merger Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any
and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Liberty Stockholder
Approval, the DIRECTV Stockholder Approval or the Splitco Stockholder 
Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors; _provided, however_ , that following approval
of the Transactions by the holders of Liberty Entertainment Common Stock, the
stockholders of DIRECTV or the stockholders of Splitco, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the holders of Liberty Entertainment  Common Stock, the
stockholders of DIRECTV or the stockholders of Splitco without such approval.

  

SECTION 10.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior
to the Merger Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the 
obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Liberty, Splitco,
Holdings, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or DIRECTV in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or  further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

SECTION 10.3 _Assignment_. Except as provided in Section 6.24,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law (other
than as a result of a merger or business combination involving Liberty, the 
primary purpose of which is not to avoid its obligations under this Agreement;
_provided,_ that such merger or business combination involving Liberty would
not reasonably be expected to impede or delay, in any material respect, the
consummation of the Transactions) or otherwise, by any of the parties without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure  to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
shall be null and void.

  

SECTION 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the 
parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

SECTION 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement, any agreement entered into
at the Closing in

  



        

     |  

88

      



  

accordance with the terms of any Transaction Agreement, the Liberty Disclosure

(a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for the
provisions of  Section 6.10, are not intended to and shall not confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

---|--- 
    

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement will be brought  exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Chancery Court_ "), or, if
the Delaware Chancery Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the
federal courts located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby
consents to personal jurisdiction in any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
and irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,  each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 10.8 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN  RESPECT TO ANY ACTION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY
MAKES  THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.6.

  

SECTION 10.7 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be 
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this

Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
