      Assets) owned by EPIL, (y) the sum of $301,975,000 in consideration for
      EPIL terminating the Distribution and Co-Promotion Agreement, whereby EPIL

      certain of Wyeth's trademarks, patents and certain other intellectual
      property relating to Sonata in connection therewith, and its option to
      purchase from Wyeth the rights in and to Sonata in the Sonata Territory
      and (z) the sum of $2,500 in respect of the Irish Purchased Assets owned
      by EPIL (collectively, the "EPIL Consideration") and (B) EPI, (x) subject

      in respect of the Irish Purchased Assets owned by EPI and (z) if positive,
      the Estimated Closing Date Inventory Value minus $40,000,000 (to the
      extent that the amount in this clause (z) is negative, it will reduce the
      amount to be delivered under clause (i)(B)(x) above by a corresponding
      amount) (collectively, the "EPI Consideration" and, together with the EPIL
      Consideration, the "Purchase Price"), in each case payable on the Closing
      Date by electronic funds transfer of immediately available funds to the
      accounts of such entities; and

            (ii)  assume the Assumed Liabilities.

            (b)   The aggregate Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall
be adjusted as follows:

            (i)   the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to
      the increase over $55,000,000 in the Wyeth Purchase Price to be paid by
      the Acquirors pursuant to Section 1.01 of the Wyeth/King Asset Transfer

<PAGE>
            (ii)  (x) the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal
      to the aggregate amount of the reduction in the aggregate Capacity
      Commitment Fees (as defined in the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement) required
      to be paid pursuant to the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement because the Closing
      has occurred on or after April 1, 2003 pursuant to Section 3.01(a) of the
      Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement and (y) the Purchase Price shall be increased
      by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the reduction in the
      aggregate Supply Incentive Fees (as defined in the Wyeth/Elan Supply
      Agreement) required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the
      Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement.

            (c)   The aggregate Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall
be funded through (i) release of the Escrow Amount and (ii) to the extent such
aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified in writing by the Elan
Companies and, in each case, in accordance with clause (a)(i) set forth above in
this Section 4.01.

            SECTION 4.02. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code, and the Acquirors and the Elan Companies agree (a) to report the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes in accordance with such
allocations and (b) not to take any position inconsistent with such allocations
on any of their respective tax returns. The Elan Companies shall initially
determine and send written Notice to the Acquirors of the allocation of the
Purchase Price within 30 days after the Closing Date. The Acquirors will be
deemed to have accepted such allocation unless it provides written Notice of
disagreement to the Elan Companies within 10 days after the receipt of the Elan
Companies' Notice of allocation. If the Acquirors provide such Notice of
disagreement to the Elan Companies, the parties shall proceed in good faith to
determine the allocation in dispute. If, within 10 days after the Elan Companies
receive the Acquirors' Notice of disagreement, the parties have not reached
agreement, the Accountants shall be engaged to determine the final allocation in
dispute. The Elan Companies and the Acquirors shall share equally the fees of
such Accountants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this
Section 4.02, in no event shall any portion of the EPIL Consideration be
allocated to EPI (or to the assets owned by EPI) or any portion of the EPI
Consideration be allocated to EPIL (or to the assets owned by EPIL).

            SECTION 4.03. Sales, Use and Other Taxes. (a) All transfer,
documentary, sales, use, valued-added, gross receipts, stamp, registration or
other similar transfer taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the transfer and sale of the Purchased Assets as contemplated by
the terms of this Agreement, including all recording or filing fees, notarial
fees and other similar costs of Closing, that may be imposed, payable,
collectible or incurred shall be borne by the Acquirors. The Acquirors shall
execute and deliver to the Elan Companies at Closing any resale exemption
certificate or other document required to secure an exemption from any
applicable Transfer Taxes. The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with
each other to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, any
applicable Transfer Taxes.


                                      -26-
<PAGE>
            (b)   The Purchase Price shall be exclusive of any value added tax
which, if charged, shall be payable by the Acquirors.

            SECTION 4.04. Tax Withholding. All payments under this Agreement
will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any
Taxes. The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with each other,
including by completing or filing documents required under the provisions of any
applicable income tax treaty or applicable Law, to claim any applicable
exemption from, or reduction of, any such applicable Taxes.

            SECTION 4.05. Closing Date Inventory Value Adjustments. (a) As
promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than 30 days after the
Closing Date, the Elan Companies shall prepare and deliver to the Acquirors a
statement calculating the Closing Date Inventory Value (the "Closing Date
Inventory Value Statement").

            (b)   During the 30 day period immediately following the Acquirors'
receipt of the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement, the Acquirors shall be
permitted to review the Elan Companies' Books and Records to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Acquirors to evaluate the Closing Date Inventory
Value Statement. The Closing Date Inventory Value Statement shall become final
and binding upon the Acquirors and the Elan Companies at the end of such 30 day
period, unless the Acquirors object to the Closing Date Inventory Value
Statement, in which case they shall send written notice (the "Notice of
Objection") to the Elan Companies within such period, setting forth in specific
detail the basis for their objection and their proposal for any adjustments to
the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement. If a timely Notice of Objection is
received by the Elan Companies, then the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement
shall become final and binding (except as provided below with respect to
resolution of disputes) on the Elan Companies and the Acquirors on the first to
occur of (x) the date the Elan Companies and the Acquirors resolve in writing
any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Objection and (y) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in
writing by the Accountants, in each case as provided below. The Elan Companies
and the Acquirors shall seek in good faith to reach agreement as to any such
proposed adjustment or that no such adjustment is necessary within 10 days
following receipt of the Notice of Objection. If agreement is reached in writing
within such 10 day period as to all proposed adjustments, or that no adjustments
are necessary, the Elan Companies and the Acquirors shall revise the Closing
Date Inventory Value Statement accordingly. If the Elan Companies and the
Acquirors are unable to reach agreement within 10 days following receipt of the
Notice of Objection, then the Accountants shall be engaged at that time to
review the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement, and shall make a
determination as to the resolution of any adjustments. The determination of the
Accountants shall be delivered as soon as practicable following engagement of
the Accountants, but in no event more than 30 days thereafter, and shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Elan Companies and the Acquirors and the
parties shall revise the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement accordingly. The
parties agree that judgment may be entered on such determination in any court
having jurisdiction. The Elan Companies, on the one hand, and the Acquirors, on
the other hand, shall each pay one-half of the cost of the Accountants. Within
10 days after the date on


                                      -27-
<PAGE>
which the Closing Date Inventory Value Statement becomes final and binding on
the Elan Companies and the Acquirors, the Acquirors shall pay the Closing Date
Inventory Value Adjustment to the Elan Companies, if positive, and the Elan
Companies shall pay the Closing Date Inventory Value Adjustment to the
Acquirors, if negative.

            SECTION 4.06. Skelaxin Purchase Price Adjustment. If a Skelaxin
Adverse Determination Event shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31,
2003, on January 2, 2004, the Acquirors shall pay or cause to be paid to EPI, by
electronic funds transfer of immediately available funds to the account of EPI,
the additional sum of $25,000,000 in respect of the Skelaxin Assets. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 4.06 shall be deemed to be part of the Purchase Price.
The Acquirors shall not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the Skelaxin Intellectual Property in any transaction or
series of related transactions to any Person unless, as a condition thereto,
such Person assumes in writing (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Elan Companies) all of the King Companies' obligations under this Section
4.06 (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit any
security interest on the Skelaxin Intellectual Property; provided, however, that
upon the foreclosure of any such security interest, the assignee shall take such
Skelaxin Intellectual Property subject to the King Companies' obligations under
this Agreement). In addition, (x) not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to
any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any portion of the
Skelaxin Intellectual Property and (y) not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the grant of any Encumbrance on any portion of the Skelaxin
Intellectual Property, in each case, the King Companies shall notify the Elan
Companies thereof in writing and promptly provide the Elan Companies with any
information relating thereto as the Elan Companies shall reasonably request.

commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Wyeth/Elan Agreements or the
Wyeth/King Agreements as required by and subject to this Section 8.03 and
Section 8.02.

or any registrations issued or issuing with respect thereto. The Acquirors
further agree that all use of the Corporate Names by the Acquirors or their
Affiliates shall be for the benefit of the Elan Companies and the goodwill
accrued in connection with its use of the Corporate Names shall accrue to the
Elan Parent and/or the Elan Companies as appropriate. In the event the Acquirors
acquire any rights relating to the Corporate Names for any reason, the Acquirors
agree to assign, at no cost, all such rights, to-


                                      -50-
<PAGE>
gether with any related goodwill, to the Elan Parent or the Elan Companies as
appropriate. The Acquirors shall each use commercially reasonable efforts not to
do any act which endangers, destroys or similarly affects the value of the
goodwill pertaining to the Corporate Names and further agrees that it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the same quality of the Products as
used by the Elan Companies in the operation of the Businesses as of the Closing
for any Product sold under the Corporate Names. Except as provided in this
Section 8.06, the Acquirors further agree that they will not alter, change,
deface or obliterate the Corporate Names on Skelaxin Marketing Materials, Sonata
Marketing Materials or Labeling for either Skelaxin or Sonata. The Acquirors
will at any time execute any documents reasonably required by the Elan Companies
to confirm the Elan Companies' ownership of all such rights in the Corporate
Names. The Acquirors shall not use in connection with the Products, or allow any
of their Affiliates to use in connection with the Products, any other trademark
or trade name which is similar to or substantially similar to or so nearly
resembles the Corporate Names as to be likely to cause deception or confusion.

            SECTION 8.07. Regulatory Matters. From and after the transfer by the
Elan Companies to the Acquirors of each Skelaxin Product Registration held by
the Elan Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Acquirors shall be solely responsible and liable for (i) taking all
actions, paying all fees and conducting all communication with the appropriate
Governmental or Regulatory Authority required by Law in respect of such Skelaxin
Product Registration, including preparing and filing all reports (including
adverse drug experience reports) with the appropriate Governmental or Regulatory
Authority, (ii) taking all actions and conducting all communication with third
parties in respect of Skelaxin sold pursuant to such Skelaxin Product
Registration (whether sold before or after transfer of such Skelaxin Product
Registration), including responding to all complaints in respect thereof,
including complaints related to tampering or contamination, and (iii)
investigating all complaints and adverse drug experiences in respect of Skelaxin
sold pursuant to such Skelaxin Product Registration (whether sold before or
after transfer of such Skelaxin Product Registration).

            SECTION 8.08. Returns, Rebates and Chargebacks. (a) (i) As of the
Closing Date, each of the Elan Companies and the Acquirors will process and
issue credits (or render payment in such other form as the parties hereto may
determine) for all returned Products they are financially responsible for in
accordance with subsections (iii) and (iv) below. The Acquirors will not bill
the Elan Companies for the administrative costs of processing claims for
returned Products for which the Acquirors are financially responsible for in
accordance with subsections (iii) and (iv) below. The Elan Companies will not
bill the Acquirors for the administrative costs of processing claims for
returned Products for which the Elan Companies are financially responsible for
in accordance with subsections (iii) and (iv) below. Such handling of returned
Products by the Acquirors or the Elan Companies, as applicable, and the issuance
of any credits or other form of reimbursement in connection therewith, shall be
in accordance with the Acquirors' or the Elan Companies' current returned goods
policy, as applicable. The Acquirors' returned product policy is set forth on
Schedule 8.08(a) of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule and the Acquirors will not
alter such policy until at least nine


                                      -51-
<PAGE>
(9) months after the Closing Date in any way that may reasonably be expected to
increase Product returns during such period. The Acquirors hereby agree that
they shall take no actions to solicit or otherwise encourage Product returns
after the Closing.

            (ii)  The Elan Companies and the Acquirors will use commercially
reasonable efforts in requesting that customers direct all Product returns after
the Closing Date to the Acquirors. All returned Products received by the
Acquirors or the Elan Companies after the Closing Date will be destroyed by such
party at its respective returns handling facility. After such destruction, each
party will forward to the other party any necessary accompanying documentation
to determine the appropriate credit. If the Acquirors or the Elan Companies
destroy Products for which the other was financially responsible as set forth in
Sections 8.08(a)(iii) and (iv), that party shall bill the other party for the
cost of the destruction. Each such invoice shall set forth the number of units
processed, together with such other information as shall be necessary to support
the invoice. Each party shall, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of
invoice, pay the other party for the full invoiced amount.

            (iii) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the Elan
Companies' shall be financially responsible only for returned Product bearing
the Elan Companies' National Drug Code ("NDC") numbers (or a Wyeth NDC Number
with respect to Sonata) and evidenced as being sold by the Elan Companies on or
before the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Elan Companies' maximum
financial liability for or other reimbursement for such returned Products shall
be one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) with respect to
Skelaxin (the "Skelaxin Maximum Returns Credit Amount"), and one million five
hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) with respect to Sonata (the "Sonata
Maximum Returns Credit Amount"). The Acquirors further agree that the Elan
Companies' financial obligation for credits or other reimbursement for such
returned Products shall terminate with respect to Sonata upon the first to occur
of the date on which the Elan Companies have issued credits in the amount of or
otherwise reimbursed the Sonata Maximum Returns Credit Amount or nine (9) months
after the Closing Date (the "Sonata Returns Termination Date"), and with respect
to Skelaxin upon the first to occur of the date on which the Elan Companies have
issued credits in the amount of or otherwise reimbursed the Skelaxin Maximum
Returns Credit Amount or nine (9) months after the Closing Date (the "Skelaxin
Returns Termination Date"). For purposes of this Section 8.08(a)(iii), the
dollar value of returned Products paid or credited for by the Elan Companies
shall be determined in accordance with the Elan Companies' then current returned
goods policy.

            (iv)  The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the Acquirors
shall be financially responsible only for returned Products bearing the
Acquirors' NDC number or evidenced as being sold by the Acquirors after the
Closing Date, and for all returned Products (regardless of NDC number or date of
sale) with respect to Sonata, after the Sonata Returns Termination Date and,
with respect to Skelaxin, after the Skelaxin Returns Termination Date. For
purposes of this Section 8.08(a)(iv), the dollar value of returned Products paid
or credited for by the Acquirors shall be determined in accordance with the
Acquirors' then current returned goods policy.

            (b)   (i) With respect to rebates that the Elan Companies are
obligated to pay pursuant to any government (federal or state) rebate program
for amounts charged to the Elan Companies' NDC codes with respect to Skelaxin
and to Wyeth NDC codes with respect to Sonata, relating to sales of the Products
("Government Rebates"), the Elan Companies shall be solely responsible for the
processing, handling and payment of all such rebates relating to the Products
which are billed to the Elan Companies. The Acquirors shall reimburse the Elan
Companies for all Government Rebates that the Elan Companies pay for all
invoices covering periods fifty (50) days after Closing; provided, however, that
the parties hereto acknowledge that Government Rebates are billed on a calendar
quarter basis and to the extent that such periods do not end on a calendar
quarter, the Acquirors shall reimburse the Elan Companies for such fractional
periods of any applicable quarter and for each full quarter thereafter as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing. The Elan Companies shall promptly bill the
Acquirors for any amounts due under this Section 8.08. The Acquirors shall not
be responsible for any amounts otherwise due to the Elan Companies under this
Section 8.08 which are not billed to the Acquirors within two (2) years after
they are invoiced to the Elan Companies under the government rebate program. All
payments due under this Section 8.08 shall be made promptly to the Elan
Companies upon submission to the Acquirors of invoices that describe the
requested payments in reasonable detail.

            (ii)  In the event any Acquiror disputes in good faith an amount
owed under a Government Rebate, the Elan Companies shall provide to such
Acquiror, upon such Acquiror's reasonable request, copies of any documents and
records evidencing the original rebate claims and any resubmissions of such
claims and data relating to unit rebate calculations which are necessary to
enable such Acquiror to resolve such disputed amount. In the event such Acquiror
disputes an amount owed under a Government Rebate, Acquiror shall be responsible
for reimbursing the Elan Companies the amounts paid by the Elan Companies and
then such Acquiror shall dispute the claim directly with the government/state.

            (iii) The Elan Companies shall provide the Acquirors with all
information relating to the Products and the prices thereof which the Acquirors
reasonably need in order to comply with applicable rules and regulations
relating to the Medicaid Rebate Agreement. When requested, such information
shall be provided by the Elan Companies to the Acquirors promptly, and in any
event, within fifteen (15) days after any Acquiror's written request therefore.
The Acquirors shall provide to the Elan Companies within twenty-five (25) days
after the end of each calendar quarter to enable the Elan Companies to comply
with their submission requirements to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (or any successor agency), the following information: (x) the "average
manufacturer price" (as defined under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.
Sections 1396r-8(k)(1)) for each Product identified by NDC number; (y) the "best
price" (as defined under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section
1396r-8(c)(1)(C)) for each Product identified by the NDC number; and (z) any
additional data or other information related to such Medicaid issues reasonably
requested in writing by any of the Elan Companies.


                                      -53-

            (iv)  With respect to any sales of Skelaxin by the King Companies to
any "covered entity" under the Public Health Service Act, as defined in 42
U.S.C. Section 256b(a)(4) (a "PHS entity"), which sales occur between the
Closing Date and that last day on which sales prior to the Closing Date are the
basis for the price to be paid by such PHS Entity pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section
256b(a), the Elan Companies shall pay to the Acquirors an amount equal to the
difference between the average manufacturer price for Skelaxin for the calendar
quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the amount required to be paid by such PHS
entity pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 256b(a) for any such sales. The Elan
Companies shall make such payments to the King Companies from time to time
within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by the Elan Companies of
documentation reasonably sufficient to document such payments and such other
documentation as the Elan Companies may reasonably request with respect to such
sales.

            (c)   The Elan Companies have provided to the Acquirors a list of
all commercial rebate agreements in which Products are included. The Elan
Companies and the Acquirors agree that the Elan Companies will continue to honor
all commercial rebate agreements for the fifty (50) day period immediately
following the Closing with respect to Sonata and for the fifty (50) day period
immediately following the Closing with respect to Skelaxin (collectively, the
"Interim Rebate Period") and the Elan Companies shall endeavor to terminate each
such agreement with respect to the Products at the end of the applicable Interim
Rebate Period. The Elan Companies shall be responsible, at their sole cost and
expense, for the processing, payment, administration and support of all
commercial rebates owed under these agreements for products dispensed during the
applicable Interim Rebate Period. On the first Business Day following the
Closing, the Elan Companies will issue a letter to the commercial rebate
customers advising such customers of the Elan Companies' responsibilities in
connection with commercial rebate agreements and associated rebates.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.08, in the
event the Elan Companies are unable to terminate the commercial rebate
agreements at the expiration of the applicable Interim Rebate Period, the
Acquirors shall reimburse the Elan Companies for the payment of commercial
rebates made by the Elan Companies for products dispensed on and after the
expiration of the applicable Interim Rebate Period.

            (d)   (i) The Elan Companies have provided to the Acquirors a list
of all government and commercial chargeback agreements in which Products are
included. The Elan Companies and the Acquirors agree that the Elan Companies
will continue to honor all government and commercial chargeback agreements for
the forty-five (45) day period immediately following the Closing (the "Interim
Chargeback Period") and the Elan Companies shall endeavor to terminate each such
agreement with respect to the Products at the end of the Interim Chargeback
Period. The Elan Companies shall be responsible, at their sole cost and expense,
for the processing, payment, administration and support for all chargebacks and
administrative fees owed under these agreements with wholesaler invoice dates
within the Interim Chargeback Period. On the first Business Day following the
Closing, the Elan Companies will issue a letter to the trade (wholesalers and
distributors) and to government and commercial chargeback customers advising
such customers of the Elan Companies' responsibili-


                                      -54-
<PAGE>
ties in connection with government and commercial chargeback agreements and
associated chargebacks and administrative fees. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 8.08, in the event the Elan Companies are
unable to terminate the government and commercial chargeback agreements at the
expiration of the Interim Chargeback Period, the Acquirors shall reimburse the
Elan Companies for the payment of chargebacks made by the Elan Companies after
the expiration of the Interim Chargeback Period.

            (ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 8.08, the parties acknowledge that the VA National Acquisition Center
must approve the removal of the Products from the Elan Companies Federal Supply
Schedule ("FSS") before the responsibility of processing such rebated is
transferred from the Elan Companies to the Acquiror. Accordingly, in the event
such approval is not obtained prior to the applicable Interim Chargeback Date,
the Elan Companies shall continue to be responsible for processing the FSS
chargebacks on the Acquirors' behalf, and the Acquirors shall reimburse the Elan
Companies for the same.

            (iii) The Elan Companies shall provide the Acquirors with all
information relating to the Products and the prices thereof, which the Acquirors
need in order to comply with applicable rules and regulations relating to P.L.
102-585 as it relates to the FSS and Section 340B of the Public Health Services
Act. When requested, such information shall be provided by the Elan Companies to
the Acquirors promptly, and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after
any Acquiror's written request thereof.

            (e)   Promptly following the Closing, the Acquirors will be
responsible for receiving and processing customer orders and for shipping and
invoicing customers for the Products. Promptly following the Closing, the
Parties will jointly issue a letter to customers within the trade (wholesalers
and distributors) notifying such customers that all future Product orders are to
placed with the Acquirors, and providing the appropriate contact information for
the Acquirors' personnel.

            (f)   In the event that the Acquirors increase the published
Wholesaler Acquisition Cost ("WAC") of any of the Products during the applicable
Interim Rebate Period, the Acquirors shall (i) promptly notify the Elan
Companies of such increase and (ii) reimburse the Elan Companies the difference
between the previous WAC and such new increased WAC as it pertains to returns
and the affected rebates, chargebacks and administrative fees.

            SECTION 8.09. Indigent Patient Program. The Elan Companies shall,
through their subcontractor, continue to process claims for the Products under
the Indigent Patient Program until the Closing Date.

            SECTION 8.10. Employee Matters. (a) Effective as of the Closing, the
Acquirors shall offer to employ on an at-will basis each of the primary-care
business unit field sales force and management personnel and internal Elan
personnel dedicated to the Businesses, in each case as set forth on Schedule
8.10 of the Elan Disclosure Sched-


                                      -55-
<PAGE>
ule (collectively, the "Employees") who is actively employed as of the Closing,
in each case with substantially the same responsibilities and duties and at a
total base salary plus target bonus opportunity or hourly rate not less than the
total base salary plus target bonus opportunity or hourly rate then applicable
to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing, with such employment to
commence as of the Closing. Such offers of employment shall be delivered to
applicable Employees prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Section 8.10(a),
an Employee will be treated as "actively employed" if as of the Closing such
person is actively at work, or on vacation, holiday, jury duty, military leave,
sick leave (not including short-term or long-term disability) or bereavement
leave. In addition, each Employee who as of the Closing is not actively employed
but is on an approved leave of absence (other than long-term disability), and
who within 120 days following the Closing presents himself or herself to the
Acquirors as ready to commence active employment with the Acquirors, shall at
such time also be offered employment on an at-will basis on the terms set forth
above. The Acquirors shall not be required to offer to employ any Employee who
(i) is on long-term disability as of the Closing or (ii) is on short-term
disability as of the Closing and goes on long-term disability prior to returning
to active employment with the Elan Companies. Except as specifically provided in
this Section 8.10(a), Acquirors shall determine in their sole discretion the
terms and conditions of employment to be offered to Employees. Effective as of
the Closing, the Elan Companies shall terminate the employment of each Employee
who receives an offer of employment from the Acquirors in accordance with this
Section 8.10(a). Each Employee who becomes employed by the Acquirors is herein
referred to as a "Hired Employee".

            (b)   Effective as of the Closing (or on any later date of hire by
the Acquirors in the case of an Employee not actively employed at the Closing),
all Employees shall cease participation in all Employee Benefit Plans subject to
the terms of such plans.

            (c)   Effective as of the Closing (or on any later date of hire by
the Acquirors in the case of an Employee not actively employed at the Closing),
Employees who are participants in the Elan 401(k) Savings Plan ("Elan's 401(k)
Plan") shall cease to be eligible for any future contributions to Elan's 401(k)
Plan except with respect to compensation from the Elan Companies prior to the
Closing and as provided under Elan's 401(k) Plan, and shall be entitled to a
distribution of their account balances under Elan's 401(k) Plan in accordance
with such plan and as permitted by the Code. Hired Employees who receive an
eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the
Code, including a direct transfer of an eligible rollover distribution within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from Elan's 401(k) Plan shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 402 of the Code, be permitted to make a
rollover contribution to a defined contribution plan of the Acquirors
("Acquiror's Defined Contribution Plan"); provided, however, that the Acquirors
are reasonably satisfied (consistent with the regulations promulgated under
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) that Elan's 401(k) Plan meets the requirements
of Section 401(a) of the Code.

            (d)   As of the Closing, the Acquirors shall, with respect to their
vacation, 401(k) and other employee benefit plans, policies, programs or
arrangements that contain a service credit component and that are maintained by
the Acquirors after the Closing (solely to


                                      -56-
<PAGE>
the extent applicable to such Hired Employee), credit each Hired Employee with
the applicable service credited for such Hired Employee's duration of employment
by the Elan Companies (or any predecessor to the Elan Companies) for purposes of
their Employee Benefit Plans.

            (e)   Hired Employees shall be eligible to enroll in a health plan
determined by the Acquirors as of the Closing without (i) any waiting periods,
(ii) any evidence of insurability or (iii) application of any pre-existing
physical or mental condition restrictions, except to the extent that such
waiting periods, evidence of insurability or pre-existing mental or physical
condition restrictions would apply under the applicable Elan Companies' medical
benefit plan and be permitted by Law. Without limiting the generality of Section
3.01(b)(ix) and Section 3.01(b)(x), the Elan Companies shall retain
responsibility for all payment of benefits under its medical benefit plan to
Hired Employees (and their eligible dependents) for claims incurred prior to
Closing. The Acquirors shall be responsible for claims for medical benefits
incurred by each Hired Employee (and his or her dependents) on or after each
such Hired Employee's date of hire by the Acquirors under the Acquirors' medical
benefit plan applicable to the Hired Employees. For purposes of the preceding
sentences, a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which
medical or other treatment or service was rendered and not the date of inception
of the related illness or injury or the date of submission of a claim related
thereto. The Acquirors shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all expenses incurred by each Hired Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the date of hire by the Acquirors
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Hired Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be
eligible to participate after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
Section 3.01(b)(ix) and Section 3.01(b)(x), the Elan Companies and their
Affiliates shall retain sole responsibility for all Liabilities in respect of
continuation coverage of health insurance under Section 4980B of the Code or
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or other similar state or local law to Employees and
any other current and former employees of the Elan Companies and their
Affiliates and their eligible dependents with respect to "qualifying events" (as
defined in Section 4980B of the Code) occurring on or prior to the Closing.

            (f)   The Acquirors and the Elan Companies expressly acknowledge and
agree that the Acquirors shall be obligated, in respect of any Hired Employee
whose employment is involuntarily terminated by the Acquirors within six months
following the Closing, to pay all amounts and benefits that the Elan Companies
would have been required to pay under the Elan U.S. Severance Plan (the "Elan
Severance Plan") had the Elan Companies retained such Hired Employee as of the
Closing and terminated such Hired Employee on the date terminated by the
Acquirors so long as (x) such Hired Employee's employment was terminated under
circumstances entitling such Hired Employee to severance benefits under the
terms of the Elan Severance Plan as in effect on the date hereof, and (y) such
Hired Employee executes a valid waiver and release in substantially the same
form as the Waiver and Release Agreement (as defined in the Elan Severance Plan)
which remains unrevoked by such Hired Employee for the applicable seven-day
revocation period provided therein. Nothing in this Sec-


                                      -57-
<PAGE>
tion 8.10 shall be construed as limiting the Acquirors' right to terminate any
Hired Employee at any time, with or without cause. The Elan Companies shall have
no Liability or obligation with respect to severance benefits that may become
payable under any severance benefit plan or arrangement of the Acquirors
applicable to Hired Employees.

            (g)   The Acquirors shall be responsible for all Liabilities,
obligations, costs, claims, proceedings and demands, under the WARN Act, or any
state plant closing or notification law, or similar Law in other jurisdictions,
arising out of, or relating to, (i) in respect of Employees, the failure of the
Acquirors to offer employment to Employees in accordance with Section 8.10(a),
or (ii) in respect of Hired Employees, any actions taken by the Acquirors or
their Affiliates after Closing; provided, however, that the Acquirors shall not
be responsible for any such Liabilities, obligations, costs, claims, proceedings
and demands to or in respect of any employees of the Elan Companies other than
the Employees.

            (h)   The Elan Companies shall make pro rata bonus payments (the
"Stub Period Bonus") to Hired Employees in respect of each quarterly, annual or
other applicable performance period under the relevant Employee Benefit Plans
that has not yet been completed as of the Closing (each such period, the
"Performance Period"). Such Stub Period Bonuses shall be computed under the
terms of the applicable bonus plan, consistent with past practice. The Stub
Period Bonus shall be paid to the Hired Employees as soon as practicable
following the Closing and the determination of such amounts.

            (i)   Following the date of this Agreement, the Elan Companies shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Acquirors with all
information and data reasonably requested by the Acquirors in connection with
the Acquirors' rights and obligations under this Section 8.10, including
exchanging information and data relating to employee benefits and employee
benefit plan coverages (except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law).

            SECTION 8.11. Bulk Transfer Laws. The Acquirors hereby waive
compliance by the Elan Companies and their respective Subsidiaries with the
provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Acquirors.

            SECTION 8.12. Covenant Not to Compete. (a) For a period of three (3)
years following the Closing Date (the "Applicable Period"), neither the Elan
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor its or their respective successors or
assigns nor any of its or their respective agents acting on their behalf, shall
engage, license or assist another to engage (which restriction with respect to
assisting others will commence on the Original Agreement Date) in the marketing,
distribution or sale of (i) Skelaxin, any Skelaxin Product Improvement or any
Generic Skelaxin in the Skelaxin Territory or (ii) Sonata, any Sonata Line
Extension, or any Generic Sonata in the Sonata Territory (each, a "Competing
Product"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Elan Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries signs a definitive agreement with respect to a merger or
acquisition by which such Person would acquire rights (other than


                                      -58-
<PAGE>
residual financial rights) in a Competing Product at any time during the
Applicable Period, then such Person (or the entity which acquired such Person or
into which such Person has merged) shall have nine (9) months from the closing
of such definitive agreement to divest itself of such rights in the Competing
Product (unless the Acquirors agree in writing that such divestiture is not
required) and, during such nine (9) month period, the manufacture, promotion,
marketing and/or sale of such Competing Product shall not be in violation of
this Section 8.12. In the case of divestiture under the preceding sentence, such
divestiture can occur by either (x) an outright sale of all rights in the
Competing Product to a third party or (y) an out-license to a third party
(exclusive as to the Elan Parent and its Subsidiaries, except that the Elan
Parent and its Subsidiaries may continue manufacturing the Competing Product for
the licensee for a reasonable period of time) of the right to make, have made,
use, sell, offer for sale and import such Competing Product; provided, however,
that the Elan Parent and its Subsidiaries may only retain residual financial
rights to such Competing Product and must not exercise or have the ability to
exercise any role or influence in any manner over the performance of any
clinical trials with respect to such Competing Product, or the sale, offering
for sale or other promotion of such Competing Product.

            (b)   In addition, no Elan Company will solicit any Hired Employee
of the Acquirors or their Subsidiaries for the purpose of having any such
employee terminate his or her employment with the Acquirors or their
Subsidiaries for a period of two years following the Closing Date; provided,
however, that this Section 8.12(b) shall not prohibit general solicitations of
or advertisement for employment by the Elan Companies that are not generally
directed at Hired Employees.

            (c)   It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained in this Section 8.12 is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
applicable Law, such provision shall be construed and interpreted or reformed so
as to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area,
time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as

acknowledges, however, that this Section 8.12 has been negotiated by the parties
and that the geographical and time limitations on activities, are reasonable in
light of the circumstances pertaining to the parties.

            (d)   In the event of any breach or threatened breach by of any
provision of this Section 8.12, the other party shall be entitled to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief restraining such party from competing or
soliciting in violation of this Section 8.12. Such relief shall be in addition
to and not in lieu of any other remedies that may be available, including an
action for the recovery of Damages.

            (e)   For the avoidance of doubt, if any Person acquires Control of
the Elan Parent, whether by stock purchase, merger or other transaction, no
provision of this Sec-


                                      -59-

tion 8.12 shall apply to such acquiror or its Affiliates other than the Elan
Parent and its Subsidiaries but this Section 8.12 shall continue to apply to the
Elan Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Elan Parent and
its Subsidiaries may transfer drug delivery technologies or any other assets to
such acquiror even if such acquiror uses such assets in a Competing Product, so
long as the drug delivery technologies or other assets transferred by the Elan
Parent and its Subsidiaries do not themselves comprise a Competing Product.

            (f)   After the Closing, the Elan Companies shall not sell Skelaxin
to any Person that the Elan Companies believe will resell such Skelaxin in the
Skelaxin Territory. After the Closing, the King Companies shall not sell
Skelaxin to any Person (other than the Elan Companies) that the King Companies
believe will resell such Skelaxin outside of the Skelaxin Territory.

            SECTION 8.13. Further Assurances. (a) On and after the Closing Date,
the Elan Companies shall from time to time, at the request of the Acquirors,

marketable title to the Purchased Assets (including assistance in the collection
or reduction to possession of any of the Purchased Assets).

            (b)   On and after the Closing Date, the Acquirors shall from time
to time, at the request of the Elan Companies, take such actions as the Elan
Companies may reasonably request, in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Acquirors' assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities.

            SECTION 8.14. HSR Act and Irish Competition Act Filings. (a) The
Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors and the Elan Companies shall each: (i) take
promptly following the Original Agreement Date all actions necessary to make the

Competition Act, but in any event within fourteen (14) Business Days after the
Original Agreement Date; (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any
request for additional information or documentary material received by such

            (a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants of
the parties contained herein, each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust
Law. If any administrative, judicial or legislative Action or Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the sale and purchase of
any of the Purchased Assets or any other transaction as violative of any
antitrust Law, each party shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action or Proceeding, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets or any other
transaction contemplated under this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the
Wyeth/Elan Agreements and the Wyeth/King Agreements.

            (b) Each party shall promptly inform the other parties of any
material communication received by such party from the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Irish Competition
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement,
the Related Agreements, the Wyeth/Elan Agreements and the Wyeth/King Agreements.
Each party shall advise the other parties promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements that such party proposes to make or enter into with
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Irish Competition Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Wyeth/Elan
Agreements and the Wyeth/King Agreements.

            SECTION 8.15. Elan Companies' Right of Reference. The Acquirors
shall grant the Elan Companies and any of their respective Subsidiaries a right
of cross-reference or right of reference, including as that term is defined in
21 C.F.R. Section 314.3(b), to all existing Skelaxin Governmental Permits, Drug
Master Files ("DMFs") or other regulatory submissions relating to Skelaxin as is
necessary to support research, development, regulatory registration,
manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of Skelaxin and Current
Skelaxin Product Improvements outside of the Skelaxin Territory. The Acquirors
shall provide a signed statement to this effect, if requested by any of the Elan
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in accordance with 21 C.F.R.
Section 314.50(g)(3). The Acquirors shall keep the Skelaxin Governmental Permits
and DMFs up-to-date in the Skelaxin Territory, and shall inform the Elan
Companies prior to any modifications in order to permit the Elan Companies to
amend or supplement any affected regulatory application or file relating to
Skelaxin outside of the Territory. At the Elan Companies' or any of their
respective Subsidiaries' request and expense, the Acquirors shall provide a copy
of any regulatory application or file relating to Skelaxin that is the subject
of a right of cross-reference or right of reference pursuant to this Section
8.15.

            SECTION 8.16. Litigation Substitution. (a) The King Companies agree
and acknowledge that, promptly after the Closing, the applicable King Companies
shall be substituted as the plaintiff in Case No. EDNY 03 CV 0006, Elan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eon

                                      -61-
<PAGE>
Labs, Inc., pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York and Case No. 03-1013, Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Corepharma, LLC,
pending in the District of New Jersey, and in any other litigations filed by EPI
prior to the Closing in response to any certifications filed by any third party
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Section 355(b)(2)(A) or Section 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) relating
to the Purchased Assets (the "Patent Litigations"). The Acquirors and EPI will
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish such
substitution(s) as soon as possible following the Closing. In the event that,
for whatever reason, a King Company cannot be substituted as plaintiff in the
Patent Litigations, the parties agree that a King Company shall be the lead
plaintiff in the Patent Litigations (with the rights and duties customarily
associated therewith). From the Closing through and including the earlier to
occur of (x) a Skelaxin Adverse Determination Event or (y) the payment by the
Acquirors of the additional Purchase Price in respect of the Skelaxin Assets set
forth in Section 4.06, the Acquirors shall not settle or compromise the Patent
Litigations, if such settlement or compromise would reasonably be likely to
result in a Skelaxin Adverse Determination Event on or before December 31, 2003,
without the prior written consent of EPI. The Elan Companies shall cooperate
with the King Companies in all respects regarding the Skelaxin Proceedings (as
defined in the Joint Litigation and Prosecution Agreement), including without
limitation any Patent Litigation and all decisions with respect to the filing
and prosecution of any Patent Litigations, including without limitation any
decision regarding whether or not, and when, to respond to any such
certification and/or initiate any particular Patent Litigation, to the extent
permitted by relevant privileges and work product, written agreements and prior
orders in the matter affecting confidentiality of information. EPI will
cooperate reasonably with the King Companies in a full and complete transition
of activity in all Patent Litigations, including sharing with the King Companies
documents reasonably necessary to accomplish the transition, to the extent
permitted by relevant privileges and work product, written agreements and prior
orders in the matter affecting confidentiality of information, making all
persons, documents and things in the possession or control of EPI available to
King Companies for use in connection with, or to provide testimony regarding,
the Patent Litigations. King Companies and EPI shall bear their own expenses in
the conduct of the Patent Litigations and in carrying out their obligations
under this Section 8.16, including fees of their own attorneys.

            (b) To the extent EPI is subject to third party discovery in any of
the Patent Litigations following the substitution of such Acquiror, EPI shall
have the right to be represented by independent counsel; provided, however, that
EPI shall coordinate and cooperate with such Acquiror in the conduct of the
Patent Litigations. Each of such Acquiror and, subject to the foregoing, EPI, to
the extent involved as a third party in any of the Patent Litigations or in any
future litigation or proceeding involving Skelaxin, shall retain the right to
make its own independent judgments in all matters on all issues in connection
with such Patent Litigations and any such future litigation or proceeding
involving Skelaxin; provided, however, that EPI shall obtain such Acquiror's
prior consent before asserting any position, argument or defense, or filing any
motion or other pleading; and provided further, however, that EPI shall not
assert any position, argument or defense in any litigation or proceeding that
may be contrary or detrimental to the position, argument or defense asserted by
such Acquiror, nor refrain from asserting any position, argument or defense that
is contrary or detri-


                                      -62-
<PAGE>
mental to the position, argument or defense opposed by such Acquiror. EPI hereby
expressly conveys to such Acquiror the right to sue for the past infringement by
Eon Labs, Inc., and all other defendants in the Patent Litigations or otherwise,
or by any third party in connection with the patents which are the subject of
this Agreement.

            (c) Such Acquiror hereby acknowledges that EPI is under no
obligation to provide such Acquiror with any information protected by the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product immunity. Unless otherwise
agreed by EPI and such Acquiror, (a) in the event that EPI inadvertently
produces information known to such Acquiror to be privileged or work product, or
which is subsequently identified as such, such Acquiror shall not disclose that
information to any third party, including, but not limited to, any governmental
or judicial body, or use that information in any manner whatsoever, absent an
Order to do so, (b) to the extent such information is contained in documents or
things, such Acquiror shall return such documents or things to EPI, and (c)
prior to disclosing or using any such privileged or work product information
pursuant to an administrative or court order, such Acquiror shall make all
commercially reasonable efforts to provide EPI with a reasonable opportunity to
intervene and participate and oppose the order.

            (d) This Agreement shall not create any agency or similar
relationship between such Acquiror and EPI regarding the Patent Litigations.
Unless otherwise agreed by EPI and the Acquiror, no party shall have the
authority to waive any applicable privilege or immunity on behalf of any other
party; nor shall any waiver of an applicable privilege or immunity by the
conduct of any party be construed to apply to any other party. The parties
understand that this Agreement does not create any attorney-client relationship
between the parties. EPI and such Acquiror will mutually discuss whether a
common interest or joint defense privilege is appropriate for the transition in
the Patent Litigations and enter into any agreements necessary or helpful, in
the reasonable judgment of both EPI and such Acquiror, to facilitate such
Acquiror's assumption, control and continued prosecution of the Patent
Litigations.

            SECTION 8.17. Cooperation Regarding Financial Statements. In the
event that the Acquirors are required to include any audited financial
statements with respect to the Businesses in any filing to be made by the
Acquiror under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the
Wyeth/Elan Agreements or the Wyeth/King Agreements, the Elan Companies shall,
beginning promptly after the date of this Agreement, (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Acquirors with the financial statements and
other information and documents pertaining to the Businesses that the Acquirors
will be required by applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission to include in its filings; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, such financial statements and other information
shall be delivered to the Acquirors no later than 60 days following the Closing
Date, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the accountants for
the Elan Companies to deliver such information

                                      -63-
<PAGE>
and provide access to files and work papers in connection therewith as the
Acquirors may reasonably request.

            SECTION 8.18. No Solicitation. (a) Notwithstanding any waivers given
by Acquiror Parent to the Elan Companies prior to the date hereof, from and
after the date hereof and up to and including the Termination Date, without the
prior written consent of the Acquirors, no Elan Company will authorize or permit
any representative or employee of any Elan Company to (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or
take any other action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person, (ii) engage in any discussion or
negotiation relating thereto or furnish information with respect to the Elan
Companies in connection therewith, except as may be required in the exercise by
it of its fiduciary duties under applicable law after receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal which was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 8.18(a); provided, however, that the Elan Companies shall furnish
copies of any such information to the Acquirors contemporaneously with the
furnishment to any such Person (which furnishment to such Person shall be
subject to a customary confidentiality agreement), or (iii) accept or agree to
accept any Acquisition Proposal. If any Elan Company receives any such
inquiries, offers or proposals it shall promptly notify the Acquirors orally and
in writing of such event. If any Elan Company receives an Acquisition Proposal,
such Elan Company shall promptly notify the Acquirors in writing after the
receipt thereof (including providing a copy thereof in writing), the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal. Such Elan Company also shall promptly notify the
Acquirors of any change to or modification of such Acquisition Proposal. As used
herein, "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer (other than pursuant
to this Agreement) to acquire in any manner an ownership interest in any part of
the Businesses or the Products.

            (b) Except as may be required in the exercise by them of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, none of the governing bodies of any of
the Elan Companies nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror Parent or the
Acquirors, the approval or recommendation by such governing body or any such
committee of this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the Wyeth/Elan
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any such action taken in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) or
(ii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

            SECTION 8.19. Medical Inquiries and Complaints. The parties will
negotiate in good faith to jointly develop written procedures for the
administration of, and response to, medical inquiries or complaints concerning
Skelaxin by consumers, physicians, pharmacists and other health care
professionals, as soon as practicable, but such written procedures shall be in
place no later than 30 days after the Closing Date. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions thereof with
respect to Skelaxin. Not-


                                      -64-
<PAGE>
withstanding the foregoing or the joint written procedures, the Acquirors shall
exclusively have the right to determine how to respond to medical inquiries and
complaints in the Skelaxin Territory and the Elan Companies shall have such
exclusive right outside the Skelaxin Territory.

            SECTION 8.20. Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement; Wyeth/Elan Master
Agreement. At the Closing, (a) EPIL or its designee shall assign its rights and
obligations under the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement to the applicable Acquiror in
accordance with the terms of the proviso of the first sentence of Section 8.01
of the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement; provided, however, that from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing Date, the Elan Companies shall take all actions
necessary to be in compliance with Section 9.3 of the Distribution and
Co-Promotion Agreement and (b) the Elan Parent and EPIL shall assign their
rights under the Wyeth/Elan Master Agreement to the applicable Acquiror in
accordance with the terms of the proviso of the first sentence of Section 9.1
thereof.

            SECTION 8.21. Pharma Marketing Settlement Agreement. From the date
of this Agreement until the Closing, each of the Elan Companies shall take, or
cause to be taken, all action, or do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under the Pharma Marketing Settlement Agreement in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Pharma
Marketing Settlement Agreement and to cause the conditions to the obligations of
the other parties thereto to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby to
be satisfied at or prior to the Closing. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, none of the Elan Companies shall take any action, or fail to take
any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause a breach by the Elan
Companies under the Pharma Marketing Settlement Agreement. The Elan Companies
shall take all necessary action to cause Axogen Limited to comply with the
foregoing.

            SECTION 8.22. Distribution and Co-Promotion Agreement. The Elan
Companies shall terminate the Distribution and Co-Promotion Agreement upon the
Closing.

            SECTION 8.23. Skelaxin License. (a) The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that, subject to the terms of this Agreement and except as otherwise
set forth in this Section 8.23, solely with respect to use and end users outside
of the Skelaxin Territory, the Elan Companies have retained, and do not grant to
the Acquirors, any right the Elan Companies may have to make, have made, use,
sell, offer for sale, import, develop, distribute, market and otherwise
commercialize Skelaxin or any Skelaxin Product Improvement outside of the
Skelaxin Territory. To the extent applicable, and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Acquirors hereby grant to the Elan Companies a non-exclusive,
paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license, with the
right of sublicense, under the Skelaxin Assets to: (i) make, use, sell, offer to
sell Skelaxin in or import Skelaxin into, countries outside of the Skelaxin
Territory, but only to and for use by end users who are outside of the Skelaxin
Territory; (ii) within the Skelaxin Territory, make and have made Skelaxin for
use, sale or export outside the Skelaxin Territory, but only to and for use by
end users who are outside of the Skelaxin Territory; and (iii) conduct such
studies and trials within and without the

                                      -65-
<PAGE>
Skelaxin Territory as may be necessary or useful for the Elan Companies, solely
outside the Skelaxin Territory, to obtain regulatory approval with respect to
Skelaxin. The license to the Elan Companies provided for under this Section 8.23
shall be assignable only upon the prior written consent of the Acquiror Parent
and the Elan Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); provided, however, that the rights and obligations provided for by
this Section 8.23 may be assigned, in whole or in part, on a country by country
or world-wide basis, without such consent, to a person or entity who purchases
all or substantially all of the Elan Companies' interest in Skelaxin in such
country or the world.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.23 to the contrary,
the Elan Companies agree and acknowledge that the Acquirors shall have the right
to conduct such studies and trials outside the Skelaxin Territory as may be
necessary or useful for the Acquirors, solely in the Skelaxin Territory, to
obtain regulatory approval with respect to Skelaxin and the Elan Companies
hereby grant to the Acquirors a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual
and irrevocable right and license under any patent or patent application within
the Elan Companies' control which claims Skelaxin to, outside of the Skelaxin
Territory, make, have made and use Skelaxin solely in connection with such
studies and trials. The Elan Companies hereby further grant to the Acquirors a
non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and
license outside the Skelaxin Territory to make and have made Skelaxin for use,
sale in and export to the Skelaxin Territory, but only to and for use by end
users who are within the Skelaxin Territory. The license to the Acquirors
provided for under this Section 8.23 shall be assignable only upon the prior
written consent of the Elan Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that the rights and
obligations provided for by this Section 8.23 may be assigned, in whole or in
part, on a country by country or world-wide basis, without such consent, to a
person or entity who purchases all or substantially all of the Acquirors'
interest in Skelaxin in the Skelaxin Territory.

            (c) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the parties
hereto shall meet to coordinate all aspects of material logistics relating to
the commercialization and supply of Skelaxin outside of the Skelaxin Territory,
including, but not limited to, procedures relating to regulatory compliance
matters and clinical coordination associated with the supply of Skelaxin outside
of the Skelaxin Territory. The Elan Companies, solely with respect to use or end
users outside of the Skelaxin Territory, may purchase their reasonable
requirements for Skelaxin manufactured by the Acquirors for delivery outside of
the Skelaxin Territory, but only upon such on terms and conditions, including
price, as are acceptable to both parties hereto. Subject to applicable legal
requirements, the King Companies may affix labeling on Skelaxin sold to the Elan
Companies for purposes of sale outside of the Skelaxin Territory indicating that
such Skelaxin may not be resold in the Skelaxin Territory. Following the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to apply for a new NDC
code to be applicable to sales of Skelaxin outside of the Skelaxin Territory and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such NDC code to be issued as
promptly as practicable.

                                      -66-
<PAGE>
            SECTION 8.24. NanoCrystal Technology. Upon the Closing and
immediately following the execution and delivery of the Development Agreement,
and subject solely to the Elan Companies' contractual obligations existing as of
the date of this Agreement, the Development Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to strike the term "NanoCrystal Technology" (as that term is defined in
the Wyeth/Elan Development Agreement) from the definition of "Excluded
Technology" and all of the licenses and rights granted to Purchaser therein
shall be deemed to include the NanoCrystal Technology. During the period from
execution of this Agreement to the Closing, if any, Elan shall not take any
actions which would prevent use of the NanoCrystal Technology to conduct any of
the activities or preclude a grant to the Acquirors of any of the rights or
licenses contemplated by the Development Agreement with respect to the
NanoCrystal Technology. The Acquirors acknowledge that Elan may, prior to or
after the Closing, sell, license or transfer the NanoCrystal Technology
intellectual property or sell or transfer the business encompassing the
NanoCrystal Technology; provided, however, that any such sale, license or
transfer shall require any subsequent purchaser, licensee or transferee to
expressly acknowledge and abide by the obligations of this Section 8.24 and the
Development Agreement as it relates to the NanoCrystal Technology.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Development Agreement, Elan makes no
representations and warranties with respect to the commercial or technical
suitability, patentability or intellectual property regarding or arising out of
the application or use of NanoCrystal Technology, particularly with reference to
a reformulation of zaleplon. In the event of a conflict between this provision
and the Development Agreement, this provision shall govern.

            SECTION 8.25. Additional Skelaxin Formulations. (a) Subject to
Elan's contractual obligations existing as of the execution hereof, Elan and the
Acquirors shall initiate a development program to reformulate the current dosage
form of Skelaxin either as a pharmaceutical combination containing metaxalone
and another active ingredient or as a new formulation comprising metaxalone
using drug delivery technology within Elan's Control (including, without
limitation, as applicable, Elan's PRODAS(R), SODAS(R) technology or NanoCrystal
Technology) (a "Modified Release Skelaxin"). Elan shall conduct preliminary
studies in support of such development as soon as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement and any expenses incurred by Elan between execution
of this Agreement and the Closing as a result of the activities contemplated by
this Section 8.25 shall be paid by the Acquirors upon either the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto shall
discuss the status of the preliminary development work provided for herein. As
soon as reasonably practicable following execution hereof, but in no event more
than three (3) months after a Closing, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith and execute a separate formulation agreement which shall contain the
economic and other terms provided for on Schedule 8.25 of the Elan Disclosure
Schedule (the "Skelaxin Formulation Agreement"). The activities contemplated by
this Section 8.25 or the execution of any agreements relating to a Modified
Release Skelaxin shall not be a condition to a Closing.

            (b) Until the execution of the Skelaxin Formulation Agreement and in
accordance with its terms, as to any Modified Release Skelaxin, regardless of
the Acquirors' ownership of any Purchased Assets constituting a Current Skelaxin
Product Improvement, the

                                      -67-
<PAGE>
Elan Companies shall not be deemed to have granted to the Acquirors any license
to any other patent or patent application, regulatory approval rights,
manufacturing know-how or other proprietary right that may be required to make,
have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export or otherwise commercialize
such a Modified Release Skelaxin.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.25 to the contrary
and except as set forth in the Skelaxin Formulation Agreement, a Modified
Release Skelaxin and any method of making, having made, using, selling, offering
for sale or importing a Modified Release Skelaxin, solely for the purposes of
Section 8.12, shall constitute a Skelaxin Product Improvement.

            SECTION 8.26. Annual Adjustment Amount. The Elan Companies hereby
agree to pay to the Acquirors the portion of the Annual Adjustment Amount (as
defined in the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement) that relates to the period from
January 1, 2003 through and including the Amendment and Restatement Effective
Date (as defined in the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement) promptly after the
Acquirors have paid such Annual Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of
the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement and delivered to the Elan Companies a copy of
the officer's certificate referred to in such Section 2.01(b). The Acquirors
agree to provide the Elan Companies with the audit rights with respect to such
certificate as is provided to the Supplier (as defined in the Wyeth/Elan Supply
Agreement) pursuant to Section 5.01(c) of the Wyeth/Elan Supply Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                        CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF
                       THE ELAN COMPANIES FOR THE CLOSING

            The obligation of the Elan Companies to effect the Closing is

material respects all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement or any
Related Agreement to be performed by them prior to or on the Closing Date, and
the Elan Companies shall have received a certificate to such effect dated the

the Acquirors), at or before the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

            SECTION 10.01. Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations and warranties of the Elan Companies contained in this Agreement

representation and

                                      -69-

shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and the Elan Companies shall
have performed in all material respects all agreements and covenants required by
this Agreement or any Related Agreement to be performed by them prior to or on
the Closing Date, and the Acquirors shall have received a certificate to such
effect dated the Closing Date and executed by a duly authorized officer of each

            SECTION 10.02. No Actions or Proceedings. No Orders prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the
Wyeth/Elan Agreements and the Wyeth/King Agreements shall have been instituted

the Related Agreements, the Wyeth/Elan Agreements and the Wyeth/King Agreements.
The parties shall have received any clearance that may be required under the HSR

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            SECTION 11.01. Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants,
Etc. The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements to be
performed at or prior to the Closing of the Elan Companies or the Acquiror
Parent and the Acquirors contained in this Agreement and the Related Agreements
shall terminate twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "Expiration
Date"); provided, however, that any claim (i) with respect to a


                                      -70-
<PAGE>
breach of a representation or warranty relating to title to Skelaxin
Intellectual Property, the Sonata Copyrights or the Skelaxin Product
Registrations shall not expire until three (3) years following the Closing Date
and (ii) based upon a breach of a covenant or an agreement contained in this
Agreement or any Related Agreement to be performed after the Closing Date shall
not expire and shall continue in perpetuity. So long as an Indemnified Party
gives an Indemnification Claim Notice for such a claim on or before the
Expiration Date or the applicable date set forth in clause (i) or (ii) above,
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its rights to
indemnification.

            SECTION 11.02. Indemnification. (a) Subject to Sections 11.01 and
11.03, from and after the Closing, the Elan Companies shall jointly and
severally indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror Parent and
the Acquirors, each of their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and
all costs, losses, damages, including natural resource damages, fines,
penalties, judgments, lawsuits, deficiencies, claims and expenses (including
reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and other professionals,
including third-party consultants and, to the extent allowable at Law, medical
monitoring costs and expenses) of every kind and nature (collectively,
"Damages") incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or
incident to (i) any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of an Elan Company made in this Agreement or the Related Agreements or (ii) any
Excluded Liabilities.

            (b) Subject to Sections 11.01 and 11.03, from and after the Closing,
the Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Elan Company, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all Damages
incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i)
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Acquiror
Parent and the Acquirors made in this Agreement or the Related Agreements or
(ii) any Assumed Liabilities (except for any reimbursements actually paid by the
Acquirors to any Elan Company or applicable Subsidiary pursuant to Section
3.01(v)).

            (c) The indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt
written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") of any Damages or discovery
of fact upon which such indemnified party intends to base a request for
indemnification under Section 11.02(a) or Section 11.02(b). Failure to give any
such Indemnification Claim Notice shall not constitute a waiver of any right to
indemnification or reduce in any way the indemnification available hereunder,
except to the extent such failure to notify directly increases the amount to be
indemnified hereunder. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a
description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Damages (to the
extent that the nature and amount of such Damages are known at such time). The
indemnified party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying party copies of all
papers and official documents received in respect of any Damages. All
indemnification claims in respect of a party, its Affiliates or their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Indemnitees" and
each an "Indemnitee") shall be made solely by such party to this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party").

                                      -71-
<PAGE>
            (d) The obligations of an indemnifying party under this Section
11.02 with respect to Damages arising from claims of any third party that are
subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 11.02(a) or Section
11.02(b) (a "Third Party Claim") shall be governed by and be contingent upon the
following additional terms and conditions:

            (i) The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the
      defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to
      fully indemnify the indemnified party therefor in accordance with this
      Agreement, to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected
      by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to the indemnified
      party (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
      Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third
      Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified
      party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in
      connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that in the event
      that a conflict of interest arises between the indemnifying party and its
      Indemnified Party such that such legal counsel cannot represent both the
      indemnifying party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitee may retain
      its own legal counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party and the
      indemnifying party and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnified
      Party and its counsel, as may be reasonably requested. If the indemnifying
      party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
      participate in the defense thereof and to employ at its own expense
      counsel not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party separate from
      the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that
      the indemnifying party shall control such defense, subject to the
      remaining terms of this Section 11.02(d). The indemnifying party shall be
      liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one primary counsel, and to
      the extent reasonably required in connection with such Third Party Claim,
      one or more local counsel, and such other counsel as may be reasonably
      required due to a conflict among indemnified parties, in each case
      employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
      indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. In the event the
      indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
      Indemnified Party shall immediately deliver to the indemnifying party all
      original notices and documents (including court papers) received by any
      Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim. Except as set forth
      above, should the indemnifying party assume the defense of a Third Party
      Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
      or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by
      such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the
      analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.

            (ii) With respect to any Damages relating solely to the payment of
      money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not
      result in the Indemnitee's or the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to
      injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business or
      reputation of the Indemnitee or the Indemnified Party in any manner, and
      as to which the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing the
      obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the indemnifying


                                      -72-
<PAGE>
      party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment,
      enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Damages, on such
      terms as the indemnifying party, in its sole discretion, shall deem
      appropriate; provided, however, that, as a result of or in connection with
      any such settlement each Indemnitee or Indemnified Party shall receive a
      full release with respect to such claim. With respect to all other Damages
      in connection with Third Party Claims or where the indemnified party
      reasonably determines, after consulting its outside counsel, that such
      Damages cannot be separated from any claim for money damages, the
      indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any such
      Third Party Claim and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
      of one primary counsel, and to the extent reasonably required in
      connection with such Third Party Claim, one or more local counsel, and
      such other counsel as may be reasonably required due to a conflict among
      indemnified parties, incurred by the indemnified party in defending such
      Third Party Claim. In any such case, the indemnifying party shall be
      entitled to be consulted about (but not control) the defense of, and
      receive copies of all pleadings and other material papers in connection
      with, any such claim or litigation. If such other Damages can be so
      separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be
      entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages in
      accordance with this Section 11.02(d). The indemnifying party shall not be
      liable for any settlement or other disposition of Damages by an Indemnitee
      or Indemnified Party that is reached without the prior written consent of
      the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
      delayed or conditioned). Regardless of whether the indemnifying party
      chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee or
      Indemnified Party shall admit any Liability with respect to, or settle,
      compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written
      consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
      withheld, delayed or conditioned).

            (iii) Regardless of whether the indemnifying party chooses to defend
      or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party and each
      indemnifying party shall, and shall cause each other Indemnitee or
      Affiliate of any such indemnifying party, as applicable, to, cooperate in
      the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records,
      information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such
      conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
      reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall
      include access during normal business hours afforded to the indemnifying
      party or Indemnified Party, as applicable, to, and reasonable retention by
      each such Person of, records and information that are reasonably relevant
      to such Third Party Claim, and making each such Person and other employees
      and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
      information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the
      indemnifying party shall reimburse each such Person for all its reasonable
      out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.

            (e) In addition, and without giving effect to the provisions of
Sections 11.01 and 11.03, the Elan Companies shall jointly and severally, and
fully and promptly,


                                      -73-
<PAGE>
indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless the King Companies or their
Affiliates, each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns from and against any and all Damages incurred in
connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to any of the King
Companies or their Affiliates being found by a court, tribunal or arbitrator to
be a necessary party in an action, lawsuit, arbitration or other legal
proceeding commenced in accordance with subparagraph 2.2(a) of the Pharma
Marketing Settlement Agreement.

            (f) Any claim by the Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors or their
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by or
opportunity to investigate afforded to the Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors,
nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by the Acquiror Parent's and the
Acquirors' Knowledge on or before the Closing Date of any breach of the type
specified in this Section 11.02 or of any state of facts that may give rise to
such a breach. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect the right to indemnification,
payment of Damages or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations.

            SECTION 11.03. Limitations. (a) In no event shall the Elan Companies
or the Acquiror Parent or the Acquirors be liable for any Damages pursuant to a
claim based upon a representation or warranty or, if the Closing occurs, a
covenant or agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing and pursuant to
Section 11.02(a)(i) or 11.02(b)(i), as applicable, unless and until (i) the
individual claim giving rise to any Damages exceeds $100,000, in which case the
Elan Companies or the Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors, as applicable, shall be
liable for all Damages arising from such claim, (ii) the aggregate amount of all
such Damages exceeds $5,000,000, in which case the Elan Companies or the
Acquiror Parent and the Acquirors, as applicable, shall be liable for all such
Damages only in excess of such amount, and then (iii) not for any amount in
excess of $50,000,000 for all claims made under such Section 11.02(a)(i) or
11.02(b)(i), as applicable, in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this Section 11.03(a) shall not be applicable to any breach of any
representation or warranty by any party attributable to such party's fraud or
willful misrepresentation contained therein.

            (b) The amount of any Damages recoverable by a party under Section
11.02 shall be (i) reduced by (x) the amount of any actual Tax Benefits realized
by the Indemnified Party that result from the Liability that gave rise to such
indemnity and (y) the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to the indemnified
party relating to such claim and (ii) if the Tax Benefits are less than zero,
increased by the amount of any actual net Tax cost (i.e., the excess of the Tax
increases over the Tax savings actually realized by the Indemnified Party)
incurred by the Indemnified Party that results from the receipt of indemnity
payments hereunder (grossed up for income Taxes on the amount of the net Tax
cost).

                                      -74-
<PAGE>
            (c) For purposes of any right to indemnification hereunder, the
representations and warranties of the Elan Companies, the King Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed not qualified by any references
therein to materiality generally or to whether or not any breach would result in
a Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL NOT
EXTEND TO SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

            SECTION 12.01. Methods of Termination. Prior to the Closing, the
transactions contemplated herein may be terminated and/or abandoned at any time:

      to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be
      available to the Elan Companies if their failure to perform in all
      material respects any of their obligations under this Agreement or any
      Related Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to occur by such
      time;

            (c) following (x) the delivery of the Compliance Information to the
      Elan Companies and (y) the Scheduled Shareholder Vote Date, by the

      breached any material obligation hereunder that remains uncured for a

      any representation or warranty or any covenant of the King Companies that

      closing condition set forth in Article IX (and, if prior to the Scheduled
      Shareholder Vote Date, such breach is incapable of cure prior to the
      Scheduled Shareholder Vote Date);

            (k) by the Acquirors if (i) there shall have occurred any breach of
      any representation or warranty or any covenant of the Elan Companies that

<PAGE>
      to any other party to this Agreement, except that nothing in this Section
      12.02 shall prejudice any rights, claims, or causes of action that may

(whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Superior
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Acquirors pursuant to Section 12.01(e) or Section
12.01(g) or (iii) either the Elan Companies or the Acquirors pursuant to Section
12.01(f) and (b) the Elan Companies or their Affiliates shall have entered into
a definitive agreement regarding a transaction with a third party unaffiliated
with the Acquirors involving a sale of any assets, stock (or other equity or
voting interests) or businesses that constitute or represent 50% or more of the
total revenue, operating income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization or assets of the Businesses (whether alone or together with
other assets of the Elan Companies) within 12 months of the date of termination
of this Agreement, then the Elan Companies shall, as a condition to the
execution of such definitive agreement, pay to the Acquirors or their designee a
fee equal to $31,500,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in United States dollars. In the event this
Agreement is terminated by the Acquirors pursuant to Section 12.01(h), the Elan
Companies shall pay to the Acquirors or their designee the Termination Fee
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds in United States dollars
within two (2) Business Days of such termination. As used in this Section 12.03,
the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal on terms
that are more favorable to the shareholders of the Elan Parent than the terms of
this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Wyeth/Elan Agreements and the
Wyeth/King Agreements, taken as a whole. In the event this Agreement is
terminated for any reason (other than pursuant to Section 12.01(f)), the
Original Agreement shall automatically be revived and reinstated immediately
upon such termination as if this amendment and restatement shall not have
occurred and this Agreement shall be void (it being understood that the waiver
by the Acquirors of compliance by the Elan Parties with Section 8.18 of the
Original Agreement shall also automatically be revived and reinstated
immediately upon such termination).

            SECTION 12.04. Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that
the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and specifically identifiable.
Accordingly, the parties further agree and stipulate that, if the Closing does
not occur because of the willful failure of the Elan Companies, on the one hand,
or the Acquirors, on the other hand, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder, (a) monetary damages and any other remedy at law will not be
adequate, (b) the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to specific performance
as the remedy for such breach, (c) each party agrees to waive any objection to
the remedy of


                                      -77-
<PAGE>
specific performance, (d) each party agrees that the granting of specific
performance by any court will not be deemed to be harsh or oppressive to the
party who is ordered specifically to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and (e) in connection with any action for specific performance, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs
of prosecuting or defending such action. The right to seek specific performance
hereunder shall not preclude any party to seek any other remedy at law or in
equity.

            SECTION 12.05. Settled Claims. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that (a) no claims, causes of action or theories of relief (i) the same as those
claims, causes of action or theories of relief alleged or asserted by any of the
King Companies in their Answer and Counterclaims dated April 16, 2003 and their
responses asserted in their Responses and Objections of Defendants to
Plaintiffs' First Set of Interrogatories dated May 1, 2003 or (ii) otherwise
based on the Specified Facts, and (b) no facts (the "Specified Facts") out of
which any of the claims, causes of action, theories of relief or responses set
forth in clause (a)(i) above arose, including, without limitation, the
investigation by the Federal Trade Commission referred to in its letters dated
March 13, 2003 and May 7, 2003 (but only to the extent the King Companies have
Knowledge of the facts and circumstances underlying the initiation of such
investigation), "Study 105", and all claims arising out of any actions taken by
the Elan Companies relating to their relationship with United Research
Laboratories, Inc./Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc., shall, directly or
indirectly, constitute, or form the basis for, a breach by any of the Elan
Companies of any representation and warranty or covenant set forth in this
Agreement or a failure of any condition set forth in Article IX or X of this
Agreement.

no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly

continues to be responsible for all of its obligations hereunder, or (b) to a
Person that (i) purchases all or substantially all of the assets being conveyed
hereunder or (ii) merges with the Acquiror Parent, an Acquiror or the

and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision will be
fully severable, (ii) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom, and (iv) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part
of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar to the
terms of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and
reasonably acceptable to the parties herein.
