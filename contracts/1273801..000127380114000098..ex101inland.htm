ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING; PRE-CLOSING CONSENTS AND WAIVERS

Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale of Hotel Assets; Assumption of Assumed
Liabilities; Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities.

(a)At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Parent shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to sell, assign,
transfer and convey to the applicable Buyer, and such Buyer shall purchase and
acquire from the applicable Selling Subsidiaries, all of such Selling
Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in, to and under the applicable Hotel
Assets, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

(b)At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyers shall assume and become responsible for, and shall pay,
perform and discharge (or cause to be paid, performed and discharged) when
due, the Assumed Liabilities.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the Hotel
Assets shall not include any assets or properties other than those set forth
in the definition of "Hotel Assets" and (ii) at the Closing, neither Buyer
will assume or become responsible for any Excluded Liabilities. 



Section 2.2 Consideration. The aggregate consideration payable by Buyers to
Parent at the Closing for the Hotel Assets shall be the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, together with an amount in cash equal to One Billion
Seventy One Million Dollars ($1,071,000,000.00) (the "Initial Purchase
Price"), which shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, by the amount
of the Prorated Items as of the Closing Date (the amount determined as a
result of the foregoing calculation the "Closing Cash Consideration"). The
Closing Cash Consideration shall be paid by Buyers at the Closing pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) based on the calculation thereof in the Closing Statement, and
it shall be subject to adjustment following the Closing pursuant to Section
2.7(b).

Section 2.3 Deposit; Payment on Closing.

(a)No later than the first (1st) Business Day following the date hereof,
Buyers shall deposit Fifty Million Dollars $50,000,000.00 with the Deposit
Escrow Agent (together with all interest and earnings thereon, the "Deposit").
The Deposit shall be held in a segregated interest-bearing account in
accordance with the provisions of a deposit escrow agreement, substantially in
the form of Exhibit A (the "Deposit Escrow Agreement"). If the Closing occurs,
the Deposit shall be disbursed to Parent at the Closing and shall be applied
against the Closing Cash Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, except in
accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement and the Deposit
Escrow Agreement, the Deposit shall be held by the Deposit Escrow Agent and
shall not be released by the Deposit Escrow Agent unless and until the Closing
occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing does not occur or if
this Agreement otherwise terminates, the Deposit shall be disbursed as
provided in Section 9.2.

(b)No later than 4:00 P.M. New York City time on the Business Day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, Buyers shall deliver to the Deposit Escrow Agent,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds that portion of the Closing
Cash Consideration (without withholdings of any kind) necessary to defease any
Prepaid Existing Loans that Parent desires to defease at the Closing (such
amount the "Defeasance Amount"), which Defeasance Amount shall be notified by
Parent to Buyers on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date and
shall be held in escrow by the Deposit Escrow Agent, pending its release on
the Closing Date in accordance with this Section 2.3(b). On the Closing Date,
Buyers shall deliver to the Deposit Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Closing Cash Consideration (less the Deposit
and the Defeasance Amount), without witholdings of any kind, to be disbursed
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section 2.3. Without limiting the
foregoing, but in furtherance thereof, Buyers and Parent hereby agree that on
the Closing Date (so long as all of the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the Closing as set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived as of such date (other than conditions with respect to
actions the Parties shall take at the Closing itself or which, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
of such conditions at the Closing)), the Deposit Escrow Agent shall be
instructed to disburse the Closing Cash Consideration in accordance with the
Closing Statement approved by Buyers and Parent in accordance with Section 2.4
and prepared consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Parent and Buyers
agree that a portion of the Closing Cash Consideration shall be used to pay
the Lenders in respect of the Prepaid Existing Loans (and after giving effect
to the allocation between Buyers and Parent of any costs or other expenses
related to such prepayment or defeasance pursuant to Section 2.8), in such
amounts as are necessary to fully prepay or defease each such Prepaid Existing
Loan, thereby causing each such Prepaid Existing Loan to terminate as of, and
cease to be in effect from and after, the Closing (unless defeased in which
case such Prepaid Existing Loan will remain outstanding and be assumed by a
successor borrower from and after the Closing). 



Section 2.4 Closing Statement. No later than 2 Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyers for Buyers'
review and approval a statement, setting forth Parent's calculation of the
Closing Cash Consideration (including the components of such calculation
described in the definition thereof), and attaching the Estimated Proration
Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(b) (collectively with such attachment, the
"Closing Statement"). In the event that Buyers object to all or any portion of
the Closing Statement (other than the Estimated Proration Statement, to which
Buyers may not object until after the Closing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.7(b)), Buyers and Parent shall work together in good
faith to agree upon the amounts set forth therein prior to the Closing, but if
the Parties are unable to resolve any such objection, the amount set forth in
the Closing Statement shall control. Following the Closing, any unresolved
disputes with respect to matters set forth in the Closing Statement shall be
resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.7(b).

Section 2.5 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of the Deposit
Escrow Agent located at 30 N. LaSalle Street, Suite 2200, Chicago IL 60602, on
November 17, 2014, so long as all of the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the Closing as set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived as of such date (other than conditions with respect to
actions the Parties shall take at the Closing itself or which, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
of such conditions at the Closing); provided that if all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Closing as set forth in Article
VII (other than conditions with respect to actions the Parties shall take at
the Closing itself or which, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing)
are satisfied or waived prior to November 17, 2014, then the Parties may
consummate the Closing prior to November 17, 2014 if they mutually agree on a
date on which to consummate the Closing (and in the absence of such mutual
agreement, the Closing shall be consummated on November 17, 2014); provided
further that if the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate
the Closing as set forth in Article VII have not been satisfied or waived as
of November 17, 2014, the Closing shall take place on the third Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all such conditions (other than
conditions with respect to actions the Parties shall take at the Closing
itself or which, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but

viii.to the extent required in respect of the Closing pursuant to Section

x.a duly executed tax declaration or similar documents (or counterparts
thereto, as applicable) required to be executed by a "buyer" or "grantee" in
connection with any transfer, stamp, excise or similar tax imposed by the

Section 2.7 Proration Calculation Principles.

(a)The following items (collectively, the "Prorated Items") shall be prorated
between Parent and Buyers as of the Closing Date (on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over the applicable period) in accordance with the
calculation principles set forth below, with the applicable Buyer being deemed
to be the owner of the applicable Hotel Assets transferred at the Closing
during the entire day on the Closing Date and being entitled to receive all
operating income of such Hotel Assets, and being obligated to pay all
operating expenses of such Hotel Assets, with respect to the Closing Date:

i.Buyers shall give Parent a credit at the Closing for the amount of all
accounts receivable, without discount, accruing or arising prior to the
Closing as reflected in the books of Parent (or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary or Manager) or the applicable Buyer that are between zero (0) and
ninety (90) days outstanding ("Non-Stale A/R"). Parent shall be entitled to,
and shall retain the right after the Closing to receive and/or collect, all
accounts receivable for the Hotel Assets that are ninety (90) days or more
outstanding ("Stale A/R"). Buyers shall have no obligation to collect any
accounts receivable and credit card claims that remain ninety (90) days or
more outstanding (all of which shall remain the property of Parent). If either
Party receives any payments after the Closing for any accounts receivable in
connection with the Hotel Assets, such payments shall be applied to the
accounts receivable designated by the payers and, if the payers have not
designated the accounts receivable to which the payments are to be applied,
the payments shall be applied to accounts receivable in their order of
maturity (with the earliest maturity having the highest priority).
Periodically after the Closing (but no less frequently than monthly), (i)
Buyers shall or shall cause the applicable Manager to submit to Parent all
amounts received in respect of Stale A/R, together with an itemization of such
accounts receivable, and (ii) if, after the Closing, any Non-Stale A/R is
received by Parent, a Selling Subsidiary or the Manager under a Terminating
Management Agreement, then Parent shall pay (or, if applicable, use Reasonable
Efforts to cause such Manager to pay) such amounts to the applicable Buyer or
its designee (it being agreed that Buyers shall be entitled to receive all
amounts received by any Party after the Closing on account of the Non-Stale
A/R).

ii.Buyers shall be entitled to all Hotel room, food service, bar, beverage and
liquor revenues and charges and all revenues and charges from restaurant
operations, Hotel banquet and conference facility operations, all revenues
realized from the use of gift cards, gift certificates and similar
instruments, and all other revenue of any kind attributable to any of the same
for the period on and after the applicable Cut-off Time, and Parent shall be
entitled to all such revenues and charges attributable to any period prior to
such Cut-off Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Buyer and
Parent shall each be entitled to one-half (1/2) of the revenue from hotel
rooms at the Hotels being transferred at the Closing, including any parking
charges related thereto, for the night preceding the Closing. Parent shall
deliver to the applicable Buyer or provide the applicable Buyer a credit at
the Closing in an amount equal to all guest reservation deposits held by the
Hotels being transferred at the Closing for guests arriving or staying after
check out time for such Hotels on the Closing Date, less credit card charges,
travel company charges and similar commissions. 



iii.Buyers shall give Parent a credit at the Closing for all petty cash funds
at the Hotels (whether in registers, vaults, safes (other than guest room
safes) or otherwise). Buyers and Parent shall make mutually satisfactory
arrangements for counting such cash and cash equivalents as of the Cut-Off
Time.

iv.Parent agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Manager or Selling Subsidiary
to pay), at or as of the Closing, all Trade Payables which have been invoiced
and are due and owing as of the Closing. With respect to Trade Payables that
are not yet due and payable as of the Closing but which have accrued or relate
to that period on or prior to the Cut-Off Time, the applicable Buyer shall
receive a credit at the Closing in the amount of such Trade Payables and such
Buyer shall be obligated to pay such payables from and after the Closing.
Buyers agree to pay, or cause the applicable Manager to pay, all Trade
Payables from each Hotel which accrue and relate to that period after the Cut-
Off Time, including any Trade Payables for Supplies ordered before the Closing
but delivered to the Hotel on or after the Closing Date.

v.Any amounts prepaid or payable under any Assigned Contracts, and any
advertising expenses, trade association dues and trade subscriptions shall be
prorated at the Closing as of the Closing Date with Parent obligated for all
sums accrued prior to the Cut-Off Time and the applicable Buyer obligated for
all sums accrued after the Cut-Off Time. All other amounts owed or owing under
the Assigned Contracts shall be apportioned between Parent and the applicable
Buyer as of the Cut-Off Time.

vi.The applicable Buyer shall receive a credit for any accrued but unpaid
sales, use, rooms, occupancy, excise and similar Taxes, personal property
Taxes, ad valorem real estate Taxes, and other Taxes imposed in respect of the
Hotels, the Real Property and the other Hotel Assets for the portion of the
current year which has elapsed prior to the Closing Date (and to the extent
unpaid, for prior years), and Parent shall receive a credit for any such Taxes
imposed in respect of the Hotels, the Real Property and the other Hotel Assets
for the portion of the period after the Closing to the extent such Taxes have
been paid prior to the Closing. If the amount of any such Taxes have not been
determined as of the Closing, such credit shall be based on the most recent
ascertainable Taxes and shall be reprorated upon issuance of the final Tax
bill. Any refunds of such Taxes shall be allocated between the applicable
Buyer and Parent based on the portion of the year in which the Closing
occurred that each of them owned (directly or indirectly) the applicable
Hotel, Real Property or other Hotel Assets. In no event shall Parent or any
Selling Subsidiary be charged with or be responsible for any increase in the
Taxes on the Real Property or other Hotel Assets resulting from the sale of
the Real Property or other Hotel Assets contemplated by this Agreement or from
any improvements made or leases entered into on or after the Closing Date. If
any assessments on the Real Property or other Hotel Assets are payable in
installments, then the installment allocable to the current period shall be
prorated (with the applicable Buyer being allocated the obligation to pay any
installments due after the Closing Date).

vii.Parent may appeal any Taxes imposed in respect of the applicable Hotel,
Real Property or other Hotel Assets for any pre-Closing period, and any
contingency fee charged by any consultant or other third party pursuing such
Tax appeal shall be reduced on a pro-rated basis from the refund payable to
each of Parent and the applicable Buyer. If any appeal of any Taxes is pending
as of the Closing Date with respect to any Tax period that has closed prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to receive any rebate or credit
resulting from such appeal, and shall pay all expenses of prosecuting such
appeal. If any appeal of any Taxes is pending as of the Closing Date with
respect to the period in which the Closing Date occurs ("Current Year Tax
Appeal"), such Taxes shall be re-prorated between Parent and the applicable
Buyer as of the Cut-off Time in accordance with the results of such Current
Year Tax Appeal. Parent and Buyers shall cooperate in the prosecution of each
Current Year Tax Appeal. All third party costs and fees incurred in connection
with any Current Year Tax Appeal, including legal fees and expenses, shall be
paid by Parent to the extent due and payable prior to the Closing Date, and
shall be paid by the applicable Buyer to the extent due and payable on or
after the Closing Date, but upon completion of the Current Year Tax Appeal,
all such costs and fees shall be prorated between the applicable Buyer and
Parent in the same proportion as they bear re-prorated Taxes. 



viii.Utilities and fuel, including, without limitation, steam, water,
electricity, gas and oil shall be prorated as of the Closing. Parent shall
cause the meters, if any, for utilities to be read the day on which the
Closing Date occurs and to pay (or cause the applicable Selling Subsidiary to
pay) the bills rendered on the basis of such readings. If any such meter
reading for any utility is not available, then adjustment therefor shall be
made on the basis of the most recently issued bills therefor which are based
on meter readings no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date,
and such adjustment shall be reprorated when the next utility bills are
received. Parent shall receive a credit for all deposits made by or on behalf
of Parent, any Selling Subsidiary or any Manager as of the Cut-Off Time as
security under any Assigned Contract, utility, public service or other
arrangement to the extent the same remains on deposit for the benefit of the
applicable Buyer.

ix.The applicable Buyer shall receive a credit at the Closing for the value of
the Employee Benefit Payables (except to the extent Parent has made (directly
or indirectly) payment therefor to any Manager prior to Closing and such Buyer
will receive the benefit of such payment after Closing), and shall assume all
liability and responsibility for the Employee Benefit Payables for which such
Buyer receives a credit. Buyers shall bear all liability and be solely
responsible for all Employee related liabilities and obligations attributable
to the period, or otherwise arising, from and after the Cut-off Time. To the
extent Parent has, prior to the Closing, paid (directly or indirectly) for any
Employee related liability or obligation that is attributable to the period,
or otherwise arising, on or after the Cut-off Time, Parent shall receive a
credit at the Closing for such payments. The applicable Buyer shall receive a
credit for benefits, leave or performance bonuses that are earned by Employees
prior to the Cut-off Time, but which have not yet been paid by Parent, the
applicable Selling Subsidiary (or the applicable Manager on either of their
behalves) prior to the Cut-off Time (it being agreed and understood that such
credit shall be based on the applicable Manager's estimate thereof at the
Closing, and shall be reconciled after the Closing pursuant to Section 2.7(b),
giving effect to the actual amounts).

x.To the extent the applicable Selling Subsidiary is entitled to such revenues
under the applicable Management Agreement or otherwise, Parent shall receive a
credit for all vending machine revenues, and pay telephone and washroom and
checkroom revenues at the Hotels as of the Closing and all such revenues
following the Closing shall become the property of the applicable Buyer upon
the Closing.

xi.Parent shall receive a credit for any recurring fees for any Real
Property's or any Hotel's Permits which have been paid by Parent (or the
applicable Manager, Selling Subsidiary) prior to the Closing and relate to the
period from and after the Closing Date, and the applicable Buyer shall receive
a credit for any such fees which have not been paid as of the Closing and
relate to the period prior to the Closing Date.

xii.All fees, reimbursements and other amounts payable to Managers under the
Management Agreements which are included in the Assigned Contracts, if any,
shall be apportioned between Parent and the applicable Buyer as of the Cut-off
Time. Any incentive management or similar fee payable under any such
Management Agreement (each, an "IMF") to the Manager under such Management
Agreement shall be apportioned as follows:

1.Within five (5) days after issuance by the applicable Manager of a financial
or other operating statement under the applicable Management Agreement (the
"Final Accounting Period Statement") for the accounting period in which the
Closing occurs (the "Final Accounting Period"), Parent and the applicable
Buyer shall calculate an adjustment to the IMF, representing the difference
between (x) the aggregate IMF paid to the applicable Manager for the 2014
Fiscal Year prior to the Cut-off Time as shown on the Final Accounting Period
Statement, and (y) the Actual IMF at the Closing as calculated below. If the
Actual IMF at the applicable exceeds the IMF paid to the applicable Manager
prior to the Cut-off Time as shown on the Final Accounting Period Statement,
Parent shall pay the excess thereof to such Buyer within five (5) days of such
determination. If the Actual IMF at the Closing is less than the IMF paid to
the applicable Manager prior to the Cut-off Time as shown on the Final
Accounting Period Statement, such Buyer shall pay 



the shortfall to Parent within five (5) days of such determination. The
"Actual IMF" shall be calculated as the sum of (a) 2014 fiscal year Operating
Profit prior to the Cut-off Time, divided by the applicable Manager's most
recent forecast of full 2014 fiscal year Operating Profit, multiplied by (b)
such Manager's forecast of full 2014 fiscal year IMF. "Operating Profit" shall
have the meaning ascribed to such term in the applicable Management Agreement
(or any term of similar import in the applicable Management Agreement which
serves as the basis for calculating the IMF thereunder), and for purposes of
this paragraph Operating Profit for the Final Accounting Period shall be
prorated based on the number of days in such Final Accounting Period that are
prior to, or after, the Cut-off Time.

2.As part of the Final Settlement Statement, Parent and the applicable Buyer
shall determine, based on the information provided in the Final Accounting
Period Statement, whether the Actual IMF for the 2014 Fiscal Year differs from
the forecasted IMF used in determining the adjustment to the IMF described in
Section 2.7(a)(xii)(B). As part of the True-up Amount, Parent and such Buyer
shall each pay to the other such amounts as may be necessary to correct the
adjustment to the IMF.

xiii.Parent shall retain all account(s) that hold all funds for the benefit of
Parent, any Selling Subsidiary or any Hotel, including any "FFandE reserve,"
"reserve for replacements," "working capital," "operating funds," or other
accounts, reserves or escrows, whether maintained by any Manager under the
applicable Management Agreement or otherwise. At the Closing, the applicable
Buyer shall fully fund any required reserve, escrow or similar fund or account
under the Management Agreements; provided, however, that if as of the Closing
Date, any Manager under an assumed Management Agreement shall not have
deposited into any "FFandE reserve," "reserve for replacements," "working
capital," "operating funds," or other accounts, reserves, escrows or similar
accounts the amounts required under the applicable assumed Management
Agreement to be deposited therein for the Final Accounting Period and such
amounts shall have otherwise been deposited into a reserve at or with respect
to the Real Property and remain available to be used by the applicable owner
or Manager for Real Property expenses as of Closing, then Parent shall receive
a credit for such amount, apportioned as of the Cut-off Time.

xiv.Rent and all other amounts actually received from Occupants under any
Space Leases shall be apportioned between Parent and the applicable Buyer as
of the Cut-Off Time. If any arrearage exists under any Space Lease as of the
Closing Date, any amounts collected on or after the Closing Date with respect
to such Space Lease shall be applied first to amounts then due and payable
under such Space Lease with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, and
thereafter to any amounts then due and payable under such Space Lease with
respect to the period from and after the Closing Date.

xv.The applicable Buyer shall receive a credit for all cash security deposits,
if any, held by or for any Selling Subsidiary under any Space Leases. Such
Buyer shall cause such amount to be maintained after the Closing as a security
deposit in accordance with the terms of the applicable Space Lease and
applicable Law and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified
Parties from all Legal Proceedings of Occupants with respect thereto. In the
event that any Selling Subsidiary holds any letters of credit as a security
deposit under any Space Lease, then Parent shall cause such letters of credit
to be transferred to the applicable Buyer at the Closing or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. Such Buyer shall bear all costs and
expenses required to transfer any such letters of credit.

xvi.All rent payable under the Ground Leases shall be prorated between Parent
and the applicable Buyer as of the Closing Date on an accrual basis, based on
the actual number of days in the month (quarter, year or other applicable
period) during which the Closing Date occurs. Parent shall be responsible for
all rent payable under the Ground Leases attributable to the period before the
Closing Date and the applicable Buyer shall be responsible for all rent
payable under the Ground Leases attributable to the period on and after the
Closing Date. In addition, Parent shall receive a credit at the Closing for
the then-balances, if any, of all impounds and reserves held under the Ground
Leases (and at the Closing, the applicable Buyer shall receive all rights of
Parent thereto).

xvii.Any other items of operating income or operating expense which are
customarily apportioned between the parties in real estate closings of
comparable commercial properties in 



the metropolitan area where the applicable Real Property is located shall be
prorated between Parent and the applicable Buyer as of the Closing Date on an
accrual basis, based on the actual number of days in the month (quarter, year
or other applicable period) during which the Closing Date occurs.

(b)All of the Prorated Items that can be determined or estimated as of the
Closing Date shall be so determined or estimated by the Hospitality Accountant
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing in a report (the
"Estimated Proration Report") which shall be attached to, and form a part of,
the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to Buyers pursuant to Section 2.4.
The Estimated Proration Statement shall include a detailed breakdown of the
Prorated Items and shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
calculation principles and procedures set forth in Section 2.7(a); provided,
however, the Estimated Proration Report shall not include (i) an estimate of
revenues or payables applicable to the night before or day of the Closing,
which shall instead be included as part of the Final Settlement Statement, as
hereinafter defined and (ii) the final cash accounting described in Section
2.7(a)(iii), which shall be finalized and included on the Closing Statement on
the Closing Date. Three (3) months following the Closing Date, Buyers shall
prepare and issue to Parent an updated proration report and closing statement
(the "Final Settlement Statement") prepared in a manner consistent with the
calculation principles and procedures set forth in Section 2.7(a), and which
shall adjust those Prorated Items and other items on the Closing Statement (A)
which were not apportioned on the Estimated Proration Report or Closing
Statement because of the unavailability of information, (B) which were
apportioned on the Estimated Proration Report or Closing Statement based upon
estimated, inaccurate or incomplete information, or (C) for which manifest
errors existed on the Estimated Proration Report or Closing Statement. Buyers
and Parent shall each have the right to have their respective accountants
review drafts of the Final Settlement Statement such that the Final Settlement
Statement accurately reflects the operations of the Hotels on the Closing
Date, and Buyers shall provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access to the Hotels or each Buyer's principal place of business where such
books and records are maintained to review such books and records to enable
Parent to audit the same with respect to the Final Settlement Statement. The
Parties shall meet to come to a final determination of the accuracy of the
Final Settlement Statement within thirty (30) days ("Final Proration Period")
after the issuance of the Final Settlement Statement. Unless any matters
remain in dispute upon the expiration of the Final Proration Period, then
within five (5) days of such expiration, Parent or Buyers, as the case may be,
shall pay to the other the amount as may be required by the Final Settlement
Statement (the "True-up Amount"). If any matters remain in dispute (the
"Unresolved Items") at the expiration of any Final Proration Period, then
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or, if at the time of such dispute
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is performing audit or other services for either
Parent or any Buyer, then such other independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing which is not providing such services to either Parent or any
Buyer at such time and is otherwise mutually selected by Parent and Buyers)
shall resolve such Unresolved Items, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, but in no case shall they review or propose any resolution for any
matters that are not Unresolved Items. If neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
nor any such mutually selected accounting firm is willing and able to serve in
such capacity, then Parent shall within ten (10) days deliver to Buyers a
listing of three other accounting firms of recognized national or regional
standing and Buyers shall within ten (10) days after receipt of such list,
select one of such three accounting firms, provided that the firm ultimately
selected may not be performing audit or other services for either Parent or
any Buyer at such time (such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant to the
aforementioned procedures being the "True-Up Accountant"). Buyers and Parent
shall use their Reasonable Efforts to cause the True-Up Accountant to issue
its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items within thirty (30)
days after such Unresolved Items are submitted for review. The True-Up
Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items
only and shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, that need to be made
in order for the Final Settlement Statement to comply with the standards
referred to in this Section 2.7. In no event shall the True-Up Accountant's
determination of any Unresolved Items be outside the range of Buyers' and
Parent's disagreement. The determination of the True-Up Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Such amounts as
finally determined by the True-Up Accountant shall be used to 



determine the True-Up Amount, which shall be paid by the applicable Party
within five (5) days of the True-Up Accountant's determination. Upon payment
of the True-up Amount pursuant to this Section 2.7(b), such True-Up Amount
shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties and except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement there shall be no further adjustment
between Parent and Buyers for income and expenses.

(c)Buyers and Parent shall share the fees and expenses of the True-Up
Accountant in inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the Unresolved
Items determined in favor of such Party, in accordance with the following
formulas: (i) Parent shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses equal to
the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the dollar amount of Unresolved Items resolved in favor of Buyers and the
denominator of which is the total dollar amount of Unresolved Items and (ii)
Buyers shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses equal to the total fees
and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar
amount of Unresolved Items resolved in favor of Parent and the denominator of
which is the total dollar amount of Unresolved Items.

Section 2.8 Closing Costs. In connection with the Closing, Buyers shall bear
the costs, fees and expenses required to be incurred in connection with, or
arising as a result of, (a) obtaining any Franchisor Consent (including any
franchise license fees or PIPs) or any Manager Consent, (b) any endorsements
to any title policies and any lender's policies with respect to the Real
Property (whether for owner's, leasehold or lender's policies and including,
in each case, extended coverage), (c) any survey costs, environmental report
costs or any other costs related to Buyers' diligence of or access to the Real
Properties, (d) the termination of any Terminating Management Agreement
(including any termination fees thereunder) or (e) Buyer's election to obtain
co-insurance provided by a Co-Insurer on any Title Policy pursuant to Section
2.10(e), which costs are in excess of the cost of the premium on such Title
Policy if the Deposit Escrow Agent had provided such Title Policy without such
co-insurance. Parent shall bear the costs, fees and expenses required to be
incurred in connection with the termination of any TRS Lease. All transfer,
stamp, excise and similar Taxes (except for any such Taxes to be borne by
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.12) and all recording fees and charges incident to
the sale of the Hotel Assets (including any such Taxes determined to be
payable after the Closing in connection with a post-Closing audit by any
Governmental Authority), in addition to any premiums for owner's or leasehold
title policies (other than costs, fees and expenses related to endorsements
thereto, which are addressed in clause (b) of the first sentence of this
Section 2.8), shall be borne equally by the Parties. The costs, fees and
expenses required to be incurred in connection with the engagement of the
Deposit Escrow Agent or the Hospitality Accountant shall be borne equally by
the Parties. All other costs incurred at the Closing shall be borne by the
Parties in accordance with local custom.

Section 2.9 Pre-Closing Access. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall afford to
each Buyer and its authorized Representatives reasonable access (at such
Buyer's sole cost and risk, during normal business hours and in such manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of Parent's, the
Selling Subsidiaries', any Manager's or any Occupant's business at the Hotels)
to such Real Property, Hotels and other Hotel Assets (including the books,
Contracts and records of the Selling Subsidiary that owns or otherwise has the
right to use such Real Property, Hotel or other Hotel Assets) to the extent
the same is in Parent's possession (it being agreed and understood that any
such books, Contracts, records and other information made available in
Parent's electronic dataroom to which any Buyer and its Representatives have
access shall constitute sufficient access hereunder), in each case, as such
Buyer and such Representatives may reasonably request; provided, that each
Buyer shall (a) jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Parent Indemnified Party from and against any and all liabilities, claims and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), including, without
limitation, those for personal injury to or death of any of such Buyer's
directors, officers, employees, or other Representatives, in each case arising
out of or related to any access permitted by this Section 2.9, except to the
extent such claims arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Parent Indemnified Parties or due to pre-existing conditions affecting the
Real Property (but only to the extent that such Buyer's or its
Representatives' access thereto does not disturb, amplify or otherwise affect
such pre-existing condition), (b) provide Parent with a liability insurance
policy naming 



Parent as a named insured in the amount of at least $2,000,000 with respect to
such Buyer's or its Representatives' activities at the Real Property, the
Hotels and the other Hotel Assets and (c) restore the Hotels, the Real
Property and the other Hotel Assets, at its own expense, to substantially the
same condition which existed prior to its access thereto. Parent shall have
the right to have a Representative present at all times during any such
inspections and examinations. Additionally, each Buyer shall hold in
confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in any Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Buyer shall have right of access to, and Parent shall have no
obligation to provide to such Buyer, information relating to (i) bids received
from others in connection with the sale process that gave rise to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in connection with any other
sale process related to the Real Property, any Hotel or any other Hotel
Assets, or any information or analysis (including financial analysis) relating
to any such bids, (ii) any information the disclosure of which would (A)
jeopardize any legal privilege or work-product privilege available to Parent,
any of the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates relating
to such information, (B) cause Parent, any of the Selling Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation or (C)
have an adverse competitive impact on Parent, any of the Selling Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Affiliates as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, (iii) organizational, financial and other documents relating to
Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any Selling Subsidiary), (iv)
information contained in any internal financial analyses or projections with
respect to the Selling Subsidiaries or the Real Property, any Hotel or any
other Hotel Asset or (v) any information the disclosure of which would result
in a violation of Law or Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of
Parent, (x) neither Buyer shall contact any landlords under Ground Leases,
Occupants, Managers, Franchisors, non-managerial Employees or Lenders or any
of their respective Representatives regarding the Real Property, the Hotels,
the other Hotel Assets, this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (y) neither Buyer shall have
any right to perform any physical or invasive testing (environmental,
structural or otherwise) at any Real Property or any Hotel (such as soil
borings, water samplings or the like).



Section 2.10 Third Party Approvals and Notifications; Non-Assignable Assets;
Further Assurances; Co-Insurance; Specified Declaration.

(a)Parent shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, use Reasonable
Efforts to, as soon as reasonably practicable, obtain such consents, waivers,
approvals, orders and authorizations (including the Required Manager Consents
and the Required Franchisor Consents), and make such notifications (including
to Lenders under the Prepaid Existing Loans), in each case, as are reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively the
"Third Party Approvals and Notifications"). Each Buyer shall cooperate with
Parent to assist Parent to obtain such Third Party Approvals and
Notifications.

(b)Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 2.10(a), but
in furtherance thereof, the following provisions shall apply prior to the
Closing:

i.Promptly following the date hereof (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days following the date hereof), each Buyer, at its sole cost and
expense and in its own name, shall make all necessary applications (on each
Franchisor's standard form application) for, and shall diligently pursue, each
of the Franchisor Consents. Each Buyer shall keep Parent informed of the
status of each such application and shall promptly respond to Parent's
inquiries regarding the status of the same. Each Buyer acknowledges that it
has received, in connection with the Franchisor Consents, a Property
Improvement Program ("Existing PIP") prepared by each Franchisor, pursuant to
which Buyer will be required to upgrade and make certain improvements at the
applicable Hotels in connection with its purchase thereof. The applicable
Buyer shall satisfy the requirements of the Existing PIPs pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
Closing, the applicable Buyer may, but shall not be obligated to, endeavor to
negotiate with each Franchisor to amend the requirements of the Existing PIPs.
If the applicable 



Buyer and any Franchisor agree in writing to amend the requirements of any
Existing PIP (such amended Existing PIP being referred to herein as a
"Negotiated PIP"), then such Buyer shall satisfy the requirements of the
Negotiated PIP pursuant to and in accordance with the terms thereof. If the
applicable Buyer and any Franchisor do not agree in writing on a Negotiated
PIP prior to the Closing, then such Buyer shall remain obligated to satisfy
the requirements of the Existing PIP pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms thereof. All upgrades and improvements required by the Existing PIP or
Negotiated PIP, as applicable, shall be performed after the Closing at Buyers'
sole cost and expense, without any debit or credit to the Closing Cash
Consideration.

ii.Buyers hereby agree and acknowledge that no Buyer shall assume, pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, any of the Management Agreements set
forth on Annex C (the "Terminating Management Agreements"), and Buyers hereby
direct Parent to take such actions as are necessary (at Buyers' sole cost and
expense) to terminate the Terminating Management Agreements, effective as of
the Closing. Parent shall cause the Terminating Management Agreements to be
terminated prior to the Closing (at Buyers' sole cost and expense), and Buyers
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection therewith (including, in
the case of the Hotels commonly known as Hyatt Place Boston Medford, Courtyard
Tucson Williams Center and Residence Inn Houston Westchase, by obtaining the
Franchisor Consents in respect thereof, as required by the applicable
Management Agreements in connection with the termination of such Management
Agreements). The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the Terminating
Management Agreements shall be deemed to not constitute Assigned Contracts
hereunder, and no Manager Consent shall be deemed to exist in respect of any
Terminating Management Agreement.

iii.Prior to the Closing, Parent and Buyers shall use Reasonable Efforts to
cause each applicable Manager (other than any Manager under a Terminating
Management Agreement) to deliver a Manager Consent. Promptly upon execution of
this Agreement, the applicable Buyer shall provide to each Manager from whom a
Manager Consent is required appropriate information demonstrating such Buyer's
compliance with any applicable requirements (if any) of the applicable
Management Agreements, the satisfaction of which are necessary for the
assignment thereof to such Buyer, and Parent shall notify each such Manager of
the execution of this Agreement. Upon request of Parent or any such Manager,

such Manager may reasonably request. Parent and Buyers shall each promptly
notify the other of any material communication received from any such Manager
relating to compliance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with

Management Agreement), an estoppel certificate in form and substance
customarily given by such Manager.

iv.Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause

pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be absolute, continuing and
unconditional, notwithstanding (A) any negative or adverse financial or
operating results of any Hotel or Selling Subsidiary (whether taken
individually or taken as a whole) or any failure of any of them to meet with
any financial projections, forecasts, estimates, business plans or otherwise,
whether prepared by any Buyer, Parent, any Manager or any of their respective
Representatives, (B) any action or omission taken or made by any Manager or
Franchisor, which action or omission has or may have any negative or adverse
effect described in the foregoing clause (A) or (C) any matters arising out of

as a result of (x) the Hotel Assets ceasing to be managed or operated by the
employees of Parent that currently manage and operate such Hotel Assets or (y)
Parent ceasing (or taking steps to cease) its operations in the 



hotel or lodging industry generally) or any action taken by Parent in
furtherance thereof. In no event shall any of the provisions of this Agreement
(including this Section 2.10(b)) be interpreted to require Parent to provide
any additional contributions to capital to any of the Selling Subsidiaries or
to otherwise remedy any negative or adverse financial or operating results of
any Hotel or Selling Subsidiary (whether taken individually or taken as a
whole) in order for any Buyer to be required to comply with its obligations
hereunder, including such Buyer's obligations to obtain any Third Party
Approvals and Notifications pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).

(c)Subject to, and not in limitation of, Sections 2.10(a) and 2.10(b) each

use their respective Reasonable Efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including by executing and delivering to each other such other documents,

and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding Section 2.1 or anything else in this Agreement to the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents shall constitute a sale, assignment, transfer or
conveyance or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance of any
Hotel Asset for which any consent, approval, authorization, clearance,
exemption, waiver or similar affirmation by any Person pursuant to any Permit,
Contract, Law, judgment or otherwise has not been obtained. Pending the
obtaining of any such consent, approval, authorization, clearance, exemption,
waiver or similar affirmation, the applicable Buyer and Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, cooperate with each other in
any reasonable and lawful arrangements proposed mutually agreeable to the
Parties that (i) provides to such Buyer the benefits of use of the applicable
Hotel Asset for its term and (ii) provide that such Buyer will bear the
liabilities and obligations of the applicable Hotel Asset for its term to the
extent such liabilities or obligations would be Assumed Liabilities if such
consent, approval, authorization, clearance, exemption, waiver or similar
affirmation had been obtained. Once such consent, approval, authorization,
clearance, exemption, waiver or similar affirmation for the sale, assignment,
transfer and conveyance of an applicable Hotel Asset is obtained, Parent
shall, and shall cause the applicable Selling Subsidiaries to, promptly sell,
assign, transfer and convey such Hotel Asset to such Buyer, and, to the extent
the liabilities or obligations under such Hotel Asset assigned to such Buyer
are Assumed Liabilities, such Buyer shall assume such liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Hotel Asset from and after the date of
assignment to such Buyer pursuant to a special-purpose assignment and
assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the Assignment
and Assumption (which special-purpose agreement the Parties shall prepare,
execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer).

(e)Within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, Buyer may, by written
notice to Parent and the Deposit Escrow Agent, elect to permit one or more
other reputable national title insurance companies (e.g., Fidelity National
Title Insurance Company, Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, Chicago
Title Insurance Company, Lawyer's Title Insurance Company or Old Republic
Title Insurance Company) (each, a "Co-Insurer") to provide co-insurance under
any Title Policy specified in such notice, provided that (i) in all events the
Deposit Escrow Agent shall remain the lead agent and underwriter, (ii) in no
event shall the aggregate co-insurance provided by all Co-Insurers exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the applicable policy amount under any Title Policy, it
being understood that the Deposit Escrow Agent shall at all times be entitled
to insure not less than fifty percent (50%) of the policy amount under each
such Title Policy, (iii) Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs of
such co-insurance provided by a Co-Insurer on any Title Policy in excess of
the cost of the premium on such Title Policy if the Deposit Escrow Agent had
provided such Title Policy without such co-insurance, (iv) neither Parent nor
any of the Selling Subsidiaries shall be required to execute and deliver to or
for the benefit of any Co-Insurer any separate owner\'s title affidavit or
other title undertaking or indemnity or otherwise satisfy any other separate 



requirements of any such Co-Insurer as a condition to such Co-Insurer
providing such co-insurance, it being understood that Parent and the Selling
Subsidiaries shall only be required to execute and deliver the Owner's
Affidavit to the Deposit Escrow Agent and satisfy any other requirements
agreed upon between the Deposit Escrow Agent and Parent as a condition to
issuance of the Title Policies (although all Co-Insurers shall be entitled to
rely on the Owner's Affidavit and any similar instruments delivered to Deposit
Escrow Agent) and (v) the ability or willingness of any Co-Insurer to co-
insure any Title Policy shall not be a condition to Closing.

(f)At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall provide Buyers with evidence of
the waiver by the Declarant of the Declarant's rights under Section 3(l) of
the Specified Declaration (such waiver, the "Specified Waiver"), it being
agreed and understood that the Specified Waiver may be evidenced either by (i)
an affirmative waiver provided by the Declarant or (ii) the Declarant's
failure to provide Parent (or the applicable Selling Subsidiary) with a
Declarant's Notice (as defined in the Specified Declaration) within thirty
(30) days following the Declarant's receipt of Parent's notice to Declarant
offering the Specified Real Property to the Declarant in accordance with
Section 3(l) of the Specified Declaration. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent fails to provide Buyer with
evidence of the Specified Waiver as of the Closing Date, then (A) the Parties
will proceed to the Closing and shall consummate the purchase and sale of all
Hotel Assets, other than the Hotel Assets specifically related to the
operation of the Specified Real Property (the "Withheld Assets"), which shall
not be transferrred to Buyer, (B) the Closing Cash Consideration payable by
Buyer at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.3(b) shall be reduced by the
Allocated Asset Value of the Withheld Assets, (C) Buyers, Parent and the
Selling Subsidiaries shall have no further rights or obligations under this
Agreement relating to any such Withheld Assets and (D) any such Withheld
Assets shall cease to be considered a "Hotel Asset" for any purpose hereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's failure to provide Buyers with evidence
of the Specified Waiver at or prior to Closing shall not be deemed to (x) be a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent
hereunder for any purpose or in any respect, or (y) result in the failure to
satisfy any condition to the obligations of any Party to cause the Closing to
occur pursuant to Article VII. If not delivered prior to the date hereof,
promptly after the date hereof Parent shall cause the applicable Selling
Subsidiary to deliver to the Declarant the notice of the applicable Offer (as
defined in the Specified Declaration) and other related documents required
under Section 3(l) of the Declaration.

Section 2.11 Purchase Price Allocation. The Parties agree that the Initial
Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Hotels and Hotel Assets in the
manner set forth in Annex F (the "Allocated Asset Values") and Buyers and
Parent shall, prior to Closing, adjust the Allocated Asset Values as
reasonably determined by both parties to reflect the adjustments to the
Closing Cash Consideration that are attributable to the Hotels and Hotel
Assets. Buyers and the Selling Subsidiaries shall (a) cooperate in the filing
of any forms (including Form 8594 under Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue
Code) with respect to the Allocated Asset Values, including any amendments to
such forms required pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any adjustment
to the Closing Cash Consideration, and (b) file all federal, state and local
Tax Returns and related tax documents consistent with such Allocated Asset
Values.

Section 2.12 Sales Tax. At or prior to Closing, Buyers shall either provide to
Parent exemption certificates with respect to, or pay, all sales Taxes
(collectively, "Sales Tax") that is payable as a result of the sale to Buyers
of Furnishings, Consumables, Supplies, and Retail Inventories and all other
items for which Sales Tax is or may be payable under applicable Law
(collectively, the "Closing Sales Tax"). In connection with the Closing Sales
Tax, Parent shall prepare or obtain all applicable forms for filing with the
appropriate governmental authorities and/or that the Selling Subsidiaries
determine are necessary or desirable in order to accurately calculate the
Closing Sales Tax, if available (collectively, the "Closing Sales Tax Forms").
Subject to this Section 2.12, Buyers shall be responsible for paying the
Closing Sales Tax and delivering such Closing Sales Tax Forms to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The term "Closing Sales Tax Forms" includes
(a) valid resale or other exemption certificates and seller\'s permits or
licenses for the sale of Retail 



Inventories at the Hotel (each, a "Resale Certificate") from each of the
applicable jurisdictions; and (b) where applicable, such documentation
confirming that the transactions contemplated under this Agreement constitute
an "occasional sale" under applicable Law (with respect to each Hotel, each is
an "Occasional Sale Certificate"). Parent and Buyers each agree to cooperate
reasonably in executing such Resale Certificates and Occasional Sale
Certificates, if necessary under applicable Law.

applicable Selling Subsidiary is thereafter entitled to receive under such
insurance policies (and such obligation of Parent to pursue such recovery

necessary, submitting a claim prior to Closing). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement, Parent

taken as a whole) or any failure of any of them to meet with any financial
projections, forecasts, estimates, business plans or otherwise, whether
prepared by any Buyer, Parent, any Manager or any of their respective
Representatives, (ii) any action or omission taken or made by any Manager or
Franchisor without Parent's or any Selling Subsidiary's express written

of or resulting from the consummation of any of the Spin Transactions
(including as a result of (A) the Hotel Assets ceasing to be managed or
operated by the employees of Parent that currently manage and operate such

after the Closing, will not have any right, title or interest in, to or under

any of its Affiliates (other than by any of the Selling Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing) without reference to or use of the applicable confidential or

States Securities and Exchange Commission or (z) made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the

to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to confidential or
proprietary information related to the Real Properties, the Hotels and the

Party") shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not to, for
a period of three (3) years after the Closing, directly or indirectly, without

developed by the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates without reference to
or use of any such information disclosed by the Disclosing Party or (C) in the
case of either Buyer as the Receiving Party, any information relating to any

shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to
confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party if they
exercise the same degree of care (but no less than a reasonable degree of
care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their own similar
information.

Proceeding (after provision of due prior notice of such Law or Legal
Proceeding to the other Party) or in connection with such Party's enforcement

anniversary of the Closing, the Parties will cooperate and work together with
each other and their respective Affiliates in connection with the preparation

Agreement, except to the extent such Losses first arise after Closing or
otherwise related to any Buyer's failure to employ a sufficient number of
Employees on sufficient terms and conditions to avoid applicability of the
WARN Act to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by
this Section 6.8(a).

(b)Prior to the Closing, no Buyer shall communicate with any Employees except
with Parent's and the applicable Manager's prior consent. Parent shall
cooperate (and, subject to the terms of the Management Agreements, direct the

Hotel Assets to Buyers. None of Parent, or any Selling Subsidiary or any
Manager shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any act or
omission on the part of any Buyer with respect to such Buyer's conduct of
employment interviews or employee screening. In particular, Buyers are advised
that applicable Law may limit the scope and manner of drug screening of
prospective employees. Each Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless

applicable, 



enter into an interim liquor agreement ("Interim Liquor Agreement") that will
permit the applicable Buyer to continue the sale of alcoholic beverages at the
applicable Hotel from and after the Closing Date consistent with the practices
and procedures in effect as of the date hereof, provided that the Interim
Liquor Agreement is, in the judgment of Parent and such Buyer (and, if
applicable, the applicable Manager), each acting reasonably and in good faith,

area in which the applicable Hotel is located. The Interim Liquor Agreement
shall (i) be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (and, if
applicable, the applicable Manager), (ii) provide for the indemnification by
the applicable Buyer of the Parent Indemnified Parties satisfactory to Parent,
including with respect to all Losses related to the sale or consumption of

required to be delivered by such Buyer at the Closing.



ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 Survival.

All representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until six (6) months after the Closing Date. All of
the Specified Covenants shall survive the Closing until fully performed or
fulfilled, unless and to the extent only that non-compliance with any such
Specified Covenant is waived in writing by the Party entitled to such
performance. All other covenants and agreements of the Parties contained
herein shall not survive the Closing, and the Parties shall have no rights or
remedies with respect thereto from and after the Closing. No Party shall have
any liability for indemnification claims made under this Article VIII with
respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein unless a Claim Notice is provided by the non-breaching Party to the
other Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as the case may be. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim that any Party
may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in this Section
8.1 shall govern when any such claim may be brought and shall replace and
supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise be applicable. If a
Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance with this Agreement prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, then the applicable representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall survive as to such claim, until such claim has
been finally resolved.

Section 8.2 Indemnification.

(a)Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the Closing,
Parent shall indemnify each Buyer and its Affiliates, and its and their
respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers and employees ("Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from and against all Losses that Buyer Indemnified
Parties incur to the extent arising from or out of (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Parent in Articles III or IV, (ii) any breach of
any Specified Covenant of Parent in this Agreement or (iii) any Excluded
Liability.

(b)Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, from and after the Closing,
each Buyer shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Parent and its Affiliates,
and its and their respective equity holders, officers, directors, managers and
employees ("Parent Indemnified Parties") from and against all Losses that
Parent Indemnified Parties incur to the extent arising from or out of (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty of any Buyer in Article V, (ii) any
breach of any Specified Covenant of any Buyer in this Agreement or (iii) any
Assumed Liability.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a
duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 



Section 8.3 Indemnification Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a)Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Parent Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to
any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third
Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification
under Section 8.2 shall promptly (i) notify the other Party (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the nature
of the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such
claim (if any) and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Subject to Section 8.1, failure to
timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Party's indemnification hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure shall have
caused the Losses (in whole or in part) for which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the Indemnified
Party given the Indemnifying Party timely notice.

(b)The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after having received any
Claim Notice with respect to whether or not it is exercising its right to
defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be
without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether
such claim is an indemnifiable Loss under this Article VIII), then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (which counsel shall be subject to
the approval of the Indemnified Party, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final
conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 8.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement
agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any
business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or any admission of guilt
or culpability on any of their behalfs. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), and the
Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim where the Third
Party Claim alleges criminal charges against the Indemnified Party.

(c)If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
8.3(b) within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice or
the Indemnifying Party does not otherwise have the right to defend such claim
pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the
Indemnifying Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
(which counsel shall be subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's
consent (which consent shall 



not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

(d)If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including
providing access to documents, records and information. In addition, the
Indemnified Party will make its personnel available at no cost to the
Indemnifying Party for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings, trials
or appeals as may be reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party also shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and
executing powers of attorney to the extent necessary.

(e)Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, a claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought; such
notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the amount of
the claim or a reasonably detailed estimate thereof, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such claim (if any), and the basis of the Indemnified
Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement. Subject to Section
8.1, failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Party's indemnification hereunder except to the extent (and only
to the extent) that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure shall
have caused the Losses (in whole or in part) for which the Indemnifying Party
is obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the
Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party timely notice.

Section 8.4 Limitations on Liability of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein:

(a)a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent
in this Agreement in connection with any single item or group of related items
that results in Losses of less than $50,000 shall be deemed for all purposes
of this Article VIII not to be a breach of such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement;

(b)Parent shall have no liability arising out of or relating to Section
8.2(a)(i) except if the aggregate Losses actually incurred by Buyer
Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed three quarters of a percent (.75%) of
the Initial Purchase Price (and then, subject to Section 8.4(c), only to the
extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount) (the "Deductible"); provided,
however, that (i) in calculating such Losses, solely for purposes of
determining whether the Deductible has been reached (and not for purposes of
determining (x) any Losses in excess of the Deductible or (y) the amount of
any Losses actually payable by Parent pursuant to this Article VIII), any
Material Adverse Effect, materiality qualifier or similar qualifier applicable
to any of Parent's representations or warranties contained in Article IV
(other than the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.6, 4.7
and 4.10), shall be disregarded, and (ii) the Deductible shall not apply to
any single item, or group of related items, that results in Losses (without
regard to the Deductible, and the payment of which shall not be counted
towards the Deductible) that Buyer Indemnified Parties actually incurred to
the extent arising from or out of the breach of any Fundamental Parent
Representation;

(c)in no event shall Parent's aggregate liability arising out of or relating
to Section 8.2(a)(i) exceed three percent (3%) of the Initial Purchase Price
(the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to any single
item, or group of related items, that results in Losses (the payment of which
shall not be counted towards the Cap) that Buyer Indemnified Parties actually
incurred to the extent arising from or out of the breach of any Fundamental
Parent Representation;

(d)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 8.4(b) and 8.4(c), in
no event shall Parent's aggregate liability arising out of or relating to
Section 8.2(a) exceed the Closing Cash Consideration. 



(e)in no event shall Parent be liable under Section 8.2(a) for any Losses
arising from the negligence, strict liability of or violation of any Law by
any Buyer or any of its Affiliates or arising from an action or omission taken
or not taken by Parent at the request of or with the consent of any Buyer;

(f)the amount of any Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by: (i) any insurance
proceeds actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss; (ii) any Tax Benefits actually realized by such Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to such Loss; and (iii) indemnification or reimbursement
payments actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party from third parties
with respect to such Loss, provided that such Buyer Indemnified Party shall
use Reasonable Efforts to obtain recoveries from insurers, including title
insurers, and other third parties in respect of this Section 8.4(f);

(g)if an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim of
indemnification under this Article VIII, no other Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification;

(h)if the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 8.2 and the Indemnifying Party could
have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party, including any
provider of insurance (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying
claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment; and

(i)Parent shall not be liable in respect of any claim for indemnification
under clause (i) of Section 8.2(a) if and to the extent that any Buyer or any
of its Representatives has knowledge as of the date of this Agreement or as of
the Closing Date of the fact, matter, event or circumstance which is the
subject of the claim.

Section 8.5 Waiver of Other Representations.

(a)Each Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, who is familiar with
the ownership and operation of, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced

or any other Hotel Asset furnished to any Buyer or its representatives or made
available to any Buyer and its Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual
data rooms," offering presentations, management presentations or in any other
form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or in respect of any other
matter or thing whatsoever, and (B) no Representative of Parent has any
authority, express or implied, to make any representations, warranties or
agreements not specifically set forth in this Agreement and subject to the
limited remedies provided in this Agreement, (ii) each Buyer specifically
disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon any such other
representations or warranties not contained herein or in any Transaction
Document that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledges and agrees
that Parent has specifically disclaimed and does hereby specifically disclaim
any such other representation or warranty made by any Person, (iii) each Buyer

forth in this Article VIII.

(c)EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.9, PARENT HAS NOT, DOES NOT AND
WILL NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO COMPLIANCE WITH
ANY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, POLLUTION OR LAND USE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS,
ORDERS OR REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE PERTAINING TO THE
HANDLING, GENERATING, TREATING, STORING OR DISPOSING OF ANY HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS. AS OF THE CLOSING, EACH BUYER RELEASES PARENT FROM ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS SUCH BUYER MAY HAVE AGAINST PARENT OF WHATEVER KIND OR NATURE RESULTING
FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE REAL
PROPERTY OR HOTELS, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL CLAIMS SUCH BUYER MAY HAVE AGAINST
PARENT UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND
LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED (CERCLA), OR ANY OTHER LAW PERTAINING TO THE
RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM OR AT ANY REAL
PROPERTY OR ANY HOTEL. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN
THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, EACH BUYER RELEASES PARENT FROM, AND ASSUMES ALL
RISKS WITH RESPECT TO, ALL CLAIMS 



WHICH SUCH BUYER OR ANY PARTY RELATED TO OR AFFILIATED WITH SUCH BUYER HAS OR
MAY HAVE ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY MATTER OR THING RELATED TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PROPERTY INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REFERRED
TO HEREIN, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, NO BUYER SHALL LOOK TO PARENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE
FOREGOING FOR ANY REDRESS OR RELIEF. THIS RELEASE SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE
AND EFFECT ACCORDING TO EACH OF ITS EXPRESSED TERMS AND PROVISIONS, INCLUDING
THOSE RELATING TO UNKNOWN AND UNSUSPECTED CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND CAUSES OF
ACTION.

(d)EACH Buyer and Parent agree that, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (i) the Real Property, Hotels
and other hotel assets shall be sold and THE APPLICABLE buyer shall accept
possession of the APPLICABLE Real Property, Hotels and other hotel assets on
the Closing Date "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "WITH ALL FAULTS," with no right of
set‑off or reduction in the CLOSING CASH CONSIDERATION; and (ii) such sale
shall be without representation or warranty of any kind, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, including any warranty of income potential,
operating expenses, uses, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose,
and parent hereby disclaims and renounces any such representation or warranty.
Except with respect to any Losses arising out of any breach of any express
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or
any Transaction Document which shall be governed exclusively by the provisions
of this Article VIII, each Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives, hereby waives, releases and
forever discharges Parent, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives,
from any and all Losses whether known or unknown, which such Buyer has or may
have in the future, arising out of or in connection with the Real Property
Hotels and other Hotel Assets including without limitation the physical,
environmental, governmental, economic or legal condition of thereof or the
operation thereof (collectively, the "Released Claims"). EACH BUYER, FOR
ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF EACH of its affiliates and its and their
representatives, SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LEGAL REQUIREMENT,
THE INTENT OF WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS:

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Each Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of its Affiliates and its or
their Representatives, acknowledges that it or its attorneys or agents may
hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to, or different from, those
which it now believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of the
Released Claims, but agrees that (x) it has taken such possibility into
account in reaching this Agreement, and (y) the releases given herein shall be
and remain in effect notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such
additional or different Claims or facts, as to which such Buyer expressly
assumes the risk, and (z) notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any
such additional or different Claims or facts, it is nonetheless such Buyer's
intention, for itself and on behalf of each of its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives, to fully, finally and forever settle and release all
disputes and differences, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, as to
the Released Claims. Each Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives, hereby covenants not to file or
commence any Legal Proceedings against any of Parent or any of its Affiliates
or its or their Representatives in connection with any matter released
hereunder.

(e)The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall survive the Closing indefinitely. 



(f)Each Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives, acknowledges that it has carefully reviewed this
Section 8.5 and discussed it with legal counsel and that this Section 8.5 is a

Section 8.6 Purchase Price Adjustment.

The Parties agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this Article VIII as
adjustments to the Closing Cash Consideration for Tax purposes.

Section 8.7 Remedies; Limited Recourse; Limitations on Damages.

(a)The sole and exclusive remedies for breach of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein,
made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement)
or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be those remedies available
at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies
have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this
Agreement, including the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII), and
the Parties hereby agree that neither Party hereto shall have any remedies or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any statements,
communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representation or
warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

(b)The Parties expressly agree and acknowledge that, prior to the Closing, any
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the other Party or Parties
shall result in irreparable and continuing damage to the non-breaching Party
or Parties for which no adequate remedy at law will exist and that, in the
event of any breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party or Parties
shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance, and to such
further and other relief as may be necessary and proper to ensure compliance
by the breaching Party or Parties with this Agreement, and the Parties consent
to the entry of such relief (and will not contest or appeal any such relief),
without necessity of posting bond or other security (any requirements therefor
being expressly waived). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Buyer expressly agrees and acknowledges that, (i) prior to the date
hereof, Parent has caused the Spin Filing to be made, and as a result of, or
in connection with, the consummation of the Spin Transactions, Parent's
employees that currently manage and operate the Hotel Assets will no longer be
employed by Parent and instead will be employed by an entity operating
independently from Parent, (ii) upon consummation of the Spin Transactions,
together with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent will no longer be operating within the hotel or lodging
industry, and Parent is relying on Buyers in order to facilitate Parent's
ceasing to operate in such industries, (iii) in the event that any Buyer were
to breach or violate its obligations to consummate the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement, Parent would be irreparably harmed insofar as it would be
required to operate the Hotel Assets without having the services of any
employees that had been separated from Parent in connection with the Spin
Transactions and (iv) in consideration of the uniqueness of Parent's
circumstances, as described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), Parent
shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance, and to such
further and other relief as may be necessary and proper to ensure compliance
by each Buyer with its obligation to cause the Closing to occur, and each
Buyer consents to the entry of such relief (and will not contest or appeal any
such relief), without necessity of posting bond or other security (any
requirements therefor being expressly waived).

(c)In addition to the Parties' ability to exercise their respective rights to
injunctive relief or the right to compel specific performance of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.7(b), prior to the Closing, in the event that
either Party breaches any of such Party's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements 



hereunder, which breach would give rise to the non-breaching Party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or (e), as applicable
(after giving effect to the cure periods set forth therein), the non-breaching
Party may exercise such right of termination and, in such case, shall be
entitled to the Deposit pursuant to Section 9.2(b) or (c), as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the Closing either
Party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) (in the event that Parent is
the breaching Party) or the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b)
(in the event that any Buyer is the breaching Party) and the non-breaching
Party elects not to (i) obtain injunctive relief or specific performance
pursuant to Section 8.7(b) or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1, but instead proceeds to the Closing, the non-breaching Party
shall thereby expressly waive its right to recover, and forever release the
breaching Party from any Losses arising out of or related to any such breach.

(d)Except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 8.7(d), after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims, Losses or
other matters arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for claims of breach of this
Agreement which were waived prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 8.7(c),
as to which no remedies shall exist) shall be the rights of indemnification
set forth in this Article VIII only (and in the case of indemnification sought
pursuant to Sections 2.7(a)(xv), 2.9 and 6.8, the rights of indemnification
set forth therein) and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or
recourse, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, equitable remedy or
otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest
extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, the
immediately preceding sentence will not operate to interfere with or impede a
Party's right to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief) for a breach or threatened breach of the Specified
Covenants, and the Parties expressly acknowledge that any breach or threatened
breach of any such Specified Covenant by the other Party or Parties shall
result in irreparable and continuing damage to the non-breaching Party or
Parties for which no adequate remedy at law will exist and that, in the event
of any breach of any such covenant, the non-breaching Party or Parties shall
be entitled to injunctive relief, including specific performance, and to such
further and other relief as may be necessary and proper to ensure compliance
by the breaching Party or Parties with this Agreement, and the Parties consent
to the entry of such relief, without necessity of posting bond or other
security (any requirements therefore being expressly waived). The Parties
acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8.7(d) are reasonably
necessary and commensurate with the need to protect the Parties against
irreparable harm and to protect their legitimate business interests.

(e)NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE
FOR, AND THE DEFINITION OF LOSSES SHALL NOT INCLUDE, ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST
PROFITS OR LOST BENEFITS, LOSS OF ENTERPRISE VALUE, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR
MULTIPLES OF EARNINGS OF ANY BUSINESS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO
GOODWILL, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR
OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTY'S SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT EXCEPT, WITH RESPECT TO
THE DEFINITION OF LOSSES, TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY AWARDED TO A
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR ANOTHER THIRD PARTY; PROVIDED THAT THE FOREGOING
LIMITATION SHALL NOT LIMIT Parent'S RIGHT TO RECOVER THE DEPOSIT IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY BUYER'S FAILURE TO CLOSE IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

(f)All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly 



named as Parties hereto. No Person that is not a named party to this
Agreement, including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
Representative of any named party to this Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliate")
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or based on any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party
against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising
under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, this Agreement or its negotiation or
execution, and each Party waives and releases all such liabilities and claims
against any such Non-Party Affiliates.

(g)The provisions of this Section 8.7 were specifically bargained-for between
Parent and Buyers and were taken into account by Parent and Buyers in arriving
at the Initial Purchase Price. Each of Parent and Buyers specifically relied
upon the provisions of this Section 8.7 in agreeing to the Initial Purchase
Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties
set forth in Articles III and IV (in the case of Parent) and Article V (in the
case of Buyers).



ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may
be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

(a)by the mutual consent of Buyers and Parent as evidenced in writing signed
by Buyers and Parent;

(b)by either Buyers or Parent if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of such order, decree, ruling, injunction
or other action;

(c)by either Buyers or Parent if the Closing has not occurred on or before the
nine (9) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date")
or such later date as the Parties may agree upon; provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date;

(d)by Buyers, in the event of any breach by Parent of any of Parent's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein, which
breach would result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), and in each case, the failure of Parent to cure
such breach (if capable of cure) within thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice from Buyers requesting such breach to be cured; provided that the right
to terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be
available to Buyers at any time that any Buyer is in material breach of any of
such Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein; and

(e)by Parent, in the event of any breach by any Buyer of any of suh Buyer's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein, which
breach would result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), and in each case, the failure of such Buyer to
cure such breach (if capable of cure) within thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice from Parent requesting such breach to be cured; provided that the right
to terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) shall not be
available to Parent at any time that Parent is in material breach of any of
Parent's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein. 



Section 9.2 Effect of Termination; Payment of Deposit.

(a)In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement prior to the
Closing pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall, subject to Sections
9.2(b) and 9.2(c) below, forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any Party. The provisions of this Section 9.2, and of
Sections 8.7, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.11 and 10.12 hereof shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreements shall not be
affected by a termination of this Agreement.

(b)In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing by (i)
either Party pursuant to Section 9.1(c) at a time when any Buyer is in breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.1(e), then, within one (1) Business Day of such termination, Buyers
and Parent shall provide joint written instructions to the Deposit Escrow
Agent, instructing the Deposit Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit to Parent,
subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(d). In the event of any such
termination, and so long as Parent elects not to exercise its rights to
injunctive relief or the right to compel specific performance pursuant to
Section 8.7(b), the receipt of the Deposit shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent for any breach or default of any Buyer of this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2(b) are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the
damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
Parent is entitled to the Deposit and has elected not to exercise its right to
injunctive relief or the right to compel specific performance are uncertain
and incapable of accurate calculation and that the delivery of the Deposit is
not a penalty but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances where Parent is
entitled to the Deposit for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not
enter into this Agreement.

(c)In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing
pursuant to Section 9.1(a), 9.1(b), 9.1(c) (other than in the circumstances
set forth in Section 9.2(b)) or 9.1(d), then, within one (1) Business Day of
such termination, Buyers and Parent shall provide joint written instructions
to the Deposit Escrow Agent, instructing the Deposit Escrow Agent to disburse
the Deposit to the applicable Buyer.

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Deposit Escrow
Agreement shall provide that the Deposit or any portion thereof shall not be
released to Parent unless the Deposit Escrow Agent receives any one or
combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parent's independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount of the Deposit that can be paid by
the Deposit Escrow Agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code
("Qualifying Income") and Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the Deposit
Escrow Agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from
Parent's counsel indicating that (A) Parent received a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service holding that the receipt by Parent of the Deposit
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B)
Parent's outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by Parent of the Deposit should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the Deposit Escrow Agent shall release the
remainder of the Deposit to Parent. Buyers agree to amend this Section 9.2(d)
at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of
the Deposit that may be distributed from escrow to Parent hereunder without
causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, (ii) improve Parent's chances of securing a favorable ruling
described in this Section 9.2(d) or (iii) assist Parent in obtaining a
favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 



9.2(d). Any amount of the Deposit that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 9.2(d).

Section 10.2 Successors and Assigns. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Party, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment without the required
consents shall be null and void and without any legal effect. Any such
assignor shall remain jointly and severally liable for its obligations and the
obligations of its permitted assignee. Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to Parent, the applicable Buyer or Buyer Parent
(as applicable) shall also apply to any such assignee. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Buyer
may be permitted to assign the right to receive any Hotel Asset at the Closing
to any of its Affiliates; provided that (a) no such assignment (i) shall delay
or otherwise adversely affect the Closing or (ii) relieve such Buyer of any of
its liabilities or obligations hereunder, which liabilities and obligations
shall remain the joint and several obligations of such Buyer and (b) Parent or
any Selling Subsidiary may, in its sole and absolute discretion, pursue any
Legal Proceeding against, or enforce or demand performance from such Buyer or
any such Affiliate 



of such Buyer, in respect of any Transaction Document, without prejudice to
its rights thereafter to pursue such Legal Proceeding or demand against such
Buyer or such Affiliate, as the case may be.

Section 10.3 Rights of Third Parties. Except for the indemnification
provisions of Sections 2.7(a)(xv), 2.9, 6.8 and 8.2 which are intended to be
enforceable by the Persons respectively referred to therein, nothing expressed
or implied in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third
party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement.

Section 10.4 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein (including pursuant
to Sections 2.7(c) and 2.8 and 2.12), each Party shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby whether or not such transactions shall be consummated.

Section 10.5 Counterparts; Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement may be signed and transmitted by facsimile machine
or electronic mail (via .pdf or similar transmittal), and any signatures so
transmitted shall be treated as an original document.

Section 10.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedule, annexes and exhibits to this Agreement), the Confidentiality
Agreements and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that
may have been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations respecting the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and
the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled
to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the
Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations,
and all Parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no Party has
any special relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length
transaction.

Section 10.7 Disclosure Schedule. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule shall have the respective
meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any item
or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible
breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. The Disclosure Schedule identifies items of disclosure with respect
to a particular section of the Disclosure Schedule by reference to the
corresponding section of this Agreement, provided, however, that each
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Parent,
notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross-reference or a different cross-
reference, in each case to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure.

Section 10.8 Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented
or modified in whole or in part if, but only if, such amendment, supplement or
modification is in writing and is signed by each Buyer and Parent and specific
reference to this Agreement is made in such writing. Any provision of this
Agreement may be waived if, but only if, such waiver is in writing and is
signed by the Party or Parties against whom enforcement of any such waiver is
sought and specific reference to this Agreement is made in such writing. The
waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy 



hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Section 10.9 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

Section 10.10 Mutual Drafting. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, if an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. Further, prior drafts of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents or the fact that any clauses have been added, deleted or
otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document shall not be used as a rule of construction or otherwise constitute
evidence of the intent of the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of such prior drafts.

Section 10.11 Buyer Parent Guarantee. Buyer Parent hereby fully guarantees the
due and prompt performance, payment and discharge when due of, agrees to cause
each Buyer to perform when due, and shall be jointly and severally liable with
each Buyer for the due and punctual performance, payment and discharge of,
each and every obligation of each Buyer arising under this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents (collectively, the "Buyer Guaranteed Obligations"),
including the payment of the Purchase Price and each Buyer's indemnification
obligations under Section 8.2. Whenever this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents requires any Buyer to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Buyer Parent to cause
such Buyer to take such action. The Buyer Guaranteed Obligations are primary,
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and such obligations shall continue
in full force and effect until the payment and performance, as applicable, of
all of the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations and are not conditioned upon any event
or contingency or upon any attempt first to obtain payment from any Buyer
under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, or pursuit of any
other right or remedy against any Buyer through the commencement of Legal
Proceedings or otherwise. With respect to its obligations hereunder, Buyer
Parent expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and
all notices whatsoever. Buyer Parent acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect, without notice
from any other party or any Buyer or Parent in the event the obligations of
any Buyer or Parent under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents
are amended or in any way modified, and that the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations
shall continue and shall apply in full to such amended obligations of such
Buyer or Buyer Parent as though the amended terms had been part of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, as applicable, from the
original date of execution thereof. Buyer Parent waives any right to require
that any resort be had by Parent (a) against any Buyer for any of the Buyer
Guaranteed Obligations or (b) against any other right or remedy available to
Parent by contract, applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer Parent hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies
now or hereafter accorded by applicable Law to sureties and/or guarantors or
any other accommodation parties, under any statutory provision, common law or
any other provision of law, custom or practice, and agrees not to assert or
take advantage of any such rights or remedies. In connection with the Buyer
Guaranteed Obligations, Buyer Parent hereby represents and warrants to Parent
that the value of the consideration received, and to be received, by Buyer
Parent in connection with the transactions 



contemplated under the Agreement is worth at least as much as the liabilities
and obligations of Buyer Parent under this Section 10.11, and that such
liabilities and obligations are expected to benefit Buyer Parent either
directly or indirectly.

Section 10.12 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a)This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, and all disputes
between the Parties arising out of or related to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated herein or the facts and circumstances leading to its
or their execution or performance, whether in contract, tort or otherwise,
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to
conflict of laws principles.

(b)Each of the Parties agrees (i) that this Agreement involves at least
$100,000.00, and (ii) that this Agreement has been entered into by the Parties
hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\. Each of the Parties (A)
irrevocably submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of each state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction
of all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any Legal
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein, (B) agrees that every such Legal Proceeding
shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (provided that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction
is unavailable in or declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims
shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in any other state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware with subject matter
jurisdiction), (C) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court,
(D) agrees not to bring any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein in any other
court, and (E) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any Legal Proceeding so brought.

(c)Each of the Parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other Party with respect to any Legal Proceeding,
including an appeal thereof.

(d)Each of the Parties agrees (i) to the extent that such Party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such Party's agent for
acceptance of legal process and notify the other Party or Parties hereto of
the name and address of such agent, (ii) that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to its address as specified in Section 10.1 hereof with a proof of
mailing receipt validated by the U. S. Postal Service shall be effective
service of process for any Legal Proceeding brought against it, provided,
however, that nothing contained in the foregoing clause shall affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law, and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
that service made pursuant to (i) or (ii) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the State of
Delaware.

(e)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO ITS
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.12(E). 



ARTICLE XI

STATE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

Section 11. 1Retrofit Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyers shall pay and be solely responsible for the cost of
compliance with any mandatory government retrofit standards and inspections
required in connection therewith as a condition of the Closing under any
applicable Laws, including any repairs required for mandatory compliance with
building and safety requirements and energy and utility efficiency
requirements, whether imposed as a condition of the Closing or thereafter.

Section 11. 2Property Disclosures Generally. Each Buyer hereby waives the
right to receive and any obligation of Parent or any Selling Subsidiary to
deliver any disclosures applicable to any of the Hotel Assets and required by
Law; provided, however, if such waiver is not permitted by applicable Law,
then Buyers shall promptly notify Parent in writing thereof prior to the
Closing and Parent shall provide, at Buyers' expense, any such required
disclosures as soon as practicable following Parent's receipt of Buyers'
notice.

Section 11. 3California Matters.

(a)Without in anyway limiting the validity of the waiver set forth in Section
11.2 hereof, Buyers and Parent acknowledge that Parent and/or the applicable
Selling Subsidiaries are required to disclose if any of the Real Property
located within the State of California (each, a "California Real Property")
lies within the following natural hazard areas or zones: (i) a special flood
hazard area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency; (ii) an
area of potential flooding; (iii) a very high fire hazard severity zone; (iv)
a wild land area that may contain substantial forest fire risks and hazards;
(v) an earthquake fault or special studies zone; or (vi) a seismic hazard
zone. Buyers acknowledge that Parent and the Selling Subsidiaries have
employed the services of First American Professional Real Estate Services,
Inc. ("Natural Hazard Consultant") to examine the maps and other information
specifically made available to the public by government agencies with respect
to each California Real Property and to report the results of its examination
to Buyers, Parent and the Selling Subsidiaries in writing. Each Buyer hereby
waives its right to receive any information under applicable Laws with respect
to such matters other than the written report prepared by the Natural Hazard
Consultant regarding the results of its examination that was made available to
such Buyer prior to the date hereof. Each Buyer acknowledges that for the
purposes hereof, the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1103.4
regarding the non-liability of Parent for errors and/or omissions not within
its personal knowledge shall be deemed to apply, and the Natural Hazard
Consultant shall be deemed to be an expert dealing with matters within the
scope of its expertise with respect to the examination and written report
regarding the natural hazards referred to above.

(b)Buyers and Parent further acknowledge that the provisions of Section
25402.10 of the California Public Resources Code require commercial real
estate owners of California Real Property to disclose, in writing, certain
information related to the historic energy use and efficiency of their
buildings to prospective purchasers. Buyers acknowledge that prior to the date
hereof a Data Checklist generated by the Energy Star Portfolio Manager and
relating to each California Real Property was made available to Buyers. Each
Buyer hereby waives its right to receive any information under Section
25402.10 of the California Public Resources Code other than the information in
the immediately preceding sentence that was made available to such Buyer prior
to the date hereof.

Section 11. 4Colorado Matters.

(a)With respect to the Real Property located in Colorado, the surface estate
may be owned separately from the underlying mineral estate, and transfer of
the surface estate does not necessarily include transfer of the mineral
rights. Third parties may hold interests in oil, gas, other minerals,
geothermal energy or water on or under the Real Property located in Colorado,
which interests may give them rights to enter and use the Real Property
located in Colorado.

(b)The Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment and the United 



States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") have detected elevated levels
of naturally occurring radon in structures in the Colorado Springs area. EPA
has raised concerns with respect to adverse effects on human health of long-
term exposure to high levels of radon. Radon tests should be conducted to
determine the possible presence of radon in the Real Property located in
Colorado. Buyer may conduct such other investigations and consult such experts
as Buyer deems appropriate to evaluate radon mitigation measures that can be
employed in the design and construction of improvements on the Real Property
located in Colorado. Buyer shall rely solely upon its own investigations and
consultations and acknowledges that neither Parent nor any Selling Subsidiary
has made any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied,
concerning the presence or absence of radon in the Real Property located in
Colorado, the suitability of the Real Property located in Colorado for
development or the design or construction techniques, if any, that can be
employed to reduce any radon levels in improvements built on the Real Property
located in Colorado. Seller disclaims, and Buyer, for itself, its successors
and assigns, waives any such warranties and other warranties that could be
construed to cover radon.

Section 11. 5Florida Matters.

(a)Without in anyway limiting the validity of the waiver set for in Section
11.2 hereof, pursuant to Section 404.056, Florida Statues, Parent hereby
notifies Buyers as follows with respect to any Real Property located within
the State of Florida:

"RADON GAS: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has
accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks
to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed
federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida.
Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from
your county health department."



(b)With respect to any Real Property located within the State of Florida,
prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries
to (at Buyers' sole cost and expense), use Reasonable Efforts to cause any
existing mortgages (or a portion thereof) encumbering such Real Property to be
assigned to any of Buyers' mortgage lenders (it being agreed and understood
that obtaining such assignment shall not, under any circumstances, constitute
a condition to the obligations of any Party to cause the Closing to occur
pursuant to Article VII).



Section 11. 6Louisiana Matters.

(a)With respect to any Real Property located in the state of Louisiana (the
"Louisiana Real Property), (i) the terms "fee estate" and "fee simple title"
shall mean "full ownership interest" as that term is used in Louisiana law,
(ii) the term "personal property" shall mean "movable property" as that term
is used in Louisiana law, (iii) the term "condemnation" shall include
"expropriation" as that term is used in Louisiana law, (iv) the term
"easement" shall include "servitude" as that term is used in Louisiana law,
(v) the term "county" shall mean "parish" as that term is used in Louisiana
law and (vi) the terms "real property" and "real estate" shall be deemed to
include "immovable property" as that term is used in Louisiana law.

(b)In addition to the items set forth in Section 2.6(b), at the Closing, the

Agreement, including, without limitation, any exhibits, or any related
document (hereinafter referred to as "provision" for purposes of the remainder
of this paragraph), the Parties agree as follows: Notwithstanding any other
term or condition of this Agreement or any agreement, to the extent, if at
all, that any such agreement or provision is found by a court or arbitrator of
competent jurisdiction, to be within the scope of NMSA 1978, § 56-7-2 (2003)
or in any way subject to, or conditioned upon consistency with, the provisions
