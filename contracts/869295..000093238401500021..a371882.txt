AND PLAN OF MERGER    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT"),
dated as of May 13, 2001 is among HS Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company"), Kerr-McGee Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), King
Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("HOLDCO"), Hawk Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Holdco ("ACQUISITION I"), and King Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco ("ACQUISITION II").  
WHEREAS, the parties have agreed pursuant to this Agreement that
(i) Acquisition I will be merged with and into the Company with the Company
as the surviving corporation, as described in Article I of this Agreement
(the "COMPANY MERGER"), and (ii) immediately prior to the Company Merger,
Acquisition II will be merged with and into Parent with Parent as the
surviving corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"PARENT MERGER AGREEMENT") and in accordance with Section 251(g) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("DELAWARE LAW") (the "PARENT MERGER" and,
together with the Company Merger, the "MERGERS").   WHEREAS, concurrently
with the consummation of the Parent Merger, Holdco will be renamed "Kerr-
McGee Corporation" and will become the parent corporation of Parent, as
further described in Article I of this Agreement and in the Parent Merger
Agreement.   WHEREAS, it is intended for federal income tax purposes that
(i) the Parent Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "CODE"), or, taken together with the Company Merger, qualify as an
exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code and (ii) the Parent
Merger and the Company Merger, taken together, qualify as an exchange within
the meaning of Section 351 of the Code.   WHEREAS, the board of directors of
the Company has approved this Agreement and the Company Merger and has
determined that the Company Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of,
the holders of Company Common Stock and resolved to recommend approval of
this Agreement and the Company Merger by the stockholders of the Company.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
contained in this Agreement and for other valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Holdco,
the Company, Acquisition I and Acquisition II intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:     ARTICLE 1  THE MERGERS   1.1 THE MERGERS.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware Law, (a) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(defined below) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Parent Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 251(g) of the Delaware
Law, Acquisition II shall be merged with and into Parent in the Parent Merger
and (b) at the Effective Time, Acquisition I shall be merged with and into
the Company in the Company Merger. Following the Parent Merger, Parent shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as
the surviving corporation of the Parent Merger (the "PARENT
SURVIVING CORPORATION") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and the
separate corporate existence of Acquisition II shall cease. Following the
Company Merger, the Company shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation of the Company
Merger (the "COMPANY SURVIVING CORPORATION") and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdco and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition I shall cease.  
1.2 EFFECT OF THE COMPANY MERGER. The Company Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, when the Company Merger has been
effected, the Company Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of a public as well
as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions, disabilities
and duties of each of the Company and Acquisition I (the "CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS"); and each of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
each of the Constituent Corporations and all property, real, personal and
mixed, and all debts due to either of the Constituent Corporations on
whatever account, as well for stock subscriptions as all other things in
action or belonging to each of such corporations, shall be vested in the
Company Surviving Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, and all and every other interest, shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of the Company Surviving Corporation as they were of
the respective Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real estate
vested by deed or otherwise in any of such Constituent Corporations shall not
revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Company Merger; but all
rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of said
Constituent Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the respective Constituent Corporations
shall thenceforth attach to the Company Surviving Corporation, and may be
enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it.   1.3 CONSUMMATION OF THE
MERGER. As soon as is practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE 6 hereof, the parties hereto will cause the
Company Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of
Delaware a certificate of merger in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Delaware Law (the time of
such filing, or such subsequent time as the Company and Parent agree and is
set forth in the certificate of merger, being referred to herein as the
"EFFECTIVE TIME" and the date of such filing being referred to herein as the
"EFFECTIVE DATE"). The term "PARENT EFFECTIVE TIME" shall mean the time and
date of the filing of a properly executed certificate of   2    merger
relating to the Parent Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (or such subsequent time and date as is set forth in said
certificate of merger). Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated herein shall have been abandoned, and subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 6, the
closing of the Company Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place at a time and
on a date (the "CLOSING DATE") to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the second business day after satisfaction or valid waiver of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 6.   1.4
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (a) COMPANY
SURVIVING CORPORATION. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the
Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the Delaware Law. The
directors of Acquisition I immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
the initial directors of the Company Surviving Corporation and shall
serve until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Company Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the Delaware Law. The officers of Acquisition I immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Company Surviving
Corporation and shall serve until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Company Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware Law.   (b) PARENT SURVIVING
CORPORATION. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent as in
effect immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time shall become the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Parent Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the Delaware Law,
except that the name of the Parent Surviving Corporation shall be changed to
Kerr-McGee Operating Corporation (or such other name as Holdco may
determine) and such other changes as are required or permitted by Section
251(g) of the Delaware Law shall be made. The directors of Parent immediately
prior to the Parent Effective Time will be the initial directors of the
Parent Surviving Corporation and shall serve until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Parent Surviving Corporation\'s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware Law. The officers of
Parent immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time will be the initial
officers of the Parent Surviving Corporation and shall serve until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Parent Surviving
Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware
Law.   1.5 HOLDCO. In accordance with the Parent Merger Agreement and
Section 251(g) of the Delaware Law, the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of Holdco immediately following the Parent Effective Time will contain
provisions identical to those in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Parent immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time, except as otherwise
permitted by Section 251(g) of the Delaware Law and except that at the Parent
Effective Time the name of Holdco shall be changed to "Kerr-McGee
Corporation."   3     1.6 CONVERSION OF ACQUISITION I COMMON STOCK. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger, each share of common
stock of Acquisition I outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company Surviving Corporation ("COMPANY SURVIVING
CORPORATION COMMON STOCK"). Each certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented a number of outstanding shares of common stock of
Acquisition I shall, from and after the Effective Time, be deemed for all
purposes to represent the same number of shares of Company Surviving
Corporation Common Stock.   1.7 CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger:   (a) Subject to the
provisions of SECTIONS 1.7(C), (D) and (E), each share of Company Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
any Dissenting Shares and any shares of Company Common Stock canceled or to
remain outstanding pursuant to SECTION 1.7(E)) shall be converted, at the
election of the holder thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein, into one of the following:   (i) for each such share of Company
Common Stock with respect to  which an election to receive Holdco Common
Stock has been effectively made  and not revoked pursuant to SECTION 1.7(B)
(a "STOCK ELECTION"), the right  to receive 0.9404 shares (the "EXCHANGE
RATIO") of Holdco Common Stock (the  "STOCK Consideration"); and   (ii) for
each such share of Company Common Stock with respect to  which an election to
receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked  pursuant to SECTION
1.7(B) (a "CASH ELECTION"), the right to receive $66.00  per share (the "PER
SHARE AMOUNT") in cash, without interest (the "CASH  CONSIDERATION").   (b)
Each person who, at the Effective Time, is a record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
be canceled or to remain outstanding as set forth in SECTION 1.7(E)
or Dissenting Shares) shall have the right to submit an Election Form
specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that such person
desires to have converted into the right to receive Holdco Common Stock
pursuant to a Stock Election, and the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that such person desires to have converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration pursuant to a Cash Election. Any such record holder
who fails properly to submit an Election Form on or prior to the Election
Deadline in accordance with the procedures set forth in SECTION 1.8(B) shall
be deemed to have made a Cash Election.   (c) In the event the total number
of Cash Elections (including any deemed Cash Elections as provided for in
Section 1.7(b)) would require aggregate Cash Consideration in excess of the
Maximum Cash Consideration (as defined below), such Cash Elections shall be
subject to proration as follows: for each Cash Election made by the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
shall be the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Cash Election multiplied by the Cash Proration Factor. The   4    "CASH
PRORATION FACTOR" means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be
the Maximum Cash Consideration and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
product of the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
all Cash Elections multiplied by the Per Share Amount. All shares of Company
Common Stock subject to Cash Elections, subject to proration required by this
section, if applicable, shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration. The maximum aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration for
purposes of the calculation of the Cash Proration Factor shall be
$833,000,000 (the "MAXIMUM CASH CONSIDERATION"). All shares of Company Common
Stock subject to a Cash Election, other than that number converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this SECTION
1.7(C), shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.   (d) In the event the total number of Stock Elections would
require aggregate Stock Consideration in excess of the Maximum Stock
Consideration, such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows:
for each Stock Election made by the holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Common Stock Election multiplied by
the Common Stock Proration Factor. The "COMMON STOCK PRORATION FACTOR" means
a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock
Consideration and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to all Stock Elections. All shares of Company
Common Stock subject to Stock Elections, subject to proration required by
this section, if applicable, shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration. For purposes of the calculation of the Common Stock
Proration Factor, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock that may receive Stock Consideration shall be 5,412,835 shares (the
"MAXIMUM STOCK CONSIDERATION"). All shares of Company Common Stock subject to
a Stock Election, other than that number converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration in accordance with this SECTION 1.1(D), shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. In the event that
both the proration mechanisms included in SECTION 1.7(C) and 1.7(d) are
applicable, the mechanism in SECTION 1.7(C) shall be applied and the
mechanism in SECTION 1.7(D) shall not be applied.   (e) Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Holdco, or Acquisition I
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and retired
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by a
wholly owned Company Subsidiary or any wholly owned direct or indirect
subsidiary of Holdco (other than Acquisition I) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding.  The consideration provided for in
SECTIONS 1.7(A) and (B), together with the consideration provided for in
SECTION 1.11, is referred to herein as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION."
"DISSENTING SHARES" are shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who neither
shall have voted in favor of the Company Merger nor shall have
consented thereto in writing (other than a holder who has made a Stock
Election for all of such holder\'s shares and where the election is not
subject to proration and is not made pursuant to Section 1.7(d)) and who
shall have demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance   5    with
the Delaware Law. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as if
such holder had made a Cash Election. The Company shall give Parent and
Holdco prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock. Except as required by applicable law or with
the prior written consent of Parent or Holdco, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. At
the Effective Time, each certificate (a "CERTIFICATE") formerly representing
any shares of Company Common Stock, other than Dissenting Shares and the
shares to be canceled or to remain outstanding pursuant to SECTION 1.7(E),
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and the right to receive any distribution or dividends pursuant to SECTION
1.9.   1.8 SURRENDER OF SHARES; STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Holdco shall designate a bank or trust company to act as
agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Company Merger (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") to receive the Merger Consideration
to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to SECTION
1.7. Following the Effective Time, Holdco will deposit with the
Exchange Agent certificates representing Holdco Common Stock and cash
sufficient to make all payments pursuant to SECTIONS 1.7(A) and 1.11 and,
when and as needed, Parent or Holdco will deposit with the Exchange Agent
cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to SECTION 1.8. Such funds
shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Holdco, provided that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500
million.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause to be
mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES"), (i) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment of the Merger Consideration therefor and (ii) an election form (the
"ELECTION FORM") providing for such holders to make the Cash Election and/or
the Stock Election. Any Election other than a deemed Cash Election shall be
validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received by 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on a date (the "ELECTION DEADLINE") to be decided upon by
Holdco (which date shall not be later than the twentieth business day after
the Effective Time), an Election Form properly completed and executed (with
the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed to the extent required by the
Election Form) by such holder accompanied by such holder\'s Certificates, or
by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates from a member of
any registered national securities exchange or of   6    the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company
in the United States as set forth in such Election Form. Any holder of
Company Common Stock who has made an election by submitting an Election Form
to the Exchange Agent may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change
such holder\'s election by submitting a revised Election Form, properly
completed and signed that is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. Any holder of Company Common Stock may at any time
prior to the Election Deadline revoke his election and withdraw his
Certificates deposited with the Exchange Agent by written notice to the
Exchange Agent received by the close of business on the day prior to the
Election Deadline. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
for each share formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate
shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.   (c) At any time following six months after the Effective Time,
Holdco shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been
made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to
look to Holdco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Holdco nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law.   1.9 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock that such holder would be
entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any   7    such holder
pursuant to SECTION 1.11 until such holder shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with SECTION 1.8. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following the surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to SECTION 1.11 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Holdco
Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock.   1.10 NO
FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All shares of Holdco Common
Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 1 (including any cash paid pursuant
to SECTION 1.11) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights represented by such Certificates.   1.11
FRACTIONAL SHARES.   (a) No certificates or scrip or shares of Holdco Common
Stock representing fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a
stockholder of Holdco or a holder of shares of Holdco Common Stock.   (b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Company Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Holdco Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Holdco
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing prices of Parent
Common Stock in the New York Stock Exchange for the five trading days prior
to the Effective Time.   1.12 LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Holdco, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby and any unpaid dividends and distributions
on shares of Holdco Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to
this Agreement.   1.13 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Company Surviving
Corporation and Holdco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules   8    and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Company Surviving Corporation or Holdco, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company
Surviving Corporation or Holdco, as the case may be.   1.14 TAKING OF
NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. Each of Parent, Holdco, the Company and
Acquisition I shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Company Merger
under the Delaware Law as promptly as commercially practicable. If at
any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Company
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either the Company or

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as publicly disclosed
by the Company in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in SECTION 2.4(a))
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement and except as set
forth on the disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect
to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all
other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of
the particular section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry
reasonably to inform Parent of the information required to be disclosed in
respect of the other sections to avoid a breach under the representation
and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other sections) previously
delivered by the Company to Parent (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER"), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Holdco as follows. "To
the knowledge of the Company" and similar phrases mean the actual knowledge
of the individuals described in the Company Disclosure Letter without
independent investigation or inquiry.   2.1 ORGANIZATION.   (a) The
Company and each corporation, partnership, joint venture or other legal
entity of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the
stock or other   9    equity interests the holder of which is generally
entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors or other
governing body of such corporation or other legal entity (the "COMPANY
SUBSIDIARIES") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power
and authority and any necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its property and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or
licensed, as may be required, and in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such
qualification and/or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified and/or licensed would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. A "COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" means any change, effect, fact, event, condition or
development that would have or be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on (i) the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, operations or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
considered as a single enterprise or (ii) the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any change, effect, fact, event or condition
which adversely affects the oil and gas exploration and production industry
generally or which arises out of general economic conditions shall not be
considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 are complete
and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.   (b) SECTION 2.1(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all
of the Company Subsidiaries and their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the
Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances
and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever ("LIENS") and free of
any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell
or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests).
Other than joint ventures, operating agreements and similar arrangements
typical in the Company\'s industry entered into in the ordinary course of
business, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any other person that is
or would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries considered as a single entity. The term "person" as used in this
Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include any corporation, company,
group, partnership or other entity or individual.   2.2 CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
COMPANY.   (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock,
of which 18,034,047 are issued and outstanding and 15,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, of which none are issued and outstanding. In addition, there
are 1,838,801 shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company. Such issued shares of Company Common Stock have been duly  
10    authorized, validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. The Company has not, subsequent to December 31,
2000, declared or paid any dividend, or declared or made any distribution on,
or authorized the creation or issuance of, or issued, or authorized or
effected any split-up or any other recapitalization of, any of its capital
stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired
any of its outstanding capital stock. The Company has not heretofore agreed
to take any such action, and there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company.   (b) SECTION 2.2(B) of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists all outstanding options, warrants or other rights to
subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the Company or any Company Subsidiary
any capital stock of the Company or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock of the Company. The foregoing does not include
the Rights outstanding under the Rights Plan. There are no stock appreciation
rights ("SARS") attached to the options, warrants or rights.   (c) Except
as otherwise described in this SECTION 2.2 or as described in SECTION 2.2(B)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has or is subject to or bound by any outstanding option,
warrant, call, subscription or other right (including any preemptive
or similar right), agreement, arrangement or commitment which (i) obligates
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, sell or transfer,
or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares of the capital stock
or other equity interests of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
(ii) obligates the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to provide
funds to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in any such Company Subsidiary or any other entity, (iii)
restricts the transfer of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, or (iv) relates to the holding, voting or
disposition of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on which the stockholders of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries may vote are issued or outstanding.   2.3 AUTHORITY RELATIVE
TO THIS AGREEMENT.   (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power to
enter into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by the

Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation are inapplicable to Parent, Holdco,
Acquisition I and Acquisition II in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery of this   11    Agreement, the performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the approval of the
Company\'s stockholders as contemplated in SECTION 5.1. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization or
other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by
general equitable principles.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated herein nor compliance by the Company with any of
the provisions hereof will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of the
certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of any
provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination, cancellation of, or accelerate the performance or increase the
fees required by, or result in a right of termination, amendment or
acceleration under, a right to require redemption or repurchase of or
otherwise "put" securities, or the loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,

respective properties or assets, may be bound or (iii) subject to compliance
with the statutes and regulations referred to in SUBSECTION (C) below,
violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation ("ORDER") applicable to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than any
such event described in items (ii) or (iii) which would not (x) prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except for compliance with the provisions of
the Delaware Law, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ("HSR
ACT"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("\'34 ACT"), the Securities Act
of 1933 (the "\'33 ACT"), the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and the "blue sky" laws of various states and foreign laws, no
action by any governmental authority is necessary for the Company\'s
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby except where the failure to obtain or
take such action would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   2.4

Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") all
forms, reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy

Stockholders\' Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (including,
in each case, any related notes and schedules thereto) (collectively, the
"COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") of the Company contained in the Company SEC

in the case of quarterly financial statements, to normal and recurring year-

2001, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued, contingent or
absolute or otherwise (including without limitation under royalty
arrangements), except for those arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   2.5 CERTAIN CHANGES. Since March 31, 2001, the Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice, and there has not been: (A) any Company
Material Adverse Effect or (B) any action taken by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of SECTION
4.1.   2.6 LITIGATION. There is no suit, action or legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceeding or governmental investigation
(the "COMPANY CASES") or Order pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which,
considered individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any court or other governmental entity or

having, or which, considered individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably
likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   2.7 DISCLOSURE IN PROXY

any of the transactions contemplated herein.   2.9 EMPLOYEE PLANS.   (a)
Other than as set forth on Section 2.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

by the Company. An "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN" means any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, practices, agreement or other arrangement providing benefits
to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is

program or policy.   (b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of:
(i) each writing constituting a part of such Employee Benefit Plan (or to the
extent no copy exists, a materially accurate description); (ii) for the three
most recent plan years, Annual Report (Form 5500 Series), if any; (iii) the
current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if
required to be furnished under ERISA; and (iii) the most recent determination
letter from the IRS, if any.   14     (c) Each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service that has not been revoked, and to the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of any such determination
letter.   (d) Except as is not reasonably likely, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions
required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan (or to any person pursuant
to the terms thereof) have been made or the amount of such payment or
contribution obligation has been reflected in the Company SEC Reports filed
with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement.   (e) Except as is not
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in
compliance, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
regulations applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans and each
Employee Benefit Plan has been established and administered in accordance
with its terms.   (f) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of
ERISA (including, without limitation, any multiemployer plan with the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and no liability (other than for premiums to
the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.   (g) The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have no material liability for life, health or medical
benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except
for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.   (h) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in connection with
termination of employment, (i) entitle any current or former employee or
officer of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
other material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer or (iii) give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code.   (i) Except as is not reasonably likely, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims, actions or
suits by or on behalf of any Employee Benefit Plan or by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Employee Benefit Plan, involving any such
Employee Benefit Plan (other than claims in the ordinary course of business)
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such claims, actions or
suits.   (j) The Company does not have any outstanding loans to any
employees of the Company.   15     2.10 BOARD RECOMMENDATION; COMPANY
ACTION; REQUISITE VOTE OF THE COMPANY\'S STOCKHOLDERS.   (a) The board of
directors of the Company has by resolutions duly adopted by the unanimous
vote of its entire board of directors at a meeting of such board duly called
and held on May 13, 2001, determined that the Company Merger is fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, approved and
declared advisable this Agreement, the Company Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and recommended that the stockholders
of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Company Merger. In
connection with such approval, the Company\'s board of directors received
from Lehman an opinion to the effect that the consideration to be paid to the
stockholders of the Company in the Company Merger is fair to the stockholders
of the Company from a financial point of view subject to the assumptions and
qualifications in such opinion. The Company has been authorized by Lehman to
include such opinion in its entirety in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
long as such inclusion is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Lehman and its counsel.   (b) The affirmative vote of stockholders of the
Company required for approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Company
Merger is and will be no greater than a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and no other vote of any holder of the Company\'s
securities is required for the approval and adoption of this Agreement or the
Company Merger.   2.11 TAXES.   (a) The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have timely filed all federal, state, local, and other tax
returns and reports required to be filed on or before the Effective Date by
the Company and each Company Subsidiary under applicable laws and have paid
all required taxes (including any additions to taxes, penalties and interest
related thereto) due and payable on or before the date hereof and all such
tax returns and reports were true, complete and correct, except for such
failures to file or failures to be true and correct as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have withheld and paid over all taxes required to have been withheld and paid
over, and complied with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including the maintenance of required records with respect
thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
independent contractor or other third party, except for such failures to
withhold or pay over and such failures to comply as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There are no encumbrances on any of the assets, rights or properties
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to taxes, other than
liens for taxes not yet due and payable or for taxes that the Company or a
Company Subsidiary is contesting in good faith through appropriate
proceedings.   (b) No audit of the tax returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened. No deficiencies have been asserted against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as a result of examinations by any state, local, federal
or foreign taxing authority and no issue has been raised by any examination
conducted by   16    any state, local, federal or foreign taxing
authority that, by application of the same principles, might result in a
proposed deficiency for any other period not so examined. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any private letter ruling of the
Internal Revenue Service or comparable rulings of other tax authorities that
will be binding on the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
period following the Closing Date.   (c) There are no agreements, waivers of
statutes of limitations, or other arrangements providing for extensions of
time in respect of the assessment or collection of any unpaid taxes against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary have disclosed on their federal income tax returns all positions
taken therein that could, if not so disclosed, give rise to a substantial
understatement penalty within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.  
(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any safe
harbor lease within the meaning of Section 168(f)(8) of the Code, as
in effect prior to amendment by The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act
of 1982. None of the property owned by the Company nor a Company Subsidiary
is "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is required to make
any adjustment under Code Section 481(a) by reason of a change in accounting
method or otherwise except possibly by reason of the Merger. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a member of an affiliated group
of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return (other than a
group the common parent of which was the Company) or has any liability for
the taxes of another person arising pursuant to Treasury Regulation ss.
1.1502-6 or analogous provision of state, local or foreign law, or as a
transferee or successor, or by contract, tax sharing agreement, tax
indemnification agreement, or otherwise. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code with respect
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has been a party to any distribution occurring during the two year
period prior to the date of this Agreement in which the parties to such
distribution treated the distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code
applied, except for distributions occurring among members of the same group
of affiliated corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the production from the wells
referred to in Section 3.16.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter is eligible
for credits under Section 29 of the Code with respect to natural gas produced
and sold from such wells before January 1, 2003, and limited, in the case of
each well, to the formation, if any, identified on Schedule 3.16.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
entitled to claim all credits under Section 29 of the Code arising with
respect to all such production subject to any limitations on the Company\'s
ability to use such credits that may arise under Section 29(b)(6) of the Code
or as a result of the Company\'s recognizing insufficient taxable income in a
taxable year.   (e) The Company has not taken, or agreed to take any action,
and has no knowledge of any condition, that would prevent the Company Merger
and the Parent Merger, taken together, from qualifying as an exchange
described in Section 351 of the Code.   17     2.12 ENVIRONMENTAL.
Except for such matters that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect:   (a) To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no condition existing on any real property

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and no notice, charge, claim,
action or assertion has been received by the Company or any Company

violation that would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All licenses, permits and approvals required under such laws, rules
and regulations are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be

taken all action that may be necessary under the Rights Agreement, so that
the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto and the consummation of

Subsidiaries (including fixed price contracts, collars, swaps, caps, hedges

PARENT,  HOLDCO AND ACQUISITION I   Except as publicly disclosed by the
Parent in the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in SECTION 3.4(A) filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement and except as set forth on the
disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified
therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect to any
particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all other
applicable sections of the disclosure letter if the disclosure in respect of
the particular section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry
reasonably to inform the Company of the information required to be disclosed
in respect of the other sections to avoid a breach under the representation
and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other sections) previously
delivered by the Parent to the Company (the "PARENT DISCLOSURE LETTER"), the
Parent Holdco and Acquisition I hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company as follows. "To the knowledge of the Parent" and
similar phrases mean the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Office and General Counsel of Parent.   3.1
ORGANIZATION.   (a) Each of Parent, Holdco and Acquisition I is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent, Holdco and Acquisition I has
the requisite corporate power and authority and any necessary government
approvals to own, lease and operate its property and to carry on its business
as now being conducted. Each of Parent, Holdco and Acquisition I is duly
qualified and/or licensed, as may be required, and in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such
qualification and/or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified and/or licensed would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. A "PARENT MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" means any change, effect, fact, event, condition or
development that would have or be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on (i) the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, operations or assets of the Parent and the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of the Parent (the "PARENT SUBSIDIARIES") considered as a single
enterprise or (ii) the ability of the Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any change, effect, fact, event or condition which adversely affects
the oil and gas exploration and production industry generally or which arises
out of general economic conditions shall not be considered in determining
whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred. The copies of the
certificate   21    of incorporation of Parent which is incorporated by
reference to, and the bylaws of Parent which are filed as exhibits to, the
Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000
are complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of
this Agreement.   (b) All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each Parent Subsidiary have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by
the Parent, free of all Liens and free of any other restriction (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such
capital stock or other ownership interests). Neither the Parent nor any of
the Parent Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any other person that is or would reasonably be expected to be material
to the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries considered as a single entity.  
3.2 CAPITAL STOCK.   (a) As of April 30, 2001, the authorized capital stock
of the Parent consists of 300,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which
94,966,927 are issued and outstanding and 40,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, of which none are issued and outstanding. There are 6,832,090 shares
of Parent Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. Such issued
shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized, validly issued, are
fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Also, Sun
Pennsylvania Limited Partnership, a wholly owned entity of the Parent, owns
1,107,692 shares of the Parent\'s Common Stock. The Parent has not,
subsequent to December 31, 2000, declared or paid any dividend, or declared
or made any distribution on, or authorized the creation or issuance of, or
issued, or authorized or effected any split-up or any other recapitalization
of, any of its capital stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased
or otherwise acquired any of its outstanding capital stock. The Parent has
not heretofore agreed to take any such action, and there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Parent.   (b) SECTION
3.2(B) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists the aggregate number of
outstanding options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or
acquire from the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary any capital stock of the
Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of
the Parent. There are no SARs attached to the options, warrants or rights.  
(c) Except as otherwise described in this SECTION 3.2(C) or as described in
SECTION 3.2(B) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent, Holdco or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries has or is subject to or bound by any outstanding
option, warrant, call, subscription or other right (including any preemptive
or similar right), agreement, arrangement or commitment which (i) obligates
Parent or Holdco to issue, sell or transfer, or repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire, any shares of the capital stock or other equity
interests of Parent, or Holdco, (ii) restricts the transfer of more than 5%
of the shares of capital stock of Parent or Holdco, or (iii) relates to the
holding, voting or disposition of more than 5% of the shares of capital stock
of Parent or Holdco. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
Parent,   22    Holdco or any of the Parent Subsidiaries having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which the stockholders of Parent, Holdco
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries may vote are issued or outstanding.   (d)
The authorized capital stock of Holdco and the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Holdco as of the Effective Time will be the same as that of Parent
immediately prior to such date, except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement. The shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued in the
Company Merger will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Holdco and when issued in accordance with the terms hereof will
be validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive
rights.   3.3 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PARENT MERGER
AGREEMENT.   (a) Each of Parent, Holdco, Acquisition I and Acquisition II
has the requisite corporate power to enter into this Agreement and to carry

authorized by the respective boards of directors of Parent, Holdco,

Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the performance by Parent, Holdco, Acquisition I and Acquisition
II of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent,
Holdco, Acquisition I and Acquisition II of the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than the execution and delivery to each of Acquisition I and

following execution of this Agreement and the Parent Merger Agreement,
respectively. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent,
Holdco, Acquisition I and Acquisition II and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent, Holdco, Acquisition I and Acquisition II, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.   (b) Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent Holdco, Acquisition I or Acquisition
II, nor the consummation by Parent, Holdco, Acquisition I or Acquisition II

Acquisition I or Acquisition II with any of the provisions hereof will (i)
conflict with or result in any breach of the Certificate or Articles of
Incorporation or bylaws of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or (ii)

Parent Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
(iii) subject to compliance with the statutes and regulations referred to in
SUBSECTION (C) below, violate any Order applicable to Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets other

prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except for compliance with the
provisions of the Delaware Law, the HSR Act, the \'33 Act, the \'34 Act and
the "blue sky" laws of various states, no action by any governmental
authority is necessary for Parent\'s or Holdco\'s execution and delivery of

or  arrangement to do any of the foregoing.   4.2 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF

the Holdco Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Company Merger (the

Company and Holdco shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Holdco
shall assume and honor, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume
and honor, all Employee Benefit Plans including all employment agreements
with executive officers of the Company in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the consummation of the Company Merger, subject to
any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed as prohibiting
Parent, Holdco or the Company Surviving Corporation from terminating the
employment of any Affected Employee. It is acknowledged and agreed that the
consummation of the Company Merger will constitute a "change of control" for
purposes of those Employee Benefit Plans including all employment agreements
containing "change of control" provisions.   (b) For 12 months following the
Effective Time, the Company Surviving Corporation shall continue to provide
to those individuals who are employed by the Company as of the Effective Time
and who remain employed following the Effective Time by the Company Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Company Surviving Corporation ("AFFECTED
EMPLOYEES"), compensation and employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are
no less favorable than the compensation and benefits provided by the Company
to such employees immediately prior to consummation of the Company Merger;
provided, however, that (i) as of January 1, 2002, Affected Employees shall
become eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements of Parent, Holdco, the Company Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company Surviving Corporation
(the "PARENT PLANS") on the same basis as similarly situated employees of the
Parent, and (ii) the Parent Plans shall be deemed to satisfy this SECTION
6.3(B).   (c) The Company Surviving Corporation shall give Affected
Employees full credit for their continuous service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including deemed service credited by such entities) for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan) under all employee benefit plans,
programs, policies or arrangements which are maintained by Parent, Holdco,
the Company Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company
Surviving Corporation for such Affected Employees to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under
similar Employee Benefit Plans.   32     (d) Parent, Holdco, and the
Company Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees under the
Employee Benefit Plans and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (in the calendar year of the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements for the year in which the Effective Time occurs under any
welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after
the Effective Time.   (e) On the basis set forth in, and as contemplated
by, Section 5.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the executive officers
of the Company shall be deemed to have "Good Reason" to terminate their
employment, and receive payments under the agreements between the executive
officers and the Company dated March 12, 2001.   (f) The Company Surviving
Corporation shall sponsor the Company\'s 401(k) Plan as of the Effective
Time. The Company Surviving Corporation either shall continue to sponsor such
401(k) Plan or shall merge such Plan into the 401(k) Plan of the Parent
Surviving Corporation with the result that the participants in the Company\'s
401(k) Plan shall be entitled to repay any outstanding participant loans
pursuant to the terms of the Company\'s 401(k) Plan and to avoid any deemed
distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company may amend its 401(k) plan to permit the Company to match employee
contributions made through the Effective Time in cash, stock, or a mix
thereof in a percentage consistent with past practice.   (g) 2001 bonuses
payable pursuant to the Company\'s key employee severance agreements shall be
calculated on a basis of payment no less than the bonuses paid in 2001 with
respect to 2000.   5.4 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.   (a) The Company, Parent
and Holdco shall each file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice any notifications
required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
The parties shall consult with each other as to the appropriate time
of filing such notifications and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
make such filings at the agreed upon time, to respond promptly to any
requests for additional information made by either of such agencies, and to
cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date after the date of filing.   (b) The Company, Parent
and Holdco shall cooperate with each other and (i) promptly prepare and file
all necessary documentation, (ii) effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions and filings and execute all agreements and documents, (iii) use all
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all governmental bodies and (iv) use all reasonable efforts
to obtain all necessary permits, consents,   33    approvals and
authorizations of all other parties, in the case of each of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required by the terms of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
concession, contract, lease or other instrument to which the Company, Holdco,
Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) no note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, concession,
contract, lease or other instrument shall be amended or modified to increase
materially the amount payable thereunder or to be otherwise materially more
burdensome to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise in order to obtain any permit, consent, approval or authorization
without first obtaining the written approval of Parent and (y) without the
prior consent of Parent, no such actions or things shall be done to the
extent they would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Holdco Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to the
Mergers). A "HOLDCO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT") means any change, effect, fact,
event, condition or development that would have or be reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, operations or assets of Holdco and the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of Holdco considered as a single enterprise following the
Mergers. The Company shall have the right to review and approve in advance
all characterizations of the information relating to the Company;
Parent shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to Parent or Holdco; and each
of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and approve in
advance all characterizations of the information relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case which appear in any filing
(including, without limitation, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) made in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, Parent and
Holdco agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental bodies.   5.5 PUBLIC
STATEMENTS. The Company, Parent and Holdco shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall
not issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or trading market.   5.6 REASONABLE BEST
EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the
Company, Parent, Holdco and Acquisition I agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to obtaining all
consents, approvals and authorizations required for or in connection with the
consummation by the parties hereto of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and contesting and resisting of any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and seeking to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative  
34    action and acceptance by the Company, Holdco and Parent of any and
all divestitures of any assets of the Company, Holdco or Parent or their
respective affiliates or acceptance of an agreement to hold any assets of the
Company, Holdco or Parent separate or to withdraw from doing business in any
geographic area in connection with any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,
except to the extent any such actions or things would be reasonably expected
to have a Holdco Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to the
Mergers). In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Parent
and/or the Company Surviving Corporation shall cause the proper officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Holdco to take all such action. In the
event any litigation is commenced by any person involving the Company, Parent
or Holdco and relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any other Takeover Proposal (as defined in SECTION 5.9), the
Company, Parent or Holdco shall have the right, at its own expense, to
participate therein.   5.7 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of the
Company, Parent and Holdco agrees to give prompt notice to each other of, and
to use their respective reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly
remedy, (i) the occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or
threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or
failure to occur would be likely to cause any of its representations or
warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof through the Effective Time and (ii)
any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this SECTION
5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.   5.8 ACCESS TO INFORMATION;
CONFIDENTIALITY.   (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, to, afford the officers, employees and agents
of Parent and Holdco complete access at all reasonable times from the date

properties, facilities, books, records, contracts and other assets and shall
furnish Parent and Holdco all financial, operating and other data and
information as Parent and Holdco through their officers, employees or agents,
may reasonably request. Parent and Holdco shall have the right to make such
due diligence investigations as Parent and Holdco shall deem necessary or
reasonable. No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect the
Company\'s representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent pursuant to this
Agreement.   (b) Parent and Holdco shall, and Parent shall cause officers of
Parent to, afford the officers and directors of the Company complete access
at all reasonable times from the date hereof through the Effective Date to
its and its subsidiaries\' officers, properties, facilities, books, records
and contracts and shall furnish the Company all financial, operating and
other data and information as the Company through its officers, employees or
agents, may reasonably request. The Company shall have the right to make such
reasonable due diligence investigations as the Company shall deem necessary.
No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect  
35    Parent\'s or Holdco\'s representations and warranties contained
herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement.   (c) The provisions of the confidentiality
agreements between Parent and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS")
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms.   5.9 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company agrees that it shall not,
nor shall it permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate,
or encourage any inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any Takeover
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) approve or recommend any Takeover
Proposal, accept any Takeover Proposal or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (or
resolve to or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) nothing contained in subclauses (ii) or
(iii) above shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from
disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position with respect to a tender
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the \'34 Act, provided that the board of directors of the Company shall not
recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their Company Common
Stock in connection with any such tender or exchange offer unless the board
of directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that the relevant Takeover Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and (y) prior to the Shareholders\' Meeting, if the
Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal from a
third party that the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after receiving the advice of a financial adviser of nationally
recognized reputation) is reasonably likely to be a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), the Company and its representatives may conduct such
discussions or provide such information as the board of directors of the
Company shall determine, but only if, prior to such provision of information
or conduct of such discussions (A) such third party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement not materially less favorable to the Company than
the Confidentiality Agreement (and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this
SECTION 5.9) and (B) the board of directors of the Company determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties. The Company
shall promptly notify the Parent in the event it receives any Takeover
Proposal, including the identity of the party submitting such proposal.  
(b) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify the Parent of the material terms, conditions and
other aspects of any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or which
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal.   36    
(c) If, prior to Shareholders\' Meeting, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of a
financial adviser of nationally recognized reputation and its outside
counsel) that an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(F); provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement, and any purported termination shall be void and of no force or
effect, unless (i) the Company concurrently with such termination pays to
Parent the fee payable pursuant to SECTION 7.3 and enters into a definitive
agreement providing for the Superior Proposal; and (ii) the Company shall
have complied with this SECTION 5.9   (d) For purposes of this Agreement,
"TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing
and whether or not delivered to the stockholders of the Company generally)
for a merger or other business combination, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or to acquire in any manner
(including by tender or exchange offer), directly or indirectly, a 10% or
more equity interest in, any voting securities of, or assets (including
equity interests in other entities) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries having an aggregate value equal to 10% or more of the Company\'s
consolidated asset value, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal which (i) contemplates (A) a
merger or other business combination, reorganization, share exchange,

stockholders prior to such transaction in the aggregate cease to own at least
50% of the voting securities of the ultimate parent entity resulting from
such transaction or (B) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition (including, without limitation, a contribution to a joint
venture) of at least 50% of the value of the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) is on terms which the board
of directors of the Company determines (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel), taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal
and the person making the proposal, (A) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to its stockholders from a financial point
of view (in their capacities as such) than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the terms of any proposal by the Parent to modify
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (B) is
reasonably likely to be financed and otherwise completed without undue
delay.   (e) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its
officers, employees, directors, agents and representatives to, immediately
cease any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of
this Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such
parties (and its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information regarding the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such
information. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
its officers, directors and key employees and its investment bankers,
attorneys and other representatives, are aware the provisions of this
Section.   37     5.10 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.   (a) The Bylaws
of the Company Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with
respect to indemnification set forth in Article VI of the Third Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who at the date of this Agreement were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is
required by law.   (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law or under the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws or under the Indemnification Agreements set forth in SECTION 2.10 of
the Company Disclosure Letter and regardless of whether the Company Merger
becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the

fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring prior to the
Effective Time arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for a period of four years after the date hereof. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Company or the Company
Surviving Corporation, as the case by be, shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the Company Surviving
Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received provided that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides a customary undertaking
complying with applicable law to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification, (ii) the
Company and the Company Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense
of any such matter, and (iii) any determination required to be made in
connection with a claim for indemnification, with respect to whether an
Indemnified party\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth under
Delaware Law and the Company\'s or the Company Surviving Corporation\'s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, shall be made by independent counsel
mutually acceptable to the Company Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor the Company Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and PROVIDED
FURTHER, that neither the Company nor the Company Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated pursuant to this SECTION 5.10 to pay the fees and disbursements
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single action
except to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, two or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such action; and PROVIDED FURTHER that, in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made
within such four-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of any and all such
claims.   38     (c) For six years after the Effective Time, the Company
Surviving Corporation shall provide directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such Indemnified Party covered as of the date hereof or
hereafter by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in
no event shall the Company Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; and, PROVIDED, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.   (d) In the event the
Company Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Company Surviving Corporation, or at
Parent\'s or Holdco\'s option, Parent or Holdco, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this SECTION 5.10.   (e) This SECTION 5.10 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and the consummation of the Company Merger at
the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation. Parent and Holdco shall
cause the Company to honor its obligations pursuant to this SECTION 6.10.  
5.11 ACTIONS REGARDING THE RIGHTS. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall redeem the Rights. Except as specifically provided
herein, the Company shall not modify or waive the terms of its Rights
Agreement or take any action to redeem the Rights.   5.12 OPTIONS. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary (including
obtaining any necessary consents of the holders of outstanding options) to
provide that at the Effective Time (i) each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY OPTIONS"), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and (ii) in consideration of such
cancellation the Company shall pay to holders of such Company Options an
amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per share of such Company
Options and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Options (such payment to be net of the applicable withholding
taxes).   5.13 AFFILIATES. Not less than 30 days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons
who, in the opinion of the Company, may be deemed at the time this Agreement
