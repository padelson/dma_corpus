or to EXCO's Knowledge, threatened in writing, by or before any Governmental
Body or arbitrator with respect to EXCO or its Affiliates (in each case)

7.4 of the UPCA and (iv) for actions or inactions previously approved in

operated those BG Assets currently operated by it in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and (y) not taken any action or failed to take
any action that, if taken after November 5, 2012, would have required the
consent

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of Investor under Section 7.4(ii), Section 7.4(iii)(C), Section 7.4(x) or

ownership, use or operation of the Assets (as defined in the BG PSA) during
the period prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the BG PSA), of which
EXCO (or its Affiliates) had knowledge (within the meaning of such term under

terms of this Section 1.3 (including provisions requiring the timely delivery

Agreement), to indemnify the Partnership Group under Section 1.3(b). For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the provisions of the MLP LLC Assignment,

of this Letter Agreement nor Section 12.2(b)(ii) or Section 12.2(b)(iv) of the
UPCA or in connection with the breach of any such Sections (other than a
failure to comply with the final resolution of a claim pursuant to such
Sections as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment or a settlement
agreement) (i) with respect to any individual claim (or series of related

Effect qualifiers in such representations or warranties shall be disregarded.

  

  

(d) Insurance. The amount of any Damages for which an indemnified Person is

insurance proceeds realized by the indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the indemnified
Person or its Affiliates), and each indemnified Person shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to claim such insurance coverage with respect to such
Damages.

  

  

(e) No Duplication. In no event shall any indemnified Person be entitled to
duplicate compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost,
expense, claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Letter
Agreement. No indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 1.3(b) to the extent that such indemnified Person has been
compensated with respect to the applicable Damages by an adjustment pursuant
to Section 3.3 of the BG PSA.
