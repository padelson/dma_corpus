above together, the " _Board Actions_ ");

WHEREAS, concurrently with, and as an inducement to the willingness of

Persons, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; and

WHEREAS, the Company, HoldCo, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

agree as follows:

ARTICLE I __

Section 1.1 _The_ _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective

third Business Day  following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement or at such other time and date as the parties
mutually agree in writing (the day on which the Closing actually takes place
being, the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
have the right to extend the Closing, upon written notice delivered by Parent
to the Company (the " _Extension Notice_ ") no later than the first Business
Day following the date on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied only at the Closing) are satisfied or waived (the
" _Satisfaction Date_ "), until up to five Business Days following such date
that would have been the Closing Date but for the Extension Notice; _provided_
, _further_ , that if Parent delivers the Extension Notice and the Company
delivers the certificate required pursuant to Section 7.2(d) dated as of the
Satisfaction Date on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be deemed
to have satisfied all of the conditions to Closing in Article VII as of
the Satisfaction Date and shall not be required to satisfy such conditions
again as of the Closing Date, and Parent shall be deemed to have waived the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b).

Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form

the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and
Parent in writing, being the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other

2 ARTICLE III __

 

 __ __ _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_ _;_ __

 

 __ _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each issued and outstanding share of (i)
the Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Class A Common Stock_ ") and (ii) the Class B common stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Class B Common Stock_ ") (with respect to
both (i) and (ii) excluding any Shares granted in the form of restricted
Shares, which shall be treated pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ ), (the Class A
Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock each a " _Share_ "
and, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than (A) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate (as
used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall have the
meanings provided in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange
Act_ ")) of Parent that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the ultimate
parent of Parent, (B) Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (each of such Shares described in
clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") and (C) any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $315.00 (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_"). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than
the Excluded Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be outstanding,
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and thereafter any
Shares represented by a certificate representing such Shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated
Shares, the applicable number of uncertificated Shares represented by book-
entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in each case, other than the Excluded
Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of
which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other Persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding and automatically be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor, subject to any rights
the holder thereof may have under  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger
Sub, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, par value $0.0001 per share.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent (which shall be a
reputable bank or trust company) selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make payments under _Section 3.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the
highest investment category granted by a recognized

 



3  credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be promptly
returned to Parent.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (or, in the
case of "street-holders," deliver to the Depository Trust Company) immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably
acceptable to the parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_
) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section
3.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) of Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
solely be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 3.2(f)_ ) equal to (x) the number of
Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in _Section 3.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire
(pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal) for any
cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to
such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall have the
meaning provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in customary form (or such evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each such Share and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(at Parents election). Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(f)_ ) upon due surrender of its

 



4  Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided
in _Section 3.2(e)_ below) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to and in
compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check or wire (pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of
transmittal) in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably
determines in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or to such Book-Entry Shares.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Each option to purchase Shares under the Stock
Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and
exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective
Time. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding
and unexercised shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company
Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_. In
the event that the exercise price per Share under any Company Option is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefore and
shall have no further force or effect.

(b) _Treatment of SARs_. Each stock appreciation right with respect to Shares
under the Stock Plans (each, a " _Company SAR_ ") that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully
vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon,
the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each Company SAR that is then
outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (y) the base price per Share covered by such Company SAR,
which amount shall be 

 



5  paid in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_. In the event that the base price
per Share under any Company SAR is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration, such Company SAR shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time without payment therefore and shall have no further force or effect.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. Each Share that is then subject to a
risk of forfeiture granted pursuant to the Stock Plans (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested effective immediately
prior to, and contingent upon the Effective Time. In lieu of any issuance of
Shares in settlement of such vested Company Restricted Share, as of the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share that is then outstanding shall
be treated as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ and paid in accordance with
_Section 3.3(e)_.

 

(d) _Treatment of Performance Awards_. Each performance award that is granted
pursuant to the Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Performance Award_ ") that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which the
applicable performance period has not ended, shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount based on the greater of target
achievement and the actual level of achievement of such applicable performance
metric(s) through the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the
compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company in a manner
that is consistent with past practice (the " _Performance Award Amount_ ") to
be paid as follows: (i) a pro-rata payment equal to the Performance Award
Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full
months that have elapsed since the beginning of the applicable performance
period through the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is the total
number of months in such performance period, paid in accordance with _Section
3.3(e)_ , and (ii) the remaining portion of the Performance Award Amount, net
of any applicable withholding Taxes, paid on the earlier of (A) the date on
which such Company Performance Award was originally scheduled to vest,
subject to the holders continued employment with the Company or any of its
Affiliates through such date, and (B) the holders termination of employment
without " _Cause_ " or resignation for " _Good Reason_ " (each as defined in
Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (each such type of
termination, a " _Qualifying Termination_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that a holders employment with the Company (including any
Affiliate thereof) terminates following the Closing Date for reasons other
than a Qualifying Termination, such holders right to receive the payment
specified in clause (ii) above shall terminate;  _provided_ , that, with
respect to any Company Performance Awards payable pursuant to Section
3.3(d)(ii) that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, payment will not be made until the earliest
time permitted that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.

(e) _Payment_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but no later than the first payroll date occurring at least ten Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts
provided for in _Sections 3.3(a)_  _3.3(d)_ , net of any applicable
withholding Taxes as set forth in _Section 3.2(f)_, payable with respect to
Company Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares and Company
Performance Awards (to the extent payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_
(i)) through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll
to the holders of Company Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares and
Company Performance Awards; _provided_ , that, with respect to any Company
Performance Awards payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ (i) that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and
that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at
the earliest time permitted under the applicable Stock Plan and award
agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Sections
3.3(a)_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.3(c)_ , _3.3(d)_ and  _3.3(e)_. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares,
Company Performance Awards or otherwise.

 



6 Section 3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
provide to Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this _Article III_ of this Agreement prior to such change;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 3.5 _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger
and who shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ , but shall become the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such
demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Shares.

qualified by the information set forth in any other section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule other than Section 4.6(a) thereof, other than

aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in

financial condition, business or results of operations of the Company and its

arising out of the following, in and of itself or themselves, shall constitute
or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (A) Effects
resulting from changes in the economy, political conditions or financial
credit or securities markets generally in the United States or other countries
in which the Company conducts material operations or sources material
supplies or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism; (B) Effects

doubt, (i) any loss of revenue or earnings or (ii) the impact thereof on the

action within five Business Days; (H) the existence, occurrence, or
continuation of any earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, fires or
other natural disasters or any national, international or regional calamity;
and (I) any matter disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, where the
applicability of such disclosure as an exception to a particular provision of
this Agreement is reasonably apparent; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
exception in clause (D) shall not prevent or otherwise affect any Effect
underlying such failure from being taken into account in determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C)(ii) and
(H), Effects resulting from any change, event, circumstance or development
that have had or would reasonably be expected to have a material
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries compared
to other companies operating in the United States in the industry in

 



8  which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is
reasonably likely to occur.

Agreement.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). No
Subsidiary of the Company is required to file, or files, any form, report or
other document with the SEC. Each of the Company Reports, as of the respective

employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification or
licensing, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified, licensed or

24  authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to prohibit, prevent, materially impair or materially delay the commencement
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the

authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or to

Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger

be received and to become payable; (b) the assets of such Person as a "fair
valuation" exceeds its "debts" (including contingent liabilities); (c) to the
extent that such Person is the Surviving Corporation, the excess of the "fair
value" of the assets of such Person over its "liabilities" (including
contingent and other liabilities) exceeds such Persons capital; (d) such
Person will not have an unreasonably small amount of assets or capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or intends to engage; and
(e) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, taking into account the
timing and amounts of cash to be received and to become payable. For purposes
of this definition, (x) the quoted terms shall be defined as generally
determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determination of the
insolvency of debtors and (y) "not have an unreasonably small amount of assets
or capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
intends to engage" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they become absolute and mature" means that such Person
will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations (including
contingent and other liabilities) as they become due in the ordinary course.

Section 6.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as

Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, nor shall it authorize or permit

Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or furnish any information or data
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than to notify a
Person of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_), or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, or

constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(iii) approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar

or

 

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may
(A) provide information (which may include non-public information) in response
to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not
more favorable to such other Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and which shall not prohibit the Company from
complying with the terms of this

 



31   _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, and prior to or concurrently delivers to Parent any
such information to the extent not previously provided to Parent and (B)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, prior to taking any action described in clauses (A) and (B)
above, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that (x) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(y) based on the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal, indication of interest or
offer relating to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a merger,
joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender
offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction or series of related transactions
involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries (as such term is
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and (ii) any
acquisition by any Person of, or proposal or offer, which if consummated would
result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly,
in one or a series of related transactions, 15% or more of the total
voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of
any of its Subsidiaries, or the acquisition, purchase or disposition of the
business or 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including equity
securities of its Subsidiaries), revenues, net income or earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

" _Intervening Event_ " shall mean an event, development or change in
circumstances material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
becoming known to the Companys board of directors after the date of this
Agreement that relates to the Company (but does not relate to any Acquisition
Proposal), which event, development or change in circumstance, or
any consequences thereof, becomes known to the Companys board of directors
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any change in, or event or
condition generally affecting, the industry in which the Company operates
that has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a
disproportionate effect on the Company constitute an Intervening Event.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that would result in any Person (or its stockholders) becoming the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 80% of the assets (on a
consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or more than 80% of
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into
account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, the availability of financing, and any conditions to
consummation relating to financing, regulatory approvals or other conditions
beyond the control of the party having the right to invoke the condition), and
other aspect of the Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of the
Company deems relevant (i) is more favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent
pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ ) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be
consummated.

 

" _Representatives_ " means, with respect to any Person, such Persons
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants and other advisors or representatives.

 



32 (c) _No Change of Recommendation; No Other Agreements_. Neither the board of
directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof shall:

(i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (B) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) publicly approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal or (D) publicly propose
to do any of the foregoing (any action or omission described in this clause
_(_ _i_ _)_ being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 

(ii) authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit (or publicly
propose to authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit) the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement or
a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with and subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ ) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the Requisite Company Vote, the board of directors of the Company may make a
Change of Recommendation (and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ ) if and only if (A) the
board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (B) the Company complies with the provisions of this
_Section 6.3(c)_ , it being understood that the board of directors of the
Company may make a Change of Recommendation only in response to (1) any
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) an
Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such action may be made
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(c)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ until after the fourth
Business Day following Parents receipt of notice from the Company (as may be
extended or renewed pursuant to this paragraph, the " _Notice Period_ ")
advising that management of the Company currently intends to recommend to its
board of directors that it take such action and the basis therefor, including
(i) in the case of any Acquisition Proposal all necessary information under
_Section 6.3(f)_ (which notice shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation) and (ii) in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event; _provided_ , _further_ , that
(i) during the Notice Period, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (ii)
the Company shall negotiate, and shall direct its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith during the
Notice Period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that obviate the need of the
board of directors of the Company to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , including in the case
of a Superior Proposal, by such Superior Proposal no longer constituting a
Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, the board of
directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information
provided by Parent and shall have determined (after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that if such changes
were to be given effect that failure to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and, in the case of clause (1) above, any such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of
a Change of Recommendation that is related to an Intervening Event, the
failure to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law) and (iv) in the event
of modifications to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing
of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of any Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in the first proviso of this
paragraph and a new Notice Period under this paragraph shall commence, during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 6.3(c)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (i) through (iv) of this proviso, _provided_ , that any such
additional Notice Period shall end after the third Business Day following
Parents receipt of such notice from the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that a notice is required under this _Section 6.3(c)_
(in connection with a termination 

 



33  pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ ) relates to a Superior Proposal for which the
requisite notice or additional notice has been given pursuant to this _Section
6.3(c)_ (in connection with a Change of Recommendation), no new or additional
notice or Notice Period will be required for such termination pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_.

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (it
being understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains
only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall
not be deemed to have the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Company Recommendation or otherwise deemed to violate the
Companys obligations under this _Section 6.3(d)_ ).

 

(e) _Existing Discussions and Agreements_. The Company agrees that it will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that (i) it will promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person or its Representatives by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not release any party from, or terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality or standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the board of
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to do so, the Company may
waive any standstill or similar provisions in such agreements to the extent
necessary to permit a Person to make on a non-public basis to the board of
directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such
Person agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to compliance with
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the other provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States of America or of any state having jurisdiction. Nothing contained in
this Section 6.3(e) shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from disclosing
any information to the extent necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or any disclosure obligations under applicable U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal.

(f)  _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any
such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto and, in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt, copies of any additional or revised written

reasonable additional time to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement, (iii) if as of

such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt
of the Requisite Company Vote at the Stockholders Meeting or (iv) as required
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Stockholders Meeting
shall not be postponed, recessed or adjourned pursuant to this proviso to a

Business Days if Parent believes in good faith that additional time is
required to solicit stockholder proxies in favor of approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement.

Parent consents (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the Company, with the assistance of Parent and HoldCo, shall

Companys stockholders at the earliest practicable time. Each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and HoldCo shall promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Proxy Statement if

 



35  and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent,
required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of

or supplements to the preliminary Proxy Statement or the definitive Proxy

disbursements) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final
and nonappealable judicial determination that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.12, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

 



41 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and
agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification
agreement with any Indemnified Party in effect as of (and disclosed to
Parent prior to) the date hereof, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any right of any
Indemnified Party thereunder.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only
for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable in any
material respect to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for
a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels
of coverage no less favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified
Parties than that provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual premia of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs. This _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ may not be amended, altered or
repealed after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Party.

 

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant all such
approvals and take all such actions as are necessary or advisable so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or

 



42  minimize the effects of such statute, regulation or provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws on such transactions.

 

Section 6.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company prior to the Effective Time and keep
Parent reasonably apprised on a prompt basis with respect to the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.15 _Notification_. During the period commencing on the date hereof
and terminating upon the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party
in writing of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required under a Material Contract or
otherwise (unless alleged under a Contract that is not material) in
connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any
Actions commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby or (c) any fact, event or circumstance that (i) in the case of the
Company, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and
circumstances, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) has materially impaired, or would reasonably be expected
to materially impair the ability of such party (or, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or (iii) would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, the
failure of any condition precedent to the Companys or Parent and Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger under this Agreement, in each case
within three Business Days of an executive officer of such party becoming
aware of the occurrence of such fact, event or circumstance. Each
such notification shall include a certification of an officer of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, that such notification is being delivered
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. No such notification shall
be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the
purpose of (i) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and
warranties made by the parties in this Agreement or (ii) determining whether
any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied.
Delivery of notification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party
receiving such notice. 

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities
of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

 

Section 6.17 _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or required under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and applicable Law to, contingent on the Effective Time,
(a) ensure that no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or
after the date of this Agreement and (b) if the Closing shall occur prior to
the end of the offering period under the ESPP in existence on the date of this
Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any
such offering period then underway under the ESPP to be determined by
treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time (or such earlier
date as may be determined by the Company in order to properly effectuate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement) as the
last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but
otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall
terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_.

 



43 Section 6.18 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide each employee

") with compensation (including, as applicable, base salary, bonus plans
(based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus payments), severance
benefits, other employee benefits, health and welfare benefits and benefits
under any plan intended to be qualified within the meaning of section 401(a)
of the Code (" _401(k) Plan_ ")) that are at least substantially comparable
in the aggregate to that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ shall (i) create any right in any
Continuing Employee to continued employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit
Plan after the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment, subject to the terms and conditions of
employment agreements, severance plans and change of control plans, in
each case, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(c) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, benefit accrual,
vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any severance, health
or welfare benefit plan, 401(k) Plan or other benefit plan of Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, then Parent
shall ensure that any such plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, benefit
accrual, vesting and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to
the Effective Time under the corresponding plan; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply for benefit accrual purposes or eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan.

 

(d) With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries made available
to Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary shall cause there to be
waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and give effect,
in determining any deductibles and maximum out of pocket limitations, to
claims incurred, amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing
Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, honor, in accordance with its terms (including any
provisions regarding the termination and amendment of such plans), each
Company Benefit Plan and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or
benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either
alone or in combination with any other event, including termination of
employment). Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of
the Merger constitutes a change of control, change in control or similar
event, as the case may be, to the extent applicable under any plan, agreement
or arrangement set forth in Section 4.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(f) With respect to the annual bonus for which any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is eligible under any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys annual incentive plans with respect to any year, if any, prior to
the Effective Time, the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
administer each such plan (including the payment of all amounts owed
thereunder at the ordinary time) in accordance with its terms consistent with
past practices in the ordinary course of business.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the

of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto
(or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages (which
the parties acknowledge and agree, in the case of liabilities or damages
payable by Parent, Merger Sub or HoldCo would include the benefits of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement lost by the holders of the
Shares, the Company Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares and
Company Performance Awards, which shall be deemed to be damages of the
Company) resulting from any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement and
(ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 6.9(c)_ (Financing -
Indemnification), _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (Expenses), this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_,
_Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the

 



47  termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful
Breach_ " shall mean a material breach of, or failure to perform any of the
covenants or other agreements contained in, this Agreement, that is a
consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing
Person with actual knowledge, or knowledge that a Person acting reasonably
under the circumstances should have, that such Persons act or failure to act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in or constitute a breach of
or failure of performance under this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) By Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (Termination Date)
and in connection therewith:

 

(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed after the date
hereof and not expressly withdrawn in good faith prior to the Termination
Date; and

(B) within 12 months after termination of this Agreement, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this clause _(B)_ ,
the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a reference to "50%") (any such agreement or consummation, an "
_Acquisition Event_ "),

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two Business
Days of consummation of such Acquisition Event;

 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ (Alternative Acquisition
Agreement), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee prior to
or concurrently with such termination; or

(iii) by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (Change of Recommendation;
Company Recommendation) (other than _Section 8.4(c)_ ) (any termination
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be a termination fee
trigger), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two
Business Days of such termination.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean
$215,000,000. No Acquisition Proposal made by a Person shall be deemed to have
been "expressly withdrawn," in the event that the Company later agrees within
the 12-month period specified in _Section 8.5(b)(_ _i_ _)(B)_ to or
consummates an Acquisition Event with such Person or an Affiliate thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (y) the parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with
respect to this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable and is paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company
(and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have no
further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that a Termination Fee becomes due and is paid
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, Parent shall have the right
to refund such Termination Fee in its entirety within five Business Days
after the payment of the Termination Fee by the Company, and if Parent does so
refund the Termination Fee in its entirety to the Company within such five
Business Day period, the Company shall not be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its Willful Breach of _Section_ __ _
6.3_ of this Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to all
remedies available as contemplated by _Section 8.5(a)_. If Parent fails to
exercise its right to refund the Termination Fee in accordance with the
proviso set forth in the previous sentence, Parent shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any and all rights and remedies set forth in _Section
8.5(a)_ and the Company and its Representatives shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section 8.5(b)_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination
Fee and, in order to obtain

 



48  such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a
Judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee (or a portion thereof),
the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
the fee at the prime rate published in the Money Rates section of The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
All payments under _Section 8.5(b)_ shall be made promptly by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
receiving such payment.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal or other state court located in the State of Delaware) solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the

 



49  interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or only if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
located in the State of Delaware). The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to any financing commitment or the Debt Financing or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, Borough of Manhattan or, if under applicable Law, exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof).

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING UNDER ANY FINANCING
COMMITMENT). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _
9.5_.

 

(d) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by any party in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such party.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE _ _VIII_ , the non-breaching parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
other party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement against the other party, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in
connection therewith. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE_ _VIII_ , each party hereby agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity.

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits
hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and
the letter agreement, dated March 26, 2017, between JAB Forest B.V. (an
Affiliate of Parent) and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")

understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS

 



51  OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR
THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

Section 9.8  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section_
__ _ 6.12_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and in
_Section 6.9(c)_ (Financing - Indemnification), Parent and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party
beneficiaries of Section 9.2, Section 9.5, this Section 9.8 and Section 9.14.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.3_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires Merger Sub or another Affiliate of Parent to take any
action, Parent shall be liable for any failure of such Person to take such
action. Whenever this Agreement requires any Subsidiary of the Company to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 9.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined
in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.12 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to a Section of, Annex to or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like
import used in this Agreement shall refer to this

 



52  Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Terms defined in the singular shall also include the plural and vice versa. A
reference in this Agreement to $ or dollars is to U.S. dollars.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may designate,
by written notice to the Company, another of its Affiliates to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Affiliate,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Affiliate as of the date of
such designation and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their
respective rights and obligations hereunder to a lender as collateral, in each
case after providing written notice thereof to the Company prior to such
designation or assignment; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such designation
or assignment shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially
impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 

Section 9.14 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of
any party hereto or of any of their respective Affiliates (unless such
Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement) shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of such
party arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ shall limit any liability of the parties to this
Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that none of the Financing
Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein (including with respect to the Debt Financing). The
Company and its Affiliates hereby waive any and all claims and causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
the Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, any financing commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (including the Debt Financing). This Section 9.14(b) is intended to
benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company. 

Section 9.15 _HoldCo_ _Obligation_. HoldCo hereby agrees to cause Parent to
perform its payment obligations under this Agreement, and to be held liable
for any breach by Parent of such obligations as though it were Parent. HoldCo
hereby represents and warrants that (i) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and do not contravene any provision of HoldCos
governing documents or any Law or contractual restriction binding on HoldCo or
its assets, (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of HoldCo enforceable against HoldCo in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions and (iii) HoldCo has
currently, and will have on the Closing Date, the financial capacity (which,
other than on the Closing Date, may include access to available borrowings or
liquid assets) to pay and perform the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and
HoldCo under this Agreement, and all funds necessary for HoldCo to fulfill the
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and HoldCo shall be available to HoldCo.

 



53 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written

director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or
modification of this Article FIFTH by the stockholders of the Corporation
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect
to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by
statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to
exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the
GCL, this Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the
stockholders; provided, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have
been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

_SIXTH:_



     | 1. |

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or witness,
or is threatened to be made a party or witness, to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding (including, without limitation, an
action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation), whether
civil,  

---|---|--- jury proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she (a) is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or, (b) as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent,
partner or trustee (or in any similar position) of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by the GCL and
any other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,
in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said
law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal thereof;
provided, however, that, except as provided in Clause TWO of this Article
SIXTH hereof with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification,
the Corporation shall indemnify any such person in connection with an action,
suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if
the initiation of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors. Such right to indemnification shall
include the right to payment by the Corporation of expenses incurred in
connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by
a director, officer, employee or agent in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director, officer,
employee or agent, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined
ultimately that such director, officer, employee or agent is not entitled to
be indemnified under this Article SIXTH or otherwise. 
---|--- 



     | 2. | Any indemnification or advancement of expenses required under
this Article SIXTH shall be made promptly, and in any event within sixty days,
upon the written request of the person entitled thereto. If a determination
by the Corporation that the person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article SIXTH is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within
sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed
to have approved such request. If the Corporation denies a written request
for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment
in full pursuant to such request is not made within sixty days, the right to
indemnification and advancement of expenses as granted by this Article SIXTH
shall be enforceable by the person in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such action or proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce
a claim for the advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article SIXTH where
the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the GCL, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or the stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the GCL, nor the fact that there has been an actual
determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or the stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 3. |

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article SIXTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person. Any repeal or modification of
the provisions of this Article SIXTH shall not affect any obligations of the
Corporation or any rights regarding indemnification and advancement
of expenses of a director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding for which
indemnification or the advancement of 

---|---|--- accrued at any time prior to such repeal or modification. 
---|--- 
 



     | 4. | The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by
him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her
against such liability under the provisions of this Article SIXTH, the GCL or
otherwise. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5. | If this Article SIXTH or any portion thereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and
agent of the Corporation as to expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
including, without limitation, a grand jury proceeding and an action, suit or
proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent
permitted by any applicable portion of this Article SIXTH that shall not have
been invalidated, by the GCL or by any other applicable law. 
---|---|--- 

_SEVENTH:_ Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept
(subject to any provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of Delaware
at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the Corporation.

_EIGHTH:_ The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
