the Corporation that the person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article SIXTH is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved
such request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within sixty days, the right to indemnification and advancement of

where the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the GCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or the stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she

met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. </TD></TR></TABLE>
