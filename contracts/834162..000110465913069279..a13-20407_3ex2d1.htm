committee, as applicable, and Parent, Parents Board, and its compensation
committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
that are necessary, including obtaining any necessary consents and providing
any necessary notices, to (i) effectuate the provisions of _Sections 1.12(a)_
through _1.12(c)_.

 



 

(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to equity
awards converted pursuant to _Section 1.12_.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Tax Consequences_. For federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that the Mergers, taken together, shall be treated as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be mutually agreed by
MTR and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which agreement shall provide
that Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time, for
the benefit of the holders of shares of MTR Common Stock and the Company
Membership Interests, as applicable, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent, an aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a record date
after the Effective Time, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") representing the Company Merger Consideration and the MTR Merger
Consideration (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ that for
purposes of establishing the Exchange Fund, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock included in the Company Merger Consideration shall be deemed to
be the Estimated Aggregate Company Merger Shares minus the amount of the
Escrowed Parent Shares (such number of shares, the " _Up-Front Company Merger
Shares_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to the Exchange Agent a schedule (the " _Merger Member Schedule_
") setting forth the name, contact information and such other information as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably require of each Merger Member and the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (not to exceed in the aggregate the Estimated
Aggregate Company Merger Shares) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that each Merger Member is entitled to receive as of the
Effective Time (which shall take into account the operation of the Merger
Member Side Agreement). Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail (x) to each Merger Member set forth in the
Merger Member Schedule and (y) to each holder of record of certificate(s)
representing shares of MTR Common Stock who theretofore has not submitted such
holders Election Form (all such certificates, together with certificate(s)
representing shares of MTR Common Stock previously submitted with an Election
Form, " _Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.10_ (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify to the holders of Certificates that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) to the Exchange Agent in a form to be mutually agreed upon by
Company and MTR (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for
use in surrendering Certificate(s) for shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. In the event
that the waivers set forth in _Section 5.14_ and _5.15_ are not obtained, no
Election Form shall be required of holders of MTR Common Stock.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender by a holder of MTR Common Stock to the Exchange Agent of
its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal
or, to the extent received prior to the Election Deadline, a properly
completed Election Form, such holder of MTR Common Stock will be entitled to
receive (and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each such
holder) promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Sections 2.8_ and _2.9_
, the MTR Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_ in respect of
the MTR Common Stock represented by such holders Certificate(s). Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time,
for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the MTR Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

 



 

(c) Upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal by a Merger Member, such Merger Member will be entitled to receive
(and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each such holder)
promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Sections 2.8_ and _2.9_ , the
number of Up-Front Company Merger Shares and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock set forth with respect to such Merger Member in
the Merger Member Schedule and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Article II_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and
until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(k)_ ) in accordance with this _Article
II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not
paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of MTR or the Company of the MTR Common Stock or Company
Membership Interests, respectively, that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares or units are presented for transfer to
the Exchange Agent, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock).

 



 

(f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share
interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of
MTR Common Stock or Company Membership Interests who otherwise would have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu
thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all shares of MTR Common Stock or Company
Membership Interests owned by such holder at the Company Effective Time or the
MTR Effective Time, respectively, to be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock) by the Implied Price Per Share.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of MTR or former Merger Members as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time may, at Parents option, be paid to Parent (together with
any dividends in respect thereof). In such event, any former holder of MTR
Common Stock or Company Membership Interests who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each such share of MTR Common Stock or each Company Membership
Interest such former holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon. The Exchange Agent will notify Parent prior to
the time that any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed would
have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws and, at Parents option, such portion shall
be paid to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, MTR, the
Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of MTR Common Stock or Company

 



      
 

 



 

Membership Interests for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange
Fund pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ and any losses resulting from such
investments will be made up by Parent to the extent that such losses cause the
total amount of cash in the Exchange Fund to fall below the amount necessary
to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(j) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who
was a holder of MTR Common Stock or Company Membership Interests, as the case
may be, immediately prior to the MTR Effective Time or the Company Effective
Time, as the case may be, such amounts as Parent and the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent and duly
paid over to the applicable taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(k) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by MTR, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
in such form as MTR and the Company shall mutually agree (the " _Election
Form_ ") shall be mailed thirty-five (35) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date or on such other date as MTR and the Company shall mutually agree
(the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of MTR Common Stock as of
the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the
" _Election Form Record Date_ ").

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(A) the number of shares of such holders MTR Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (B) the number of shares of such holders MTR
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration (" _Cash Election Shares_ ") or (C) that such holder makes
no election with respect to such holders MTR Common Stock (" _No Election
Shares_ "). Any MTR Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the 30th day following the Mailing Date (or such
other time and date as MTR and the Company may mutually agree) (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") shall also be deemed to be No Election Shares.

 



 

(c) MTR shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by any person who becomes a holder (or beneficial
owner) of MTR Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close
of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline.

 



 

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more MTR Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of MTR
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form only by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, unless a
subsequent properly completed Election Form is submitted and actually received
by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the shares of MTR Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and MTR
shall cause the applicable Certificates to be promptly returned without charge
to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect
from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of MTR or the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, MTR or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
aggregate of the Per Share Cash Consideration to be received pursuant to
_clause (B)_ of _Section 1.10(a)(ii)_ shall in no event exceed Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000.00) (such number of shares, the " _Cash Election Shares
Limit_ ").

 



 

(f) Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the former holders of
MTR Common Stock of rights to receive the MTR Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash Election Shares is
greater than the Cash Election Shares Limit, then:

 



 

(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

 



 

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the
aggregate number of shares of MTR Common Stock that will be paid the Per Share
Cash Consideration equals the Cash Election Shares Limit, and all Stock
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Cash Not Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash Election
Shares is less than or equal to the Cash Election Shares Limit, then:

 



 

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(B) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be determined by Parent. For
the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of _Section 2.3_ , MTR Restricted Shares
shall be treated as MTR Common Stock.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Subject to the provisions of _Sections 5.1_ and
_5.2_ , in the event that MTR changes the number of shares of MTR Common Stock
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
MTR Common Stock, or the Company changes the number of Company Membership
Interests or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Company Membership Interests, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time, in each case as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, merger, subdivision,
exchange, or other similar transaction, the Company Ratio and/or MTR Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted as appropriate.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of outstanding shares of MTR
Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments to this _Article II_ as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that this _Article II_ has with respect
to Company Membership Interests and MTR Common Stock that are represented by
Certificates.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Company Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) Subject to determination and adjustment in accordance with _Sections 2.8_
and _2.9_ , respectively, the total consideration (the " _Company Merger
Consideration_ ") to be paid

 



      
 

 



 

to the Merger Members in connection with the Company Merger shall be equal to
the following amount:

 



 

(i) the product of (x) the Adjusted Company EBITDA for the twelve months
ending on the last day of the most recent month preceding the Closing Date by
at least twenty (20) days (the " _Report Date_ ") and (y) 6.81, _minus_

 



 

(ii) Closing Company Debt, _plus_

 



 

(iii) Closing Company Cash, _minus_

 



 

(iv) Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital Shortfall (if any), _plus_

 



 

(v) Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital Surplus (if any), _plus_

 



 

(vi) the $5,000,000 of restricted cash on the Companys balance sheet (if any)
relating to the credit support required in connection with the Companys
interest in SLJV, _plus_

 



 

(vii) the SLJV Component (if any), _plus_

 



 

(viii) the MTR Excess Expense Amount (if any).

 



 

The total number (the " _Aggregate Company Merger Shares_ ") of shares of
Parent Common Stock (after rounding down to the nearest whole share) shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Company Merger Consideration by
the Implied Per Share Price. The " _SLJV Component_ " shall be an amount equal
to the following amount:

 



 

(A) the product of (i) the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and (ii) the difference
between the Capital Accounts (as such term is defined in SLJVs operating
agreement) of ELLC and the other Member (as such term is defined in SLJVs
operating agreement), _plus_

 



 

(B) the product of (i) the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and (ii) the product of the
Adjusted SLJV EBITDA for the twelve months ending on the Report Date
multiplied by 6.81, _minus_

 



 

(C) the product of the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and the Closing SLJV Debt, _plus_

 



 

(D) the product of the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and the Closing SLJV Cash, _plus_

 



 

(E) the product of the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and the Closing SLJV Adjusted Net
Working Capital Surplus (if any), _minus_

 



 

(F) the product of the SLJV-ELLC Percentage and the Closing SLJV Adjusted Net
Working Capital Shortfall (if any), _plus_

 



      
 

 



 

(G) the face value of the SLJV Partner Notes.

 



 

The " _MTR Excess Expense Amount_ " means the aggregate of (I) the lesser of
the MTR Transaction Expenses and Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000.00) plus
(II) an amount equal to the Excess Regulatory Fee, but only in the event that
MTR makes the election contemplated in _Section 7.1(c)(iv)_. The " _SLJV-ELLC
Percentage_ " shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing the ownership
interests of SLJV directly held by ELLC as of the Closing Date, after taking
into effect any transactions permitted pursuant to _Section 5.21(a)_ , by the
aggregate ownership interests of SLJV outstanding as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) A sample calculation of the Merger Consideration and its components,
together with the policies, procedures and methodologies (if any) to be used
in calculating the Company Merger Consideration and its components, is set
forth on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Sample Company Merger Consideration Calculation_
"). The Company Merger Consideration to be paid at Closing shall be determined
in accordance with the Sample Company Merger Consideration Calculation and
paid to the Merger Members, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Not less than thirteen (13) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if
such date is within thirteen (13) Business Days of the Termination Date, then
as soon as reasonably practicable on or prior to the Closing Date), MTR shall
prepare and deliver to the Company for its review a report (the " _Draft
Preliminary MTR Expense Report_ ") setting forth a schedule with a calculation
of an estimate of MTR Excess Expense Amount. Not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (or if such date is within ten (10) Business
Days of the Termination Date, then as soon as reasonably practicable on or
prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent
for its review a report (the " _Draft Preliminary Closing Report_ ") setting
forth each of the following: (i) a statement of an estimate of Adjusted
Company EBITDA as of the Report Date (the " _Estimated Adjusted Company
EBITDA_ "), (ii) an estimated unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the
Closing Date of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the Company Audited Financial
Statements, (iii) a statement of an estimate of Closing Company Debt (the "
_Estimated Closing Company Debt_ ") and of Closing Company Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Company Cash_ "), (iv) a schedule with a calculation of an
estimate of Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing
Adjusted Net Working Capital_ ") and any estimated Closing Adjusted Net
Working Capital Shortfall or estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital
Surplus, as applicable, (v) a schedule with a calculation of the SLJV
Component (the " _Estimated SLJV Component_ "), (vi) an estimate of the MTR
Excess Expense Amount based on the estimate thereof set forth in the Draft
Preliminary MTR Expense Report (the " _Estimated MTR Excess Expense Amount_
"), (vii) a schedule of the calculation, determined in accordance with the
Sample Company Merger Consideration Calculation, of the Company Merger
Consideration based on such estimates, (viii) the Total Outstanding Company
Membership Interests, and (ix) detailed supporting calculations, documentation
and data setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of its
calculations with respect to each of the foregoing. Parent shall have a
reasonable opportunity to discuss the Draft Preliminary Closing Report with
the Company and review such report and the underlying books and records of the
Company related thereto. If Parent objects to any amount reflected on the
Draft Preliminary Closing Report, Parent and the Company shall in good faith
attempt to resolve such objection and agree to such amounts prior to the
Closing. The " _Preliminary Closing Report_ " shall be

 



      
 

 



 

(x) the Draft Preliminary Closing Report revised to reflect any modifications
agreed to by the Company and Parent and, with respect to any item contained in
the Draft Preliminary Closing Report that the parties are unable to resolve,
shall be deemed, solely for purposes of determining the Preliminary Closing
Report, but subject in all respects to adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ,
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the sum of (A) the estimate
prepared in good faith by the Company contained in the Draft Preliminary
Closing Report and (B) Parents good faith estimate of such item, by (II) two
(2), or (y) if there are no agreed-upon modifications or outstanding disputes,
the Draft Preliminary Closing Report shall be the Preliminary Closing Report;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion of, or the failure to include, as
applicable, any changes proposed by Parent or the failure by Parent to propose
any changes, shall not constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of the accuracy
of any item in the Draft Preliminary Closing Report, including but not limited
to the Estimated Adjusted Company EBITDA, the Estimated Closing Company Debt,
the Estimated Closing Company Cash, the Estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital, the Estimated MTR Excess Expense Amount and the Estimated SLJV
Component. The amount of the Merger Consideration as set forth on the
Preliminary Closing Report shall be the " _Estimated Company Merger
Consideration_ ," and the number of shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Estimated Company
Merger Consideration divided by the Implied Per Share Price shall be the "
_Estimated Aggregate Company Merger Shares._ "

 



 

(d) At 12:01 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (or at such other day or
time as mutually agreed by the Parties), the Company shall conduct a physical
count of all Cage Cash (and any other Cash required to be counted in
connection with the Mergers by any Gaming Authority) held by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Gaming Properties (the " _Cash Count_ ").
The Cash Count shall be conducted in accordance with the policies, procedures
and methodologies set forth on Section 2.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and in this _Section 2.6(d)_. Each of Parent, the Company and the Member
Representative shall be entitled to have Representatives present during the
Cash Count, which Representatives shall have full access to the Cash Count
proceedings and cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding the
conduct of the Cash Count. The results of the Cash Count shall, absent
manifest error, be binding on the Parties for the purpose of determining the
Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including
_Section 5.1_ ), the Company shall have the right, exercisable in their sole
discretion, to pay all or any portion of the expenses or costs incurred by the
Company prior to the Closing on the Closing Date. Any payments of such
expenses or costs pursuant to this _Section 2.2(e)_ shall, if not previously
taken into account in determining the Estimated Company Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ , be taken into account in the adjustment of
the Company Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Escrowed Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) On the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its transfer agent for Parent Common Stock (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") to
electronically

 



      
 

 



 

transfer, by crediting the account of the prime broker of the Escrow Agent
with The Depositary Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") through its Deposit/Withdrawal
At Custodian system (the " _DWAC System_ "), such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Escrowed Parent Shares_ ") equal to the quotient of
$2,000,000 _divided by_ the Implied Per Share Price, which shares the Escrow
Agent shall deposit in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ")
established in accordance with an escrow agreement to be entered into among
Parent, the Member Representative and the Escrow Agent, consistent with the
terms set forth in this Agreement and other customary terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company for similar agreements (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall terminate no sooner than the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the final determination of the Adjusted
Company Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.9_. The Escrow Agreement
shall provide that Parent is, for federal income tax purposes, the owner of
the Escrowed Parent Shares and is taxable on any earnings thereon. If any
payment is required to be made to Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ ,
Parent and the Member Representative shall promptly provide written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, to deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Account an amount of Parent
Common Stock that in the aggregate is equal in value to such required payment,
with each share of Parent Common Stock valued for these purposes at the
Implied Per Share Price.

 



 

(b) In the event the Estimated Company Merger Consideration is more than the
Adjusted Company Merger Consideration following the determination of the
Adjusted Company Merger Consideration and subject to _Section 2.9(e)_ , Parent
is hereby irrevocably authorized to set off against the Escrow Parent Stock, a
number of shares (the " _Set-Off Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the
number of shares (the " _Parent True-Up Shares_ ") equal to (A) the amount by
which the Estimated Company Merger Consideration exceeds the Adjusted Company
Merger Consideration _divided by_ (B) the Implied Per Share Price and (ii) the
aggregate number of Escrowed Parent Shares. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Escrow Agent to cause the Set-Off Shares to be
electronically transferred, by crediting the account of the prime broker of
the Transfer Agent with DTC through its DWAC System for Parents account
within five (5) Business Days following such determination. Any such shares
shall be treated as unissued treasury shares of Parent. To the extent that the
number of shares of Escrowed Parent Shares exceeds the Set-Off Shares, Parent
shall cause the Escrow Agent to release and deliver to each Merger Member its
Pro Rata Portion of such excess number of shares of Parent Common Stock within
the same five (5) Business Day period.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Escrow Agent or Parent is to distribute any of the
Company Merger Consideration (including any of the Aggregate Company Merger
Shares) to the Merger Members (including pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ or
_2.9(h)_ ), then such Company Merger Consideration shall be distributed to the
Merger Members in the proportions set forth in the Merger Member Schedule
(such Merger Members " _Pro Rata Portion_ "). In the event that the Merger
Members are required hereunder to return any Company Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.9(g)_ , each Merger Member shall have the several
obligation to return its Pro Rata Portion of such Company Merger
Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.9 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Member Representative and the Stockholders Representative
for their respective review a report (the " _Post-Closing Report_ "),
substantially in the form of the Preliminary Closing Report, setting forth
each of the following: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the
Closing Date of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis
consistent with the Company Audited Financial Statements, (ii) a statement
with Parents calculations, in accordance with the Sample Merger Consideration

(e) If the Member Representative and Parent, on the one hand, and Parent and
the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, have not resolved all

Cash, Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, the SLJV Component, and the MTR
Excess Expense Amount (in each case, if and to the extent disputed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Member Representative, the Stockholders
Representative and Parent are unable to select such accounting firm within the

resolve such remaining Disputed Items within the range of the difference
between Parents position with respect thereto and the Member Representatives

determination of any disputed amount will be within (and not outside of) the
upper and lower bounds set forth by Parent and the Member Representative or
the Stockholders Representative, as applicable, for such amount, except where
the Member Representative and the Stockholders Representative have the same
Disputed Item, then the larger upper and lower bounds for such amount shall be

setting forth in reasonable detail (A) its determination as to each Disputed
Item, (B) its calculation of Adjusted Company EBITDA as of the Report Date,
Closing Company Debt, Closing Company Cash, Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital, SLJV Component and MTR Excess Expense Amount based on its

accompanied by a certificate from the Independent Accounting Firm that it
reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.9(e)_. The Accountants Report shall be final and binding on the parties for
all purposes hereunder, and the parties acknowledge and agree that judgment
may be entered upon the Accountants Report in any competent court.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by
Parent. Each party shall bear its own costs (and that of its Representatives)
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Post-Closing
Report and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable.
In the event that either the Member Representative or the Stockholders
Representative becomes obligated to pay out-of-pocket costs related to its
performance under this _Section 2.9_ , Parent shall pay such expense and
documented out-of-pocket costs, and the Adjusted Company Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.9(i)_. The Escrow Agent shall,
within five (5) Business Days following such determination, cause such number
of shares to be electronically transferred, by crediting the account of the
prime broker of the Transfer Agent with DTC through its DWAC System for
Parents account. Any such shares will be treated as unissued treasury shares
of Parent.

 



 

(f) The Estimated Company Merger Consideration shall be adjusted (the
Estimated Company Merger Consideration as so adjusted, the " _Adjusted Company
Merger Consideration_ "):

 



 

(i) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Debt, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is greater than Estimated Closing
Company Debt;

 



 

(ii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Debt, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is less than Estimated Closing
Company Debt;

 



 

(iii) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Cash, as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is less than Estimated
Closing Company Cash;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Cash, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is greater than Estimated Closing
Company Cash;

 



 

(v) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is less than
Estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 



 

(vi) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is greater
than Estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 



 

(vii) upwards by the amount (if any) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) 6.81 by (y) the amount by which the Adjusted Company EBITDA as
of the Report Date, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is
greater than the Adjusted Company EBITDA as of the Report Date, as set forth
on the Preliminary Closing Report;

 



 

(viii) downwards by the amount (if any) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) 6.81 by (y) the amount by which the Adjusted Company EBITDA as
of the Report Date, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is
less than the Adjusted Company EBITDA as of the Report Date, as set forth on
the Preliminary Closing Report;

 



 

(ix) downwards by the amount (if any) by which the SLJV Component, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is less than the Estimated SLJV
Component; and

 



 

(x) upwards by the amount (if any) by which the SLJV Component, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is greater than the Estimated SLJV
Component.

 



 

(xi) downwards by the amount (if any) by which the MTR Excess Expense Amount,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is less than the
Estimated MTR Excess Expense Amount; and

 



 

(xii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which the MTR Excess Expense Amount,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ , is greater than the MTR
Excess Expense Amount.

 



 

(g) If the Adjusted Company Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Company Merger Consideration, then (x) Parent shall have the right to set-off
against the Set-Off Shares, and (y) any remaining balance of the Escrowed
Parent Shares after such set-off shall be distributed to the Merger Members,
in each case, in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_. If the number of Parent
True-Up Shares exceeds the Set-Off Shares (such excess, the " _Company
Escrowed Shortfall_ "), then within five (5) Business Days following such
determination, Parent shall mail to each Merger Member a statement (the "
_Parent Shortfall Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the number of shares of the
Company Escrowed Shortfall, (ii) such Merger Members Pro Rata Portion of the
Company Escrowed Shortfall (as determined in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_
), and (iii) the delivery instructions pursuant to which the Merger Members
shall return their

 



       
 

 



 

respective Pro Rata Portion of the Company Escrowed Shortfall to the Transfer
Agent within five (5) Business Days following the mailing date of Parent
Shortfall Notice in accordance with their respective Merger Member
Undertaking.

 



 

(h) If the Adjusted Company Merger Consideration equals or exceeds the
Estimated Company Merger Consideration (the amount of shares equal to the
amount of such excess (if any) divided by the Implied Per Share Price, the "
_Company True-Up Shares_ "), then Parent shall cause the Escrow Agent, in
accordance with _Section 2.8_ , to distribute to each Merger Member its Pro
Rata Portion of all of the Escrowed Parent Shares. If the number of Company
True-Up Shares is greater than zero, within five (5) Business Days following
such determination, Parent shall issue to each Merger Member its Pro Rata
Portion (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Company True-Up Shares.

 



 

(i) In the event that Parent pays any costs of the Member Representative in
accordance with _Section 2.9(e)_ , Parent shall set-off such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Account, in an amount equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the amount of such costs by the Implied Per
Share Price and reduce the Adjusted Company Merger Consideration by the same
amount. In the event that Parent pays any costs of the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with _Section 2.9(e)_ or the monthly retainer of
the Stockholder Representative in accordance with _Section 8.18(c)_ , Parent
shall increase the MTR Transaction Expenses by the amount of such costs or
such retainer (as the case may be) for purposes of determining the Adjusted
Company Merger Consideration.

delay the Closing. Each of the Company Licensed Parties, and to the knowledge

Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Company Licensing Affiliates, has
received notice of any investigation or review by any Gaming Authority or
other Governmental Entity with respect to the Company, SLJV, their respective
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Company Licensing Affiliates or

Licensed Parties, or any of their respective Company Licensing Affiliates or
Company Management Principals. None of the Company Licensed Parties, and none
of their respective Company Licensing Affiliates or Company Management

such controls were effective and MTRs independent registered accountant has
issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that MTR maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012. To the knowledge of MTR, since January 1,
2013, none of MTR, its Subsidiaries or MTRs independent registered accountant
has identified or been made aware of: (A) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over

compliance with any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Vote/Approval Required_. Assuming the presence of a quorum at the
MTR Stockholders Meeting, this Agreement will be adopted upon the receipt of
the affirmative vote of

 



      
 

 



 

a majority of the outstanding shares of MTR Common Stock entitled to vote

Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of MTR is necessary to approve this Agreement or
the MTR Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of MTR as the sole stockholder of Parent and Merger Sub A and the sole
member of Merger Sub B (each of which shall have occurred prior to the

Section 4.11 _Licensability_. None of MTR, any of its Subsidiaries, any of
their respective officers, directors, partners, managers, members, principals
or Affiliates which may reasonably be considered in the process of determining
the suitability of the MTR Entities for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming
Authority, or, to MTRs knowledge, any holders of MTRs capital stock or other
equity interests who will be required to be licensed or found suitable under
applicable Gaming Laws (the foregoing Persons collectively, the " _MTR
Licensing Affiliates_ "), has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in
response to a communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or
impending denial, suspension or revocation) or been denied or

 



      
 

 



 

had suspended or revoked a Gaming Approval, or an application for a Gaming
Approval, by a Gaming Authority. MTR, its Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective MTR Licensing Affiliates which is licensed or holds any Gaming
Approval pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws (collectively, the " _MTR Licensed
Parties_ ") is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which such MTR
Licensed Party owns, operates, or manages gaming facilities. To MTRs
knowledge, there are no facts which, if known to any Gaming Authority, would
be reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial, revocation, limitation or
suspension of a Gaming Approval of any of the MTR Licensed Parties or (ii)
result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings of any
of the MTR Licensed Parties currently pending, or under the suitability
proceedings necessary for the consummation of the Mergers.

(a) Each of the MTR Licensed Parties, and to MTRs knowledge, each of the MTR
Licensed Parties directors, officers, partners, managers, members, key
employees and Persons performing management functions similar to those
performed by officers, partners, or managers, holds all Gaming Approvals and
all such Permits as are necessary to conduct the business and operations of
the MTR Licensed Parties as currently conducted, each of which is in full
force and effect in all respects, and no event has occurred which permits, or
upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both would permit, revocation,
non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Permit
that currently is in effect, the loss of which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to impair or delay the Closing. Each of
the MTR Licensed Parties, and to the knowledge of MTR, each of the MTR
Licensed Parties respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members,
key employees and Persons performing management functions similar to those
performed by officers, partners, or managers (collectively, " _MTR Management
Principals_ "), is in compliance with the terms of such Permits, except for
such failures to comply which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to impair or delay the Closing. No MTR Entity, nor any of
their respective MTR Licensing Affiliates, has received notice of any
investigation or review by any Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity
with respect to any MTR Entity, or any of their respective MTR Licensing
Affiliates or MTR Management Principals that is pending, and, to the knowledge
of MTR, no investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Gaming Authority
or other Governmental Entity indicated any intention to conduct the same,
other than those the outcome of which would not impair or delay the Closing.

 



 

(b) No MTR Licensed Party, and no MTR Licensing Affiliate or MTR Management
Principal of any MTR Licensed Party, has received any written claim, demand,
notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Entity in the past three years under, or
relating to any violation or possible violation of, any Gaming Law which did
or would be reasonably likely to result in an individual fine or penalty of
$25,000 or more. To the knowledge of MTR, there are no facts which if known to
any Gaming Authority could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval or other license, finding of
suitability, registration, permit or approval of the Licensed Parties, or any
of their respective MTR Licensing Affiliates or MTR Management Principals.
None of the MTR Licensed Parties, and none of their respective MTR Licensing
Affiliates or MTR Management Principals, has suffered a suspension, denial,
non-renewal, limitation or revocation of any Permit.

MTR or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed in accordance with all
applicable Laws (after giving effect to any extensions of time in which to

all respects. There is no outstanding claim in writing by any Governmental

a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
initiated by MTR or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date without the
consent of the Company; or (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or other Tax law)

schedules.

 



 

(b) With respect to the MTR Plans:

 



 

(i) each MTR Plan has been established and administered in accordance with its
terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code,
and no prohibited transaction, as described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section

have been timely made;

 



 

(iii) each MTR Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code

to the knowledge of MTR, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified status
of such MTR Plan;

 



 

(iv) no MTR Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code;

 



 

(v) no MTR Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA);

 



 

(vi) MTR and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any MTR Plan that is a "group
health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) that
has not been administered and operated in all respects in compliance with the
applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA and Section 4980B(b) of the
Code, and MTR and its Subsidiaries are not

 



      
 

 



 

subject to any liability, including additional contributions, fines, penalties
or loss of Tax deduction, as a result of such administration and operation;

 



 

(vii) no MTR Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability of any of
MTR and its Subsidiaries to provide, post-termination or retiree life
insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-

except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Law, and none of MTR,
any Subsidiary or any entity, trade or business, whether or not incorporated,

Code;

 



 

(viii) except as set forth in _Section 1.12_ , no MTR Plan provides for
payment of a benefit, the increase of a benefit amount, the payment of a
contingent benefit or the acceleration of the payment or vesting of a benefit
determined or occasioned, in whole or in part, by reason of the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with another event). No amount or other
entitlement that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting
of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any individuals under any MTR Plan will be an "excess parachute
payment," as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. MTR has
not taken any action with respect to 2013 annual incentive awards and/or 2014
annual incentive awards that would cause such awards to be nondeductible under

excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code;

409A Authorities and has not been operated in compliance with the 409A
Authorities (except to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to
result in a liability); and

 



 

(x) there are no Actions, audits or inquiries pending, or, to the knowledge of

such MTR Plan.

on the one hand, and each landlord or sublandlord, on the other hand, with
respect to the MTR Leased Real Property.

other parties thereto, except as such enforcement may be limited by (A)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership and other
laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors,
and (B) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or Law. There does not exist (x) under
any Lease any material default by MTR or any Subsidiary or, to MTRs
knowledge, by any other Person, or (y) any event that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default by MTR or any Subsidiary or, to MTRs
knowledge, by any other Person.

 



 

(ii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, in connection with such MTR Leases, (A) impose any penalty or additional

successor in interest to MTR, or (B) cause a breach or default with respect to
any Lease.

 



 

(iii) MTR or a Subsidiary is the holder of the tenants interest under each of
the MTR Leases and neither MTR nor any Subsidiary has assigned the MTR Leases
or subleased all or any portion of the premises leased thereunder. MTR has not
made any alterations, additions or improvements to the premises leased under
the MTR Leases that are expressly required to be removed pursuant to the
applicable Lease at the termination of the applicable Lease term.

 



 

(c) All improvements on the MTR Real Property owned by, leased to, or used by
MTR (i) to the knowledge of MTR substantially conform to all applicable state
and local Laws, including zoning and building ordinances and health and safety
ordinances, and to the knowledge of MTR, such MTR Real Property is zoned for
the various purposes for which the MTR Real Property and improvements thereon
are presently being used, (ii) are in good repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and are suitable for the use presently being made of such
improvements by MTR and (iii) together with all MTR Real Property and other
tangible personal property and assets owned, leased and used by MTR or any of
its Subsidiaries, are adequate and sufficient for the operation of the
business of MTR as presently conducted.

 



 

(d) The machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal
property and assets owned, leased, or used by MTR or any of its Subsidiaries
are (i) to the knowledge of MTR, in good operating condition, subject to
normal wear and tear, (ii) are reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for
which they are being used, and (iii) comply in all

 



      
 

 



 

respects with, and are being operated and otherwise used in compliance with,
all applicable Laws.

 



 

(e) MTR or a Subsidiary of MTR owns and has good and valid title to all of
their respective owned tangible personal property and assets and has valid
leasehold interests in all of its leased properties and assets, used or held
for use in their respective businesses as currently conducted, free and clear
of all Liens (except in all cases for those permissible under any applicable
loan agreements and indentures and for title exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens, charges, restrictions, restrictive covenants and other
matters, whether or not of record, which do not affect the continued use of
the property for the purposes for which the property is currently being used),
assuming the timely discharge of all obligations owing under or related to the
tangible personal property and the leased property. No representation is made
under this _Section 4.19_ with respect to any intellectual property or
intellectual property rights, which are the subject of _Section 4.20_.

 



 

(f) None of the Non-Core Land is material to the business or operations of MTR
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.20 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.20(a) of the MTR Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all MTR Registered IP. To the knowledge of MTR, no MTR
Registered IP is involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and no such action is or has
been threatened with respect to any of the MTR Registered IP. All MTR
Registered IP is solely and exclusively owned by MTR or one of its
Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, and neither MTR nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim challenging the validity
or enforceability of any MTR Registered IP that remains pending or unresolved.

 



 

(b) MTR and each of its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable steps
to maintain the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets of MTR and its
Subsidiaries, including taking commercially reasonable steps to safeguard any
such information that is accessible through computer systems or networks.

 



 

(c) To the knowledge of MTR, the business of MTR and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted does not infringe or misappropriate, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, any
effect on any Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person. Neither MTR
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim asserting
that any such infringement or misappropriation is occurring or has occurred,
which notice or claim remains pending or unresolved and that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, any effect on any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person. Neither MTR nor any of its
Subsidiaries has issued any notice or claim since January 1, 2010 that a third
Person is misappropriating or infringing any Owned MTR Intellectual Property
and no Owned MTR Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding order,
judgment, decree or stipulation restricting or limiting in any use or
licensing thereof by MTR or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) MTR or its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right, title and
interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce) the Owned MTR
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens, and have not granted any
license, covenant, release, immunity or other right with respect to any Owned
MTR Intellectual Property to any Person other than non-exclusive licenses
granted in the ordinary course of business in connection with marketing and
promotional activities. All of the MTR Intellectual Property that is necessary
to the business or operations of MTR and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and that is not Owned MTR Intellectual Property (the " _Licensed MTR
Intellectual Property_ ") is duly and validly licensed to MTR or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid and enforceable contract. For avoidance of
doubt, the preceding sentence does not constitute a representation or warranty
with respect to non-infringement of Patents of any third Person, which is
addressed separately in _Section 4.20(c)_. Following the Closing, MTR as the
surviving corporation will own or have, and will be permitted to exercise, the
same rights that MTR and its Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the Closing
with respect to Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights (other
than off-the-shelf computer programs) without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
MTR or its Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay had this
Agreement not been entered into and the transactions not occurred.

 



 

(e) To the knowledge of MTR, MTR and each Subsidiary has (i) complied in all
respects with its respective privacy policies and all applicable Laws relating
to privacy and data security, including with respect to the collection,
storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure, and use of Personal Information;
and (ii) implemented and maintained a data security plan which maintains
effective and commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss, damage, and
unauthorized access, use, modification, or other misuse. To the knowledge of
MTR, there has been no loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use,
modification, or breach of security of Personal Information maintained by or
on behalf of by MTR or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of MTR, since
January 1, 2009, no Person (including any Governmental Entity) has made any
claim or commenced any action with respect to loss, damage, or unauthorized
access, use, modification, or breach of security of Personal Information
maintained by or on behalf of any of MTR or its Subsidiaries. None of the
execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Mergers or other transactions contemplated herein will or reasonably would
be expected to result in any violation of any privacy policy of MTR and its
Subsidiaries or any applicable Law pertaining to privacy, data security, or
Personal Information.

 



 

Section 4.21 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for directors and employment-
related MTR Material Contracts identified in Section 4.17 of the MTR
Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, no executive officer or director of
MTR is a party to any MTR Material Contract with or binding upon MTR or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or has any
interest in any property owned by MTR or any of its Subsidiaries or has
engaged in any transaction with any of the foregoing within the last twelve
(12) months.

 



 

Section 4.22 _State Takeover Statutes_. None of the requirements or
restrictions of any Takeover Laws enacted in any state in the United States
applies to this Agreement or to any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Mergers.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.23 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither MTR nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, whether or not required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of MTR and its Subsidiaries, except

prior to the date of this Agreement or (d) incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since January 1, 2013, neither
MTR nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any off-balance sheet
transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations),
and other relationships with other Persons, that may have a current or future
effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant
components of revenues or expenses of MTR and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.24 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2013
through the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, the businesses of MTR and its Subsidiaries have
been conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, and there has not been any event, development or state of
circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, has had a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.25 _Full Disclosure_. No representation or warranty by the MTR
Entities in this Agreement and no statement contained in the MTR Disclosure
Letter delivered by MTR prior to the execution of this Agreement or any
certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact,
or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

accelerate any rights or benefits or take any action to fund or in any other
way secure the payment of compensation or benefits under any MTR Plan or (E)
make any Person (after the date of this Agreement) a beneficiary of any
retention or severance plan under which such Person is not as of the date of
this Agreement a beneficiary which would entitle such Person to vesting,
acceleration or any other right as a consequence of consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(xvi) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of its
material properties or assets, including any transfer that would constitute
the formation of a "real estate investment trust" or any other corporate
structure that creates an "opco" and "propco" structure, other than
dispositions that in the aggregate do not exceed One Hundred Thousand

 



      
 

 



 

Dollars ($100,000.00); _provided_ , _however_ , that dispositions pursuant to
_Section 5.22_ shall not be counted toward such threshold; or

 



 

(xvii) agree to take any of the actions described in _Sections 5.2(b)(i)_
through _5.2(b)(xvi)_.

Agreement shall give any of the MTR Entities, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct MTRs or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and MTR shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4_ , from and after the date of
this Agreement, MTR agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
and that it shall not authorize or permit its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any investment
banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor retained by MTR or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or
discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted to have
discussions) concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information or data relating to MTR or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the MTR Board permitted under _Section 5.4(b)_ or
(c) or _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.4(a)_. MTR agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and cause its Representatives to cease and cause to be terminated,
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. MTR agrees that
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of MTRs Subsidiaries or
any Representative of MTR or any MTR Subsidiary will be a breach of this
_Section 5.4(a)_ by MTR. MTR agrees that in the event it releases any Person
from, or amends or waives any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill,"
non-solicitation or similar agreement to which MTR is or becomes a party or
under which MTR has or acquires any rights, it shall release the Company and
Subsidiaries and Representatives of Company from, and/or shall waive, all such
parallel or analogous provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. MTR also
will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement all confidential information heretofore furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of MTR.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.4(a)_ , at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the MTR Stockholder
Approval, MTR may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.4(a)_ and that the
MTR Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and subject to complying with
_Section 5.4(d)_ , (i) furnish information with respect to MTR and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive to such
Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such
changes specifically necessary in order for MTR to be able to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that MTR shall
provide or make available to the Company any material non-public information
concerning MTR or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives which was not
previously provided or made available to the Company; and (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that the MTR Board or any
committee thereof may take the actions described in subsections (i) and (ii)
above only if the MTR Board or any committee thereof determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4(c)_ , until the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, neither the MTR Board nor
any committee thereof shall: (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw, modify or amend
or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in any manner adverse to the
Company or Merger Sub, its recommendation of this Agreement or the MTR Merger
(the " _MTR Board Recommendation_ "), (B) fail to make a statement in
opposition and recommend to MTRs stockholders rejection of a tender or
exchange offer for MTRs securities initiated by a third party pursuant to
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act within ten Business Days after
such tender or exchange offer shall have been announced or commenced by such
third party, or (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(C),
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow MTR or any MTR Subsidiary to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.4(b)_ ) (any of the
foregoing, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the MTR
Stockholder Approval, the MTR Board may:

 



 

(I) in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
was made after the date hereof, that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.4_ , and that the MTR Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes
a Superior Proposal (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the MTR Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, the failure
to make such Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, or (y) cause MTR to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and (only if MTR shall) concurrently with
such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement if the MTR Board has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, the failure to effect
such termination would reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that MTR shall not be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless, prior to or simultaneously with such
termination, MTR pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the MTR
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the MTR Board shall not be entitled to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in respect of any such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ in respect of any such Superior Proposal, and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless:

 



 

(II) MTR has provided to the Company four Business Days prior written notice
that it intends to take a such action (a " _Notice of Designated Superior
Proposal_ "), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal) that is the basis of the proposed action by the
MTR Board (a " _Designated Superior Proposal_ ") and attach the most current
form or draft of any written agreement providing for the transaction
contemplated by such Designated Superior Proposal and all other contemplated
transaction documents (including any agreements with any stockholders,
directors or employees) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Designated Superior Proposal, and a new four Business
Day period); and

 



 

(III) at the end of such four Business Day period, such Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn and the MTR Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed by
the Company in a binding written offer in response to a Notice of Designated
Superior Proposal which is capable of being accepted by MTR).

 



 

(d) MTR promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) shall advise the
Company orally and in writing of (i) any written Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
any written request for non-public information relating to MTR or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any written inquiry or request
for discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including in
each case the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request and attach a copy of any such written Acquisition Proposal,
or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to MTR, MTR shall summarize
in writing the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including
the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal. MTR shall keep
the Company reasonably and promptly informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including any material change or proposed material change
to the terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal. MTR shall provide the
Company with prior notice of any meeting of the

 



      
 

 



 

MTR Board or any committee thereof at which the MTR Board or any committee
thereof is expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry
or to consider providing information to any person or group in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry.

 



 

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent MTR or the MTR Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection
with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or (ii)
from making any required disclosure to MTRs stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the MTR Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to
breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of both clause (i) and clause (ii), any such disclosure,
other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, may still be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.4(c)_
unless the MTR Board expressly publicly reaffirms the MTR Board Recommendation
in such disclosure.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement; MTR
Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within forty-five
(45) days, following the date of this Agreement, MTR shall, with the
assistance of the Company, cause Parent to prepare the Registration Statement
(in which the Proxy Statement will be included) and file the Registration
Statement with the SEC. MTR Entities and the Company will cooperate with each
other in the preparation of the Registration Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Member Representative
will furnish to Parent in writing the information relating to it required by
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be
set forth in the Registration Statement. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Registration Statement
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company, and each MTR
Entity will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Registration Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect prior to the MTR Stockholders Meeting.
Parent and MTR shall cause the Registration Statement, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case,
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and MTR shall
give good faith and reasonable consideration to any comments made by the
Company or its counsel. MTR shall promptly notify and provide to the Company
and its counsel any comments MTR or its counsel receives from the SEC with
respect to the Registration Statement and any request by the SEC for any
amendment to the Registration Statement or for additional information.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than
forty (40) days following the effective time of the Registration Statement
(the " _SEC Effectiveness Date_ "), MTR, acting through the MTR Board, shall
(i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of

 



      
 

 



 

obtaining the MTR Stockholder Approval (the " _MTR Stockholders Meeting_ ")
and (ii) except to the extent that the MTR Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_ , include in
the Proxy Statement a statement to the effect that the MTR Board (A) has
unanimously determined that the MTR Merger and this Agreement are advisable
and (B) unanimously recommends that the MTRs stockholders vote to adopt this
Agreement at the MTR Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
MTR shall be permitted to delay, postpone or cancel the MTR Stockholders
Meeting (but not beyond the Termination Date) if in the good faith judgment of
the MTR Board or any committee thereof (after consultation with its legal
counsel) the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to breach the MTR
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and Representatives to, afford to MTR reasonable access during
normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its officers, key
management employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and
records, and shall promptly furnish MTR with all financial, operating and
other data and information as MTR shall reasonably request in writing (it
being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit MTR or its
officers, employees or representatives to conduct any environmental testing or
sampling or other invasive testing). The Company shall furnish to MTR and its
Representatives such available financial and operating data, including any
Company Unaudited Financial Statements, as MTR may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any
agreement with any third party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or (iii) otherwise
violate any applicable Law, including Gaming Laws.

 



 

(b) MTR and each of its Subsidiaries will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to MTR, its Subsidiaries
and/or their respective Representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any and all information or documents
furnished in accordance with the confidentiality letter agreement, dated
October 22, 2012, as amended January 10, 2013, between MTR and Eldorado
Resorts, LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, MTR shall, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and
Representatives to, afford to the Company reasonable access during normal
business hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its officers, key
management employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and
records,

 



      
 

 



 

and shall promptly furnish the Company with all financial, operating and other
data and information as the Company shall reasonably request in writing (it
being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit the Company or its
officers, employees or representatives to conduct any environmental testing or
sampling or other invasive testing). MTR shall furnish to the Company and its
Representatives such available financial and operating data as the Company may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of MTR or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by the employees of MTR or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.
Neither MTR nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach
any agreement with any third party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize
the attorney-client or other privilege held by MTR or (iii) otherwise violate
any applicable Law, including Gaming Laws.

 



 

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries will hold and treat and will
cause its Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and
information concerning MTR and its Subsidiaries furnished to the Company, its
Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any and all information
or documents furnished in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law and under any applicable
Gaming Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
the earliest practicable date, including: (i) causing the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Mergers and the taking of such actions as are necessary to
obtain any requisite expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act; (ii) taking the steps necessary or desirable to

that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_
, each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly

pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the Company and MTR shall

 



       
 

 



 

pay all of its own filing fees and other charges for the filings required
under the HSR Act with respect to it and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, 50% of any filing fee or other
charges required under the HSR Act with respect to MTR and its Subsidiaries
will be included in the MTR Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_
, MTR Entities, and the Company agree to, and agree to cause their Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members,
principals and stockholders to, prepare and submit to the Gaming Authorities
all applications and supporting documents necessary to obtain all required
Gaming Approvals as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than
forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this Agreement, other than with
respect to the Parent Directors, for whom such applications and supporting
documents shall be submitted no later than ninety (90) calendar days from the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to a Request for
Additional Information or Documentary Material under the HSR Act or requests
for supporting, supplemental, or additional documentation from any Gaming
Authorities, then such party shall in good faith make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, a
response which is, at a minimum, in substantial compliance with such request.

 



 

(e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or
clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

by any party under any Antitrust Law or applicable Gaming Law and liaising
with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before the relevant
Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all communications with such
Governmental Entities. In particular, to the extent permitted by Law or
Governmental Entity, no party will make any written communication with any
Governmental Entity in relation to the transactions contemplated hereunder
without first providing the other party with a copy of such communication in
draft form and giving such other party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its
content before it is filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and such
first party shall consider all reasonable comments timely made by the other
party in this respect; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
required to provide the other party with any written communications with any
Governmental Entity (or related materials) if such party reasonably determines
that the disclosure of such written communications with any Governmental
Entity (or related materials) would be materially prejudicial to such partys
business;

 



 

(ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications (and, unless
precluded by Law, providing copies of any such communications that are in
writing) from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law or
Governmental Entity that each of the parties is entitled to attend any
meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless a party has a
reasonable basis to object to the presence of the other party at any such
meetings or appearances;

 



 

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in

including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and obtain
all Permits and all other approvals and any other consents required to be
obtained in order for the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided if any change of control fee assessed by the PGCB
is materially higher than such fees historically assessed by the PGCB in
connection with transactions of this type, then no party hereto shall be
obligated to pay such fee for as long as the amount of such fee is being
appealed in good faith.

 



 

(g) No actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially, competitively and/or personal
sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other
party on an outside counsel-only basis, provided that the parties shall
cooperate to enable appropriate communications to be made available to the
other party with respect to such commercially or competitively sensitive
information redacted if necessary.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Compensation and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall develop (and shall cause the Company and MTR to work together
to develop) common employee compensation and benefit programs as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, recognizing that a period of time
may be necessary for the transition of existing employee benefit programs.

 



 

(b) If mutually agreed by MTR and the Company, each of MTR and/or the Company,
as necessary, shall one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective Time, adopt
resolutions

 



      
 

 



 

terminating any MTR Plans or Company Plans intended to qualify as a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company and MTR become a
members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code), which MTR and the Company have determined should be
terminated prior to the Effective Time. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the party that is
not terminating such plan, and the other party shall provide evidence that
such resolutions have been adopted by MTR, the Company and/or their the
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

construed to establish, amend, or modify any employee benefit plan, program,

between Parent and the applicable MTR Employee or as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, Parent will cause its Subsidiaries to comply with, in

or between MTR or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or
employee of that company, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective
Time under any equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or
agreements of MTR or its Subsidiaries and (iii) all obligations in effect as
of the Effective Time pursuant to outstanding restoration or equity-based
plans, programs or agreements, and all vested and accrued benefits under any
employee benefit, employment compensation, deferred compensation, or similar
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements of MTR or its Subsidiaries. This
_Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement is
intended to (A) confer upon any current or former employee or other service
provider of MTR or its Subsidiaries any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, MTRs Subsidiaries (if applicable) or
any Subsidiary thereof (if applicable)), (B) constitute or create an

Company Employee, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to take any
such action after such 90-day period without complying with all provisions of
the WARN Act, or any similar provision of applicable foreign Law.

this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and MTR and their respective Boards of Directors
shall take such commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary to render
such Law inapplicable to all of the foregoing or to ensure that the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and MTR shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter
of such communication could be material to the Company or the MTR Entities,
(b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set
forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions
being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.10_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice; _provided further_ , that failure to give prompt
notice pursuant to clause (c) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to
the Mergers set forth in _Article VI_ except to the extent that the underlying
fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a
failure. The parties agree and acknowledge that, except with respect to clause
(c) of the first sentence of this _Section 5.10_ , the Companys compliance or
failure of compliance with this _Section 5.10_ shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in _Section
6.3(b)_ shall has been satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause each of MTR and the Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director, manager or
employee of MTR and its Subsidiaries and each present (as of the Effective
Time) and former officer, director, manager or employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Member Representative and the Stockholders Representative
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as applicable against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an
officer, director, manager, employee, fiduciary or agent of MTR, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring
at or

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
and applicable MTRs certificate of incorporation, MTRs bylaws, the Company
Charter and Company Operating Agreement each as at the date hereof
(collectively, the " _Constituent Documents_ "). In the event of any such
Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or MTR or the
Company, as applicable, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
and the applicable Constituent Documents, within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by Parent or MTR or the Company, as applicable, from the Indemnified
Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an unsecured undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, (B)
none of Parent, MTR or the Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C)
MTR and the Company, as applicable, shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter. Parent and MTR, or the Company, as applicable, shall be jointly and
severally liable for the obligation to provide indemnification to the
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent, MTR and the Company
agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of MTR, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement (or form thereof) identified
in Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Section 5.11(b) of the
MTR Disclosure Letter, as applicable, and in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time between such Indemnified Party and MTR, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and continue in full
force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
MTR, the Company and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, or cause to be
provided substitute policies or purchase or cause MTR or the Company to
purchase a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in
the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to
such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by MTR or the Company prior to
the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. All such policies, including any substitute
policies, shall be issued by carriers rated A, XII or higher by A.M. Best
Company. At

 



      
 

 



 

either MTRs or the Companys option, each may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid, non-revocable and non-cancellable tail
policy on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
its and their respective Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby. If such prepaid tail policy has been obtained by MTR or
the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by MTR or the Company, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall
survive the consummation of the Mergers and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Company or Parent or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.11_.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Public Announcements_. Each MTR Entity, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. MTR
and the Company agree that the press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of MTR and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the MTR Entities and the Company may make
public statements in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences so long as such statements are
substantially consistent with press releases, public disclosures or public
statements previously issued or made by MTR or the Company, as applicable.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Obligations of Merger Subs and Parent_. MTR shall take all
action necessary to cause the MTR Entities to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.14 _Consent Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) MTR shall promptly at a time reasonably requested by the Company,
commence, or cause its Subsidiaries to promptly commence, one or more consent
solicitations (each, a " _MTR Consent Solicitation_ "), with respect to
certain amendments and waivers to the indenture (the " _MTR Senior Indenture_
") dated as of August 1, 2011 among MTR, those designated Subsidiaries
identified therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Trustee and
Collateral Agent governing MTRs 11.5% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due
August 1, 2019 (the " _MTR Notes_ ") on terms and conditions as may be agreed
upon between the Company and MTR, and such other customary terms and
conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and MTR, and the
Company shall assist MTR in connection therewith. If the Company requests that
MTR proceed with any MTR Consent Solicitation, MTR shall irrevocably take all
corporate actions necessary for the MTR Consent Solicitation. Promptly
following the expiration date of the MTR Consent Solicitation, assuming the
requisite consents are received with respect to the MTR Notes, MTR and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall execute a supplement to the MTR Senior
Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of the MTR Senior Indenture as
reasonably requested by the Company and as set forth in the MTR Consent
Solicitation documents sent to holders of the MTR Notes (which amendment may
include amendments and waivers to certain covenants contained in the MTR Notes
or the MTR Senior Indenture which can be eliminated upon the favorable vote of
the holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof), which supplemental
indenture shall become operative immediately upon the Effective Time, and
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under the MTR Senior
Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
MTR in connection with any MTR Consent Solicitation. MTR hereby covenants and
agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) when due and payable pursuant
to the terms of any MTR Consent Solicitation immediately available funds for
the prompt and full payment at or prior to the Effective Time of any consent
solicitation fees payable to the holders of the MTR Notes for all consents
properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the
terms of such MTR Consent Solicitation.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, MTR, at its own expense, shall
prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with any MTR
Consent Solicitation, including the consent solicitation statement, related
letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _MTR
Consent Solicitation Statement_ "). MTR and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries, agents and representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Consent Solicitation
Statement for each MTR Consent Solicitation. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
respective agents and representatives (including accountants, attorneys and
other advisors) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide MTR with such
financial and other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, undertake reasonable efforts to obtain customary accountants
comfort letters, if applicable, legal opinions, and other documentation and
items relating to the MTR Consent Solicitation and execute such documents and
take such other actions, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by MTR
to carry out the MTR Consent Solicitation as contemplated hereunder. Each MTR
Consent Solicitation Statement (including all amendments or supplements
thereto) and all

 



      
 

 



 

mailings to the holders of the MTR Notes in connection with such MTR Consent
Solicitation shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and MTR and shall be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to
each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of any MTR Consent
Solicitation any information in the MTR Consent Solicitation Statement should
be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or MTR, on
the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the MTR
Consent Solicitation Statement, so that the MTR Consent Solicitation Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of MTR to the holders of the
Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.14_ , MTR
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if
applicable, and any other Laws applicable in connection with any MTR Consent
Solicitation. In connection with any MTR Consent Solicitation, MTR may select
one or more solicitation agents or, if applicable, dealer managers,
information agents, and other agents to provide assistance in connection
therewith and MTR shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into
customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected and
on terms and conditions acceptable to MTR.

 



 

(c) If none of the MTR Consent Solicitations undertaken pursuant to _Section
5.14_ is successful (or if MTR and the Company agree that MTR not proceed with
any MTR Consent Solicitation pursuant to _Section 5.14_ ), then MTR shall, in
accordance with the terms of the MTR Senior Indenture, (i) no later than
thirty (30) days, but no earlier than sixty (60) days, prior to the Effective
Time, mail a notice to the trustee under the MTR Senior Indenture and each
holder of the MTR Notes offering to repurchase MTR Notes pursuant to the
change of control provisions of the MTR Senior Indenture and (ii) take any
other actions reasonably requested by the Company to otherwise comply with the
change of control provisions of the Indenture and to facilitate the
satisfaction and discharge of any MTR Notes tendered as part of the change of
control offer to repurchase pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the MTR Senior Indenture and the other provisions of the MTR
Senior Indenture applicable thereto. Such change of control offer shall be
made conditioned upon the closing of the Mergers, and the closing of the
change of control offer shall occur, if at all, on the same day as the Closing
Date, or if requested by MTR on such later date, and such change in control
offer otherwise shall comply with the terms of the MTR Senior Indenture. The
redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the MTR Notes pursuant to the
preceding sentences are referred to collectively as the " _Discharge_ " of the
MTR Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by MTR in connection with the
Discharge of the MTR Notes.

 



 

(d) MTR shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (other than any direct
indemnification of any solicitation agent or dealer manager, which shall be
indemnified under the applicable solicitation agent or dealer manager
agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that MTR shall indemnify the Company and
its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities incurred by them in
connection with any solicitation agent or dealer manager agreement) for any
liabilities incurred by any of them in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any action taken by them pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to any Consent Solicitation; _provided_ , _however_ , that MTR shall
not have any obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any such party
or person to the extent it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such damages suffered or incurred are attributable to
information provided by the Company that contained a material misstatement or
omission.

 



 

(e) MTR shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set forth in
clauses (a) through (c) of this _Section 5.14_ if MTR shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations, regardless of the
actual outcome of any Consent Solicitation.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Further Assurances Regarding Existing Credit Agreement_. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the
Companys sole cost and expense, any necessary amendments, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and MTR, to the Companys
senior secured revolving credit facility dated as of June 1, 2011 with Bank of
America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other banks or financial
institutions identified as lenders therein (such credit facility, as amended
from time to time, will be referred to collectively as the " _Existing Credit
Agreement_ "), so that no Default or Event of Default (each as defined
therein) will exist (or otherwise give the lenders thereunder any right to
accelerate payment of the loans thereunder pursuant to Section 8.02(b)
thereunder) after giving effect to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that any amendment or waiver of
any other provision of the Existing Credit Agreement shall require the prior
written consent of MTR.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Tamarack Crossing, LLC_. Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, at its own expense, dispose of, or sell or
assign to a third party, any and all interests, directly or indirectly, in
Tamarack Crossing, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (" _Tamarack_ ").
Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 5.1(b)_ , the Company may
distribute the proceeds from the disposition of the interests in Tamarack to
its members.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Non-Compete_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Merger
Members, the officers and certain senior managers (as mutually agreed upon by
the Company and MTR, the " _Designated Officer_ "), shall enter into non-
competition agreements with Parent (each a " _Non-Compete Agreement_ ") that
will become effective as of the Effective Time and that will include the
following terms:

 



 

(a) if such Merger Member beneficially owns less than 5% of the total
outstanding Parent Common Stock at any time (calculated on a fully diluted
basis), such Merger Member shall not be restricted under the terms of the Non-
Compete Agreement (except, if applicable, any remaining tail period described
in _clause (c)_ below);

 



 

(b) if such Merger Member beneficially owns 5% or more of the total
outstanding Parent Common Stock at any time (calculated on a fully diluted
basis), such Merger Member may pursue corporate opportunities subject a right
of first offer in favor of Parent;

 



 

(c) if such Merger Member beneficially owns 15% or more of the total
outstanding Parent Common Stock at any time (calculated on a fully diluted
basis), such Merger Members activities will be subject to customary non-
competition restrictions in favor of Parent

 



      
 

 



 

until the first anniversary of the later of (i) such Merger Members
separation of service from Parent and/or its Subsidiaries and (ii) such Merger
Member ceasing to beneficially own 15% or more of the total outstanding Parent
Common Stock at any time (calculated on a fully diluted basis);

 



 

(d) the restrictions described in _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ above shall not
apply with respect to any activities related to (i) Michael Pegram or his
Affiliates (so long as such activities are consistent with passive investment
activities) and (ii) Tamarack; and

 



 

(e) The Designated Officers shall be subject to Non-Compete Agreements (which
may be part of any such Designated Officers employment agreement) which shall
include a "right of first offer" and "non-competition restrictions" similar to
those contemplated by _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ above until such persons
separation of service from Parent and/or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Further Assurances Regarding MTR Credit Agreement_. MTR shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at MTRs sole cost and
expense, any necessary amendments, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to MTR and the Company, to the MTR Credit Agreement, so that no
Default or Event of Default (each as defined therein) will exist (or otherwise
give the lenders thereunder any right to accelerate payment of the loans
thereunder pursuant to Section 8.1(j) thereunder) after giving effect to the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that any amendment or waiver of any other provision of the MTR Credit
Agreement shall require the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Mergers to be approved for listing on Nasdaq,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and
MTR agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Company
Insiders and MTR Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Mergers,
both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company
Insiders and MTR Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in
connection with the conversion of shares of MTR Common Stock, MTR Stock
Options, MTR Restricted Shares, MTR RSUs, and Company Membership Interests
into Parent Common Stock, Parent options, restricted shares and units, as the
case may be, in the Mergers, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this _Section 5.20_. Assuming the Company and MTR
deliver to Parent in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time
accurate information regarding those officers and directors of the Company and
MTR who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (respectively, the " _Company Insiders_ " and the " _MTR
Insiders_ "), the number of shares of MTR Common Stock, MTR Stock Options, MTR
Restricted Shares, MTR RSUs, and Company Membership Interests be held by each
such Company Insider or MTR Insider expected to be exchanged in the Mergers,
Parent Board, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time,
adopt a resolution providing in substance that the receipt

 



       
 

 



 

by the Company Insiders and MTR Insiders of Parent Common Stock, Parent
options, and Parent restricted stock units, deferred stock units and phantom
units, in exchange for MTR Common Stock, MTR Stock Options, MTR Restricted
Shares, MTR RSUs, and Company Membership Interests, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are approved by Parent Board
or by such committee thereof, and are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Silver Legacy_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in the event that
any "buy-sell" procedure is initiated with respect to SLJV in accordance with
SLJVs operating agreement, ELLC shall be entitled to exercise all of its
rights under such operating agreement in connection with such "buy-sell"
procedure and otherwise participate in such "buy-sell" procedure in accordance
with the terms of such operating agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.21(a)_ , on or prior to the Closing Date, HCM and
REI shall have transferred their respective interests in ELLC to Eldorado
Resorts, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company, so that, as of the Closing Date, ELLC will be a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.22 _MTR Non-Operating Real Estate_. Prior to the Closing Date, MTR
may, from time to time, sell or dispose of any Non-Core Land, as such term is
defined in (a) Section 1.01 of the MTR Senior Indenture and (b) Section 1.1 of
the MTR Credit Agreement, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, in
its sole discretion.

 



 

Section 5.23 _No-Shop_. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , except as permitted by _Section
5.21(a)_ , the Company will not, nor will it cause or permit any of their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or
encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, or
provide any nonpublic information to, any Person (other than MTR and its
Representatives) relating to any transaction involving the sale of the
Business or any material portion of the property or assets of the Company,
SLJV or their respective Subsidiaries or any of the membership interests or
other equity interests of the Company, SLJV or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, or similar
transaction involving the Company, SLJV or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, the Company will
not, directly or indirectly, enter into or authorize, or permit any
Representatives of Company, SLJV, any of their respective Subsidiaries or of
any of the Companys members to enter into, any agreement or agreement in
principle with any third Person for the acquisition of the Company, SLJV, any
of their respective Subsidiaries, or any material portion of the respective
assets or properties of the Company, SLJV or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or, in the case of the Companys members, any of the membership
interests or other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(a " _Third-Party Transaction_ "). The Company will inform MTR in writing by
facsimile within twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt by any of the
Company or any of its Representatives of any unsolicited inquiry, proposal,
offer or bid (including the terms thereof and the identity of the Person
making such inquiry, proposal, offer or bid) in respect of any Third-Party
Transaction. MTR acknowledges that the mere receipt by the Company of an
unsolicited inquiry or proposal regarding a Third-Party Transaction will not

 



      
 

 



 

constitute a breach of the Company obligations under this _Section 5.23_ ,
but only if the Company notifies MTR of such unsolicited inquiry or proposal
as required by this _Section 5.23_.

 



 

Section 5.24 _Tax Matters_. During the period up to the Closing, the Company
and MTR shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, timely file all
Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity, timely
pay all Taxes due and payable, accrue a reserve in the books and records and
financial statements of any such entity for all Taxes payable but not yet due,
and promptly notify the other of any actions pending against or with respect
to it or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax. After the Closing,
each party to this Agreement shall cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, with each others agents, including accountants and
legal counsel, in connection with Tax matters relating to the Company, MTR,
Parent, and any of their Subsidiaries, including the preparation and filing of
any Tax Returns, examination of Tax Returns, and any administrative or
judicial proceedings in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed.
The parties hereto intend that the Mergers, taken together, be treated as a
transaction qualifying as an exchange under Section 351 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to
qualify as part of an exchange under Section 351 of the Code, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could prevent the Mergers from qualifying as an exchange under Section 351 of
the Code. The Company and MTR shall cooperate and provide any certifications
or representations reasonably required by counsel for the Company and counsel
for MTR, respectively, in providing the opinions described in _Sections
6.2(h)_ and _6.3(j)_ hereof. Following the Effective Time, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Mergers from qualifying as an
exchange under Section 351 of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.25 _Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement_. Not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (or if such date is within ten (10) Business
Days of the Termination Date, then as soon as reasonably practicable on or
prior to the Closing Date), MTR shall prepare and deliver to the Company for
its review a report (the " _Preliminary Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement_ ")
substantially in the form attached hereto as, and in accordance with the
sample, together the policies and procedures and methodologies (if any) set
forth on, _Exhibit C_ setting forth (i) a statement of an estimate of Adjusted
MTR EBITDA as of the Report Date (the " _Closing Condition Adjusted MTR
EBITDA_ "), and (ii) detailed supporting calculations, documentation and data
setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of its
calculations with respect to the foregoing. The Company shall have a
reasonable opportunity to discuss the Preliminary Adjusted MTR EBITDA
Statement with MTR and review such report and the underlying books and records
of MTR related thereto. If the Company objects to any amount reflected on the
Preliminary Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement, MTR and the Company shall in good
faith attempt to resolve such objection and agree to such amounts prior to the
Closing. The " _Closing Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement_ " shall be (x) the
Preliminary Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement revised to reflect any modifications
agreed to by the Company and MTR and, with respect to any item contained in
the Preliminary Adjusted MTR EBITDA Statement that the parties are unable to
resolve, shall be deemed, solely for purposes of determining the Closing

 **ARTICLE VII**

 

 **TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Mergers
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after the MTR Stockholder Approval has been obtained (with any termination by
MTR also being an effective termination by any other MTR Entity):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of MTR and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either MTR or the Company:

 



 

(i) if the Mergers shall not have been consummated before June 9, 2014 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ if any action of
such party or failure of such party to perform or comply with the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement shall have been the
primary cause of, or resulted primarily in, the failure of the Mergers to be
consummated by the Termination Date and such action or failure to perform
constitutes a breach of this Agreement; _provided further_ , that if as of the
Termination Date, all of the conditions precedent to Closing other than the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied) shall have been satisfied as of the
Termination Date, then either MTR or the Company may unilaterally extend the
Termination Date for 180 days upon written notice to the other by the
Termination Date, in which case the Termination Date shall be deemed for all
purposes to be so extended;

 



 

(ii) if the Company or any MTR Entity receives a definitive oral or written

Authority that a MTR Entity or the Company will not be granted any Gaming
Approval by such Gaming Authority that is required in order for the condition
set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ if any action of such party or failure of such party to perform or
comply with the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this
Agreement shall have been the primary cause of, or resulted primarily in, any
such Gaming Authoritys refusal to grant any such Gaming Approval;

 



 

(iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
shall have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to contest, appeal and remove such judgment, order, injunction, rule
or decree, ruling or other action in accordance with _Section 5.7_ ;

 



 

(iv) if the MTR Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the MTR
Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement

 



      
 

 



 

thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party will not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ if the failure to obtain the
MTR Stockholder Approval results from a failure on the part of such party to
perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time; or

 



 

(v) if the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ fails to occur.

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if any MTR Entity shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ and (B) cannot be cured by
the Termination Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall have given MTR
written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination
(or if such breach or failure to perform occurs within thirty (30) days of the
Termination Date, delivered within seven (7) days of such breach or of the
date such performance was due), stating the Companys intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ and the basis for such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ if it
is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) if a Triggering Event has occurred at any time prior to the receipt of
the MTR Stockholder Approval;

 



 

(iii) if all the closing conditions contained in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable
of being satisfied) and Parent fails to fund the Exchange Fund at the Closing;
or

 



 

(iv) if the Company Board so determines by the vote of not less than a
majority of its members, at any time during the five business day period
immediately prior to the Closing Date, if the amount (such difference shall be
the " _Excess Regulatory Fee_ ") of the change of control fee that the PGCB
will assess, which is final and nonappealable, in connection with any petition
or application for approval of the change of control of MTR and its
Subsidiaries is materially higher than such fees historically assessed by the
PGCB in connection with transactions of this type; subject, however, to the
following three sentences. If the Company elects to exercise its termination
right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to MTR (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the five-business day period
commencing upon the delivery of such notice). During the five-business day
period commencing with its receipt of such notice, MTR shall have the option
to elect to do both of the following: (A) advance to the Company in cash an
amount equal to the Excess Regulatory Fee, payment of which shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Company as promptly as practicable, and (B) increase the MTR Excess Expense
Amount by an amount equal to the Excess Regulatory Fee. If MTR makes the
election contemplated by the preceding sentence within such five-business day
period, it shall give prompt written notice to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company of such election and make the payment contemplated in clause (A)
above, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(iv)_ and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms (except that the MTR Excess Expense Amount shall
have been so adjusted);

 



 

(d) by MTR:

 



 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.3_ and (B) cannot be cured by
the Termination Date; _provided_ , that MTR shall have given the Company
written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination
(or if such breach or failure to perform occurs within thirty (30) days of the
Termination Date, delivered within seven (7) days of such breach or of the
date such performance was due), stating MTRs intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and the basis for such
termination; _provided further_ , that MTR shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if any MTR
Entity is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) only prior to having obtained the MTR Stockholder Approval, in order to
enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if prior to the receipt
of the MTR Stockholder Approval, (A) the MTR Board has received a Superior
Proposal, (B) MTR has complied with the provisions of _Section 5.4_ , and (C)
prior to or concurrently with such termination, MTR pays the MTR Termination
Fee due under _Section 7.3_.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
(other than pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ ) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of any MTR Entity, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, except that if there has been any material and willful, intentional or
knowing (i) failure of any party to perform its covenants, agreements or
obligations hereunder or (ii) breach by any party of its representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, then such party will be fully liable
for any liabilities or damages suffered by the other parties hereto as a
result of such failure or breach.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.2(a)_ above, in the
event of termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the

Announcements), _Section 7.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 7.3_ (Fees and
Expenses), _Section 8.2_ (Notices), _Section 8.5_ (Entire Agreement), _Section
8.6_ (Parties in Interest), _Section 8.7_ (Governing Law), _Section 8.8_
(Submission to Jurisdiction), _Section 8.9_ (Assignment; Successors), _Section
8.10_ (Enforcement), _Section 8.11_ (Severability), _Section 8.12_ (Waiver of
Jury Trial), and _Section 8.15_ (No Presumption Against Drafting Party) of
this Agreement shall survive the termination hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.7(b)_ , _Section 5.15(e)_ or
this _Section 7.3_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Mergers
are consummated, except that the expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC
filing fees) and the solicitation of the MTR Stockholder Approval shall be
paid by MTR.

 



 

(b) If:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by MTR or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iv)_ and, prior to the MTR Stockholders Meeting, there has been a
Triggering Event;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ ;

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by MTR pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ ;
or

 



 

(iv) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made directly to MTRs
shareholders or otherwise publicly disclosed prior to the taking of the vote
to receive the MTR Stockholder Approval at the MTR Stockholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, (B) this Agreement is thereafter
terminated by either the Company or MTR pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ and
(C) within nine (9) months of the date of such termination of this Agreement,
MTR or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal with such party or its
Affiliates,

 



 

then, in any such case, MTR shall pay the Company a termination fee of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in cash and an amount equal to the Expense
Reimbursement (collectively, the " _MTR Termination Fee_ "), it being
understood that in no event shall MTR be required to pay the MTR Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the MTR Termination Fee shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated
by the Company (A) as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than
two (2) Business Days, after termination of this Agreement by the Company in
the case of a MTR Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Sections 7.3(b)(i)_ or
_(ii)_ , (B) prior to or simultaneously with such termination of this
Agreement by MTR in the case of a MTR Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Sections 7.3(b)(i)_ or _(iii)_ , or (C) prior to or simultaneously with the
entering into or consummation of the applicable Acquisition Proposal in the
case of a MTR Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Sections 7.3(b)(iv)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any payment of the MTR
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(iv)_ above, the amount, if any, of
any payment made by MTR to the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ below
shall be deducted from the amount of the MTR Termination Fee payable to the
Company in such instance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated and the MTR Termination Fee is
payable to the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_ , then, in

 



       
 

 



 

such instances, the Companys right to receive the MTR Termination Fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by the Company and its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against MTR
and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by MTR or the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iv)_ , and prior to such termination there shall not have been a
Triggering Event, then MTR shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event
no later than two (2) Business Days, after the termination of this Agreement
(in the case of a termination by the Company) or prior to or simultaneously
with the termination of this Agreement (in the case of a termination by MTR),
reimburse the Company for all of its fees and expenses actually incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to a
maximum reimbursement of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in cash
(the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ").

 



 

(d) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to _Section 7.3_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for
the amounts set forth in _Section 7.3_ , such party shall pay other party its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to the applicable provisions of this _Section 7.3_ from the date such payment

required to be made.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the MTR Stockholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the MTR Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of MTR without such further
approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the MTR Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval
or adoption by the stockholders of MTR without such further approval or
adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a
duly authorized officer

 



      
 

 



 

on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any
right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power.

Representative_ ") immediately following the Effective Time and authorizes and
empowers each of them to act individually to receive all demands, notices and
other communications on or with respect to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of the Merger Members hereunder as each such Persons
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, and for such Person and in such
Persons name, to (i) receive all demands, notices or other communications
directed to such Person under this Agreement and to take any action (or to
determine to refrain from taking any action) with respect thereto as the
Member Representative may deem appropriate as effectively as such Person could
act for itself (including, without limitation, the defense of any indemnity

controversy), (ii) give all notices, demands and other communications to the
MTR Entities or other Persons for and on behalf of the Company, the Companys

the Member Representative to accomplish or otherwise effect any of the

all instruments and documents of every kind incident to any of the foregoing
duties with the same effect as if such Person had executed and delivered such
related agreements and other instruments and documents personally.
Accordingly, any demands, notices or other communications directed to the

consent or instruction of the Member Representative with respect to matters
contemplated by this _Section 8.17_ (which may be done by either person
constituting the Member Representative, acting individually) shall constitute
a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries and all of the Merger Members and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and each of the Merger
Members, and Parent and the Escrow Agent may rely on each such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Member Representative as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and
each of the Merger Members. The individuals constituting the Member
Representative agree that, at any time that there are three individuals
constituting the Member Representative, the Member Representative shall make
decisions and act in accordance with the approval or direction of a majority
of such individuals. Parent and Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in reliance upon, or in
accordance with, any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Member
Representative.

the exercise of reasonable judgment. Except as expressly set forth herein,
Parent shall indemnify the Member Representative (including each individual
constituting the Member Representative) and hold the Member Representative
(including each individual constituting the Member Representative) harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without fraud, willful
misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Member Representative (or such
individual constituting the Member Representative, as the case may be) and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Member Representatives duties hereunder.

its stockholders, shall irrevocably make, constitute, and appoint a non-
employee member of the MTR Board who will not be serving on the Parent Board
immediately following the Effective Time and will not be an employee of the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time no
later than the Closing Date as their representative (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Stockholders Representative_ ") immediately following the Effective Time
and authorizes and empowers such Person to act to receive all demands, notices
and other communications on or with respect to MTR and its stockholders prior
to the Effective Time as each such Persons true and lawful attorney-in-fact
and agent, and for such Person and in such Persons name, to (i) perform the
obligations set forth in _Section 2.9_ for and on behalf of MTR and its
stockholders prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) take all actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Representative to

other Person reasonably acceptable to Parent who shall agree in writing to
accept such appointment in accordance with the terms hereof. The resignation
of any Stockholders Representative shall not be effective until a successor
Stockholders Representative has been appointed, and has accepted such
appointment in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 8.18(a)_. The
selection of a successor Stockholders Representative appointed in any manner
permitted in this _Section 8.18(a)_ shall be final and binding upon MTR and
its stockholders prior to the Effective Time and written notice of such
selection and appointment shall be provided to Parent promptly.

consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative with respect to
matters contemplated by this _Section 8.18_ shall constitute a decision, act,
consent or instruction of MTR and its stockholders prior to the Effective Time
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon MTR and its stockholders prior
to the Effective Time, and Parent and the Escrow Agent may rely on each such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of MTR and its stockholders
prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from
any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in reliance upon, or in
accordance with, any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the

(4) at least ten (10) days written notice of the Repurchase Date shall be
given to the Beneficial Owner (and the record holder if such Person is not the
Beneficial Owner) of the Repurchase Securities selected to be repurchased
(unless notice is waived in writing by any such holder) provided that the
Repurchase Date may be the date on which written notice is given if the cash
or Corporation Debt Securities necessary to effect the repurchase shall have
been deposited in trust for the benefit of such record holder and subject to
immediate withdrawal upon surrender of the certificates for the Repurchase
Securities to be repurchased;

 



 

(5) from and after the Repurchase Date or such earlier date as mandated by
either the Nevada Revised Statutes, any State law applicable to the
determination that a Beneficial Owner is a Disqualified Holder or applicable
federal law, any and all rights of whatever nature which may be held by the
Beneficial Owners of Repurchase Securities selected for repurchase (including,
without limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on
securities of the same class or series as such Repurchase Securities), shall
cease and terminate and such Beneficial Owners shall thenceforth be entitled
only to receive the cash or Corporation Debt Securities payable upon

 **Section 2**. **2** _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the
stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the
Nevada Revised Statutes ("NRS") or by the Articles of Incorporation of the
corporation (as amended from time to time, the "Articles of Incorporation"),

if there be no chairman of the board and no chief executive officer, by the
president, and shall be called by the secretary upon the written request of at
least a majority of the Board of Directors or at the request of the holders of
not less than one-fourth of all the outstanding shares of the corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting. Such request shall state the purposes of the
proposed meeting. The officers and directors shall fix the time and any place,
either within or outside the State of Nevada, as the place for holding such
meeting.

 



 

 **Section 2.3 **_Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be

stockholder stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of
a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called,

personally or by first class, certified or registered mail, by or at the

under the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a
waiver thereof in notice signed writing or sent by the transmission of an
electronic record signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice,
whether before, at, or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to
the giving of such notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened.

 



 

 **Section 2.6 **_Fixing of Record Date_. In order that the corporation may

other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in
advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than
ten (10) days before the date of any meeting; not more than ten (10) days
after the resolution fixing the record date for any written consent; and not
more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is
fixed, the record date shall be: (a) for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived,
at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held; (b) for determining stockholders entitled to express consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is necessary, the day on which the first written consent is
delivered to the corporation; and (c) for determining stockholders for any
other purpose the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

 **Section 2.7 **_Voting Record_. The officer or agent having charge of the
stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make, at least ten
(10) days before each meeting of the stockholders, a complete record of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof,
arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares
held by each. The record shall be subject to the inspection of any
stockholders for any purpose germane to the meeting during ordinary business
hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at
a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be
specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place
where the meeting is to be held. The record shall also be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. The original stock transfer
books shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the record or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of the
shareholders.

 



 

 **Section 2.8 **_Proxies_. At all meetings of the stockholders, a
stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person, or by proxy executed in
writing by the stockholder or by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.
Any proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at
the time of the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the proxy and not
prohibited by applicable law, a proxy may be revoked at any time before it is
voted, either by written notice filed with the secretary or the acting
secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by the stockholder to the
presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a stockholder who has
filed his or her proxy shall not of itself constitute a revocation of the
proxy. No proxy shall be valid after three years from the date of its
execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. The Board of Directors
shall have the power and authority to prescribe rules and regulations
establishing presumptions as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.

 



 

 **Section 2.9 **_Quorum; Action of Stockholders_. At all meetings of the
stockholders, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person
or by proxy (and in no event less than 33 1/3 percent of the outstanding
shares of the corporations common voting stock), shall constitute a quorum,
and at any meeting at which a quorum is present the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a
greater proportion or number is required by the Nevada Revised Statutes or the
Articles of Incorporation. If a quorum is not present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the outstanding shares represented
at the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time for a period not to
exceed sixty (60) days at any one adjournment. Except as hereafter provided,
when a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any
such

      
 

 



 

adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original
meeting. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum present.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** _Voting of Shares_. Each outstanding share of record,
regardless of class, is entitled to one vote, and each fractional share is
entitled to a corresponding fractional vote, on each matter submitted to a
vote of the stockholders, except to the extent that the voting rights of the
shares of any class or classes are limited or denied by or pursuant to the
Articles of Incorporation as permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes. In the
election of directors each record holder of stock entitled to vote at such
election shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by him or her
for as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose
election he or she has the right to vote. Cumulative voting shall not be
allowed in the election of directors or for any other purpose.

 



 

 **Section 2.11** _Voting of Shares by Certain Holders_. Neither treasury
shares nor shares held by another corporation if a majority of the shares
entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation is
held by the corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in
determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.

 



 

Shares standing in the name of another corporation, whether domestic or
foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of the
other corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of any such provision, as
the Board of Directors of the other corporation may determine. Persons
holding stock in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote the shares so
held. A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the corporation
he or she has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon.

 



 

 **Section 2.12** _Shares Held by Two or More Persons_. If shares or other
securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two or more
persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants
in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two or more persons
have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, voting with
respect to the shares shall, except as hereafter provided, have the following
effect. (a) if only one person votes, his or her act binds all; (b) if two or
more persons vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if two or
more persons vote, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each
faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or any person
voting the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada to appoint an additional person
to act with the persons so voting the shares. The shares shall then be voted
as determined by a majority of such persons and the person appointed by the
court. If a tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for
purposes hereof shall be a majority or even split in interest. The effects of
voting stated in the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be
applicable, however, if the secretary of the corporation is given written
notice of alternate voting provisions and is furnished with a copy of the
instrument or order wherein the alternate voting provisions are stated.

 



 

 **Section 2.13** _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or
permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes to be taken at any meeting of the
stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without
a vote if the action is evidenced by one or more written consents, which may
be signed in counterparts, describing the action taken, signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Any such action by
written consent shall be effective upon the date specified in the consent so
long as written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders are
delivered to the corporation in the manner specified above within sixty (60)
days of the earliest dated consent. Prompt notice of the taking of the
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. A
written consent of the stockholders given in accordance with this section has
the same force and effect as a vote of such stockholders and may be stated as
such in any document. The record date for determining stockholders entitled
to take action without a meeting is set forth in Section 2.6 of this Article
II.

 



 

 **Section 2.14** _Order of Business_. The order of business at the annual
meeting, and so far as practicable at all other meetings of stockholders,

 **Section 2.15** _Voting By Ballot_. Voting on any question or in any
election may be by voice vote unless the presiding officer shall order or any
stockholder shall demand that voting be by ballot, except that the election of
directors shall be by written ballot.

 



 

 **Section 2.16** _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_ _._

 



 

(A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. (1) Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of
business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting
of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting (or
any supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or any committee thereof or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was
a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the notice provided for
in this Section 2.16 is delivered to the secretary of the corporation, who is
entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 2.16.

 



 

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this
Section 2.16, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing
to the secretary of the corporation and any such proposed business other than
the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must
constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a
stockholders notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal
executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on
the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy
(70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting
or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. In no event shall the
public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting
commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice shall set
forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election as a director (i) all information relating to such person that is
required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors
in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and
in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (ii) such persons written consent to
being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director
if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to
bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including
the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that
such business includes a proposal to amend the bylaws of the corporation, the
language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business
at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
(c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any,
on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of
such stockholder, as they appear on the corporations books, and of such
beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the
corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and
such beneficial owner, (iii) whether and the extent to which any hedging or
other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on
behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any
short positions or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made,
the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk of stock
price changes for, or to increase the voting power of, such stockholder or any
such beneficial owner with respect to any share of stock of the corporation,
(iv) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of
the corporation entitled to

      
 

 



 

vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (v) a representation
whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of
a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to
holders of at least the percentage of the corporations outstanding capital
stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or
(b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal
or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.16 shall
be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the
corporation of his, her or its intention to present a proposal or nomination
at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations
promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholders proposal or
nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by
the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation
may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as a director of the corporation.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of
this Section 2.16 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors
to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual
meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation
naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred
(100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 2.16 shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional
directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal
executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on
the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is
first made by the corporation.

 



 

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting. Nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special
meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
corporations notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof or (2) provided that the Board of Directors
has determined, or a stockholder or stockholders have requested pursuant and
subject to Section 2.2 of this Article II, that directors shall be elected at
such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of
record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.16 is delivered
to the secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting
and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 2.16. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of
Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such
position(s) as specified in the corporations notice of meeting, if the
stockholders notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.16 shall
be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In
no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

 



 

(C) _General_. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.16 shall be eligible to be elected at
an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 2.16. Except as otherwise provided
by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to
determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before
the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.16 (including whether the stockholder
or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit,
as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholders nominee or
proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as required by
clause (A)(2)(c)(v) of this Section 2.16) and (b) if any proposed nomination
or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.16, to
declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed
business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.16, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a
qualified

      
 

 



 

representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special
meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or proposed
business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business
shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote
may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.16,
to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must
be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must
be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing
or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or
electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

 



 

(2) For purposes of this Section 2.16, "public announcement" or "was made
public" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones
News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a
document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 2.16. Nothing in this Section 2.16 shall be deemed to
affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or
nominations in the corporations proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules
and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of
any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.

affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a
quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office. Any directorship to be
filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an
election at an annual meeting or at a special meeting of the stockholders
called for that purpose, and a director so chosen shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of the stockholders and thereafter until his or her
successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier
death resignation or removal.

 



 

 **Section 3.4 **_Regular Meetings_. A regular meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw immediately after
and at the same place as the annual meeting of the stockholders, for the
purpose of electing officers and for the transaction of such other business as
may come before the meeting. The

      
 

 



 

Board of Directors may provide by resolution the time and place, either within
or outside Nevada, for the holding of additional regular meetings without
other notice than such resolution.

 



 

 **Section 3.5 **_Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by or at the request of the chairman of the board or
by the president. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings
of the Board of Directors may fix any place as the place, either within or
outside Nevada, for holding any special meeting of the board called by them.

 



 

 **Section 3.6 **_Notice_. Notice of any special meeting of the Board of
Directors, stating the place, day and hour of the meeting, shall be given at
least five (5) days prior to the meeting by written notice mailed by first
class, certified or registered mail, to each director at his or her business
or residence address or by notice given at least two (2) days prior to the
meeting by personal delivery or by telephone, telegraph, telecopier, telex or
other similar device. The method of notice need not be the same to each
director. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given two (2) days
after such notice is deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with
postage thereon prepaid. If personally delivered, notice shall be deemed to
be given when delivered to the director. If notice is given by telegram, such
notice shall be deemed to be delivered when the telegram is delivered to the
telegraph company. When any notice is required to be given to any director of
the corporation under the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes or under
the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or these bylaws, a waiver
thereof in writing signed by the person entitled to such notice, whether
before, at, or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the
giving of such notice. By attending or participating in a regular or special
meeting, a director waives any required notice of such meeting unless the
director, at the beginning of the meeting, objects to the holding of the
meeting or the transacting of business at the meeting. Neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors
need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

 



 

 **Section 3.7 **_Presumption of Assent_. A director who is present at a
meeting of the board or a committee of the board when corporate action is
taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he or she
objects at the beginning of such meeting to the holding of the meeting or the
transacting of business at the meeting; (b) he or she contemporaneously
requests that his or her dissent from the action taken be entered in the
minutes of such meeting; or (c) he or she gives written notice of his or her
dissent to the presiding officer of such meeting before its adjournment or to
the secretary of the corporation immediately after adjournment of such
meeting. Such right of dissent as to a specific action taken in a meeting of
the board or a committee shall not be available to a director who votes in
favor of such action.

 



 

 **Section 3.8 **_Quorum and Voting_. A majority of the number of directors
fixed by Section 3.2 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, and the vote
of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If less than a quorum is
present at a meeting, the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time
to time without further notice other than an announcement at the meeting. No
director may vote or act by proxy at any meeting of directors.

 



 

 **Section 3.9** _Compensation_. By resolution of the Board of Directors,
any director may be paid any one or more of the following: his or her
expenses, if any, of attendance at meetings; a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting; a stated salary as director; or such other compensation as the
corporation and the director may reasonably agree upon. No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor.

 



 

 **Section 3.10 **_Meetings by Telephone_. Unless otherwise provided by the
Articles of Incorporation, one or more members of the Board of Directors or
any committee designated by the board may participate in a meeting of the
board or committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by which all persons participating in the

      
 

 



 

meeting can hear each other at the same time. Such participation shall
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 



 

 **Section 3.11 **_Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or
permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes to be taken at a meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee designated by the board may be taken without a
meeting if the action is evidenced by one or more written consents describing
the action taken, signed by each director or committee member, and delivered
to the secretary for inclusion in the minutes or for filing with the corporate
records. Any such action by written consent shall be effective when all
directors or committee members have signed the consent, unless the consent
specifies a different effective date. Such consent has the same force and
effect as a unanimous vote of the directors or committee members and may be
stated as such in any document.

 



 

 **Section 3.12** _Order of Business_. So far as applicable, the order of
business at each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) Call to order.

 

(b) Roll call  determination of quorum.

 

(c) Proof of due notice of meeting or waiver thereof.

 

(d) Reading and approval of minutes of previous meeting.

 

(e) Unfinished business.

 

(f) New business including, but not limited to:

 **Section 3.13** _Executive and Other Committees_. By one or more
resolutions, the Board of Directors may designate from among its members an
executive committee and one or more other committees, each of which, to the
extent provided in the resolution establishing such committee, shall have and
may exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors, except as
otherwise provided by Nevada Revised Statutes. Neither the designation of any
such committee, the delegation of authority to such committee, nor any action
by such committee pursuant to its authority shall alone constitute compliance
by any member of the Board of Directors, not a member of the committee in
question, with his or her responsibility to act in good faith, in a manner he
or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and
with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use
under similar circumstances.

 



 

 **Section 3.14** _Standard of Care_. A director shall perform his or her
duties as a director, including his or her duties as a member of any committee
of the board upon which he or she may serve, in good faith, in a manner he or
she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and
with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use
under similar circumstances. In performing his or her duties, a director
shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements,
including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared
or presented by persons and groups herein designated; but he or she shall not
be considered to be acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning
the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted. A
person who so performs his or her duties shall not have any liability by
reason of being or having been a director of the corporation. The designated
groups on which a director is entitled to rely are:

 



 

(a) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director
reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

 

(b) counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters which the
director reasonably believes to be within such persons professional or expert
competence; or

 

(c) a committee of the board upon which he or she does not serve, duly
designated in accordance with Section 3.13 of these bylaws, as to matters
within its designated authority, which committee the director reasonably
believes to merit confidence.

      
 

 



 

 **Section 3.15 **_Conflicts of Interest_. No contract or transaction
between the corporation and one or more of its directors, or between the
corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for
that reason or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the board or committee thereof which
authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction or solely
because his, her or their votes are counted for such purpose if:

 



 

(a) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors
or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes,
approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors are less than a quorum;

 

(b) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
authorized, approved, or ratified in good faith by vote of the stockholders;
or

 

(c) the contract or transaction was fair as to the corporation. Common or
interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at
a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes,
approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction.

necessary, who shall be chosen in such manner and hold their offices for such
terms and have such authority and duties as from time to time may be
determined by the Board of Directors. One person may hold more than one

 **Section 4.3 **_Removal_. Any officer or agent may be removed by the Board
of Directors or by the executive committee, if any, whenever in its judgment
the best interests of the corporation will be served thereby, but such removal
shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so
removed. Election or appointment of an officer or agent shall not in itself
create contract rights.

 



 

 **Section 4.4 **_Vacancies_. Any officer may resign at any time, subject to
any rights or obligations under any existing contracts between the officer and
the corporation, by giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the
president or to the Board of Directors. An officers resignation shall take

or if there be no such designation then the vice presidents in order of their
election), shall, at the request of the president, or in the event of his or
her absence, death or inability or refusal to act, perform the duties of the
president and when so acting shall have all the powers of and be subject to
all the restrictions upon the president.

control belonging to the corporation.

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 **Stock**

 



 

 **Section 5.1 **_Issuance of Shares_. The issuance or sale by the
corporation of any shares of its authorized capital stock of any class,
including treasury shares, shall be made only upon authorization by the Board
of Directors, except as otherwise may be provided by statute.

      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.2 **_Certificates_. (a) The shares of stock of the corporation
shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of
the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of
any or all classes or series of such shares shall be uncertificated shares.
Any such resolutions shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate
until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the
adoption of any resolution providing for uncertificated shares, any
certificates for the shares of stock of the corporation shall be in such form
as is consistent with the corporations Articles of Incorporation and
applicable law. Certificates representing shares of stock of the corporation
shall be signed in the name of the corporation by the chairperson or vice
chairperson of the Board of Directors, or the president or a vice-president,
and the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant
secretary, and shall be sealed with the seal of the corporation, or with a
facsimile thereof. Any or all of the signatures on any certificate may also be
a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have
ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the
date of its issue. Each certificate for shares shall be consecutively
numbered or otherwise identified, shall state on the face that the corporation
is organized under the laws of the State of Nevada, the name of the person to
whom issued, the number and class of shares and the designation of the series,
if any, which such certificate represents, and the par value of each share
represented by the certificate or a statement that the shares are without par
value. Each certificate shall be otherwise in such form consistent with law
as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. Restrictions imposed by the
corporation on the transferability of the shares shall be noted or referred to
conspicuously on the certificate. No certificates shall be issued until the
shares represented thereby are fully paid. In addition to the above, all
certificates (or uncertificated shares in lieu of a new certificate)
evidencing shares of the corporations stock or other securities issued by the
corporation shall contain such legend or legends as may from time to time be
required by the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Nevada Gaming Commission
Regulations, or the statutes and regulations of any other gaming jurisdiction
in which the corporation or any of its affiliates has operations, which are
then in effect.

 



 

(b) Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
stock, the corporation shall send, or cause to be sent, to the registered
owner thereof a written notice that shall set forth the name of the
corporation, that the corporation is organized under the laws of the State of
Nevada, the name of the stockholder, the number and class (and the
designations, powers, preferences or other rights, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such powers, preferences or rights of the
series, if any) of the shares represented, and any restrictions on the
transfer or registration of such shares of stock imposed by the corporations
Articles of Incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement among stockholders or
any agreement between stockholders and the corporation.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided by law, the rights and obligations of the
holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the holders
of certificated shares of the same class and series shall be identical.

 



 

 **Section 5.3 **_Consideration for Shares_. Each share of stock, when
issued, shall be fully paid and nonassessable. The shares of the corporation
shall be issued for such consideration expressed in dollars (but not less than
the par value thereof, with respect to shares having a par value) as shall be
fixed from time to time by the board of directors. The consideration for the
issuance of shares may be paid, in whole or in part, in money, in other
property, tangible or intangible, or in labor or services actually performed
for the corporation. The promise of future services shall not constitute
payment or part payment for shares of the corporation, and neither the
promissory note of a subscriber or direct purchaser of shares from the
corporation, nor the unsecured or nonnegotiable promissory note of any other
person shall constitute payment or part payment for shares of the corporation.
The judgment of the Board of Directors as to the value of any property or
services received shall, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, be conclusive
upon all persons. Treasury shares shall be disposed of for such consideration
expressed in dollars as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of
Directors.

 



 

 **Section 5.4 **_Lost Certificates_. The holder of any shares of stock of
the corporation shall promptly notify the Corporation of any loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of the certificates therefor. The corporation may
issue, or cause to be issued, (i) a new certificate or certificates of stock
or (ii) uncertificated shares in place of any certificate or certificates
theretofore issued by it alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed upon
evidence satisfactory to the corporation of the loss, theft or destruction of
the certificate and, in the case of mutilation, the surrender of the mutilated
certificate. The corporation may, in its discretion, require the owner of the
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representatives, to
give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of any such

      
 

 



 

certificate and the issuance of such new certificate, or may refer such owner
to such remedy or remedies as he or she may have under the laws of the State
of Nevada.

 



 

 **Section 5.5 **_Transfer of Shares_. (a) Upon surrender to the corporation
or to a transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate of stock duly
endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or
authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, and cancel the old certificate.
Every such transfer of stock shall be entered on the stock books of the
corporation.

 



 

(b) Upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner
of uncertificated shares, such uncertificated shares shall be cancelled,
issuance of new equivalent uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall
be made to the stockholder entitled thereto and the transaction shall be
recorded upon the books of the corporation. If the corporation has a transfer
agent or registrar acting on its behalf, the signature of any officer or
representative thereof may be in facsimile.

 



 

 **Section 5.6 **_Holders of Record_. The corporation shall be entitled to
treat the record holder of any shares of the corporation as the owner thereof
for all purposes, including all rights deriving from the shares. The
corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or
interest in the shares or rights deriving from the shares on the part of any
other person, including, without limitation, a purchaser, assignee or
transferee of such shares or rights deriving from the shares, unless and until
the purchaser, assignee, transferee or other person becomes the record holder
of the shares, whether or not the corporation shall have either actual or
constructive notice of the interest. Until the purchaser, assignee or
transferee of any of the shares of the corporation has become the record
holder of the shares, he or she shall not be entitled to receive notice of
meetings, examine lists of the stockholders, receive dividends or other sums
payable to stockholders, or own, enjoy and exercise any other property or
rights deriving from the shares of the corporation.

 



 

 **Section 5.7 **_Transfer Agents, Registrars and Paying Agents_. The Board
of Directors may at its discretion appoint one or more transfer agents,
registrars or agents for making payment upon any class of stock, bond,
debenture or other security of the corporation. Such agents and registrars
may be located either within or outside Nevada. They shall have such rights
and duties and shall be entitled to such compensation as may be agreed.

 



 

 **Section 5.8 **_Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of the
corporation of any class shall have any preemptive or preferential right in or
preemptive or preferential right to subscribe to or for or acquire any new or
additional shares, or any subsequent issue of shares, or any unissued or
treasury shares of the corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized, or
any securities convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe to or for or
acquire any such shares, whether now or hereafter authorized.

 



 

 **Section 5.9 **_Restrictions on Transfer_. The corporation shall have the
right, at any time, by entering into an agreement with the holders of its
then-outstanding stock, to restrict or limit the sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance or other disposition of the shares of the
corporation, or any part thereof. Such restrictions may apply to lifetime
transfers as well as to transfers upon the death of a stockholder.
Regulations regarding the formalities and procedures to be followed in seeking
to effect any transfer that is restricted by such an agreement may be set
forth in the agreement or prescribed in these bylaws. With respect to any
such agreement to which it is a party, the corporation, on its part, shall
observe and carry out the terms thereof and shall refuse to recognize any
sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance or other
disposition of any of the shares covered by the agreement unless the same are
in conformity with the terms and conditions of the agreement and with these
bylaws. Following its adoption, a copy of any such agreement shall be filed
in the principal office of the corporation, and notice of the existence of
such agreement shall be displayed conspicuously on the face or back of each
certificate representing shares subject to the terms and conditions of such
agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.10 **_Regulations_. The Board of Directors shall have power and
authority to make such additional rules and regulations as it may deem
expedient concerning the issue, transfer, conversion and registration of
certificated or uncertificated shares of stock of each class and series of the
corporation.

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **Indemnification**

 



 

 **Section 6.1** _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VI, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

 



 

(a) Action - Any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative;

 



 

(b) Derivative Action - Any Action by or in the right of the corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor;

 



 

(c) Third Party Action - Any Action other than a Derivative Action;

 



 

(d) Indemnified Party - Any person who is or was a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any Action by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation any employee
benefit plan of the corporation for which any such person is or was serving as
trustee, plan administrator or other fiduciary.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** _Third Party Actions_. The corporation shall indemnify any
Indemnified Party against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, excise taxes and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her in connection with any Third Party Action if, as
determined pursuant to Section 6.5 below, he or she acted in good faith and in
a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal Action, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

 



 

 **Section 6.3 **_Derivative Actions_. The corporation shall indemnify any
Indemnified Party against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement
of any Derivative Action if, as determined pursuant to Section 6.5 below, he
or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person is or has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or
misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the corporation
unless and only to the extent that the court in which such Action was
brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability and in view of all circumstances of the case, such Indemnified Party
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which
such court deems proper.

 



 

 **Section 4**. _Success on Merits or Otherwise_. If and to the extent that
any Indemnified Party has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any Action referred to in Section 6.2 or 6.3 of this Article VI, or
in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith without the
necessity of any determination that he or she has met the applicable standards
of conduct set forth in Section 6.2 or 6.3 of this Article VI.

 



 

 **Section 6.5** _Determination_. Except as provided in Section 6.4, any
indemnification under Section 6.2 or 6.3 of this Article VI (unless ordered by
a court) shall be made by the corporation only upon a determination that
indemnification of the Indemnified Party is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in
said Section 6.2 or 6.3. Any indemnification under Section 6.4 of this Article
VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only upon a
determination by the corporation of the extent to which the Indemnified Party
has been or would have been successful on the merits or otherwise. Any such
determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote
of a quorum consisting of directors who are not or were not parties to the
subject Action or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable
a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel
(which counsel shall not be the counsel generally employed by the corporation
in connection with its corporate affairs) in a written opinion, or (c) by the
stockholders of the corporation.

      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.6** _Effect of Termination of Action_. The termination of any
Action by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo
contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not of itself create either a presumption
that the indemnified Party did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the corporation, or with respect to any criminal Action, a presumption that
the Indemnified Party had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct
was unlawful. Entry of a judgment by consent as part of a settlement shall not
be deemed a final adjudication of liability for negligence or misconduct in
the performance of duty, nor of any other issue or matter.

 



 

 **Section 6.7 **_Payment in Advance_. Expenses (including attorneys fees)
or some part thereof incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending any Action,
shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
Action if a determination to make such payment is made on behalf of the
corporation as provided in Section 6.5 of this Article VI; provided that no
such payment may be made unless the corporation shall have first received a
written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such
amount unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be
indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.

 



 

 **Section 6.8** _Other Indemnification Rights_. The indemnification
provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Indemnified Party or other person may be entitled under the
Articles of Incorporation, any agreement, bylaw (including without limitation
any other or further Section or provision of this Article VI), vote of the
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, and any procedure
provided for by any of the foregoing, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

 



 

 **Section 6.9 **_Period of Indemnification_. Any indemnification pursuant
to this Article VI shall continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased
to be a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the corporation or,
at the request of the corporation, was serving as and has since ceased to be a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without
limitation, any employee benefit plan of the corporation for which any such
person served as a trustee, plan administrator or other fiduciary, and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of such
Indemnified Party. The repeal or amendment of this Article VI or of any
Section or provision thereof which would have the effect of limiting,
qualifying or restricting any of the powers or rights of indemnification
provided or permitted in this Article VI shall not, solely by reason of such
repeal of amendment, eliminate, restrict or otherwise affect the right or
power of the corporation to indemnify any person, or affect any right of
indemnification of such person, with respect to any acts or omissions which
occurred prior to such repeal or amendment.

 



 

 **Section 6.10 **_Insurance_. By action of the Board of Directors,
notwithstanding any interest of the directors in such action, the corporation
may purchase and maintain insurance, in such amounts as the board may deem
appropriate, on behalf of any Indemnified Party against any liability asserted
against him or her and incurred by him or her in his or her capacity of or
arising out of his or her status as an Indemnified Party, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability under this Article VI, the Articles of Incorporation or applicable
provisions of law.

 



 

 **Section 6.11** _Right to Impose Conditions to Indemnification_. The
corporation shall have the right to impose, as conditions to any
indemnification provided or permitted in this Article VI, such reasonable
requirements and conditions as to the Board of Directors or stockholders may
appear appropriate in each specific case and circumstances, including but not
limited to any one or more of the following: (a) that any counsel
representing the person to be indemnified in connection with the defense or
settlement of any Action shall be counsel mutually agreeable to the person to
be indemnified and to the corporation; (b) that the corporation shall have the
right, at its option, to assume and control the defense or settlement of any
claim or proceeding made, initiated or threatened against the person to be
indemnified; and (c) that the corporation shall be subrogated, to the extent
of any payments made by way of indemnification, to all of the indemnified
persons right of recovery, and that the person to be indemnified shall
execute all writings and do everything necessary to assure such rights of
subrogation to the corporation.

Eldorado Holdco LLC

Ladies and Gentleman:

 



 

We have acted as counsel for Eldorado Holdco LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the proposed simultaneous
mergers of (i) Ridgeline Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub A_ "), with and into MTR Gaming
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _MTR_ " and such merger, the " _MTR
Merger_ ") and (ii) Éclair Acquisition Company, LLC, a Nevada limited
liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub B_ ")
with and into the Company (such merger, " _Company Merger_ ," and together
with the MTR Merger, the " _Mergers_ ") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger by and among MTR, Eclair Holdings Company, a Nevada corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of MTR (" _Parent_ "), Merger Sub A, Merger Sub B, the
Company, and the Member Representatives party thereto, dated September 9, 2013
(the " _Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings
specified in the Agreement.

 



 

In that connection, you have requested our opinion regarding certain United
States federal income tax consequences of the Mergers. In providing our
opinion, we have examined the Agreement, the Registration Statement, and such
other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of our opinion. We have not, however, undertaken any
independent investigation of any factual matter set forth in any of the
foregoing. In addition, we have assumed with your consent that (i) the Mergers
will be consummated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and the
Registration Statement (and no transaction or condition described therein and
affecting this opinion will be waived by any party), (ii) the statements
concerning the Mergers set forth in the Agreement and the Registration
Statement are true, complete and correct at all times up to and including the
Effective Time, (iii) the factual representations made by the Company and MTR,
in their respective letters dated the date hereof and delivered to us for
purposes of this opinion (the " _Representation Letters_ ") are true, complete
and correct as of the date hereof and will remain true, complete and correct
at all times up to and including the Effective Time and (iv) any factual
representations made in the Representation Letters "to the knowledge of" or
similarly qualified are correct without such qualification. We

      
 

 



 

have also assumed that the parties have complied with and, if applicable, will
continue to comply with, the covenants contained in the Agreement. If any of
the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the Mergers
are consummated in a manner that is different from the manner in which they
are described in the Agreement or the Registration Statement, our opinions as
expressed below might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.

 



 

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth herein, it is our opinion that, under currently
applicable United States federal income tax law, the Company Merger, when
combined with the MTR Merger, will be treated as a transfer of property to
Parent as described in Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ").

 



 

This opinion is rendered only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no
obligation to update the opinion after the date hereof. Our opinion is based
on the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, Internal Revenue
Service rulings and other administrative pronouncements interpreting the
foregoing, and pertinent judicial authority, all as in effect on the date
hereof. Any amendment or change in the interpretation of the applicable laws
or the facts and circumstances surrounding the Mergers, or any inaccuracy in
the statements, facts, assumptions or representations upon which we have
relied, might affect the continuing validity of our opinions as set forth
herein. We assume no responsibility to inform you of any such change or
inaccuracy that might occur or come to our attention subsequent to the date of
this opinion. Finally, our opinion is limited to the tax matters specifically
covered herein, and we have not been asked to address, nor have we addressed,
any other tax consequences of the Mergers, including any tax consequences
under state, local, foreign, or, except to the extent specifically set forth
herein, any United States federal law.

 



 

This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to the Agreement and it may
not be relied upon for any other purpose or provided to or relied upon by any
other person or entity, without our specific, prior, written consent.

Re: Merger of MTR Gaming Group, Inc.

 



 

Gentlemen:

 



 

We have been requested to provide this opinion concerning certain matters of
U.S. federal income tax law in connection with the proposed mergers (the
"Mergers") pursuant to which (1) Ridgeline Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Delaware Merger Sub") will merge with and into MTR Gaming Group,
Inc, a Delaware corporation ("MTR") with MTR surviving the Merger (the "MTR
Merger"), and (2) Eclair Acquisition Company, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company ("Nevada Merger Sub") will merge with and into Eldorado Holdco, LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company ("Eldorado") with Eldorado surviving the
Merger (the "Eldorado Merger"), all pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of September 9, 2013, among MTR, Eldorado, Eclair Holdings
Company, a Nevada corporation ("Parent"), and Thomas Reeg, Robert Jones and
Gary Carano as Member Representative (the "Merger Agreement"). The Mergers are
further described in and will be in accordance with the Registration Statement
filed by Parent (the "Registration Statement"), and related exhibits thereto.
This opinion is being provided in accordance with Section 6.3(j) of the Merger
Agreement.

 



 

We have acted as counsel to MTR in connection with the Mergers. As such, and
for purposes of providing this opinion, we have examined and are relying upon
(without any independent verification or review thereof) the truth and
accuracy, at all relevant times, of the statements, covenants, representations
and warranties contained in the following documents (including all schedules
and exhibits thereto): (1) the Registration Statement; (2) the Merger
Agreement; (3) the representations made by MTR and Eldorado in their
respective letters dated the date hereof and delivered to us for purposes of
this opinion (the "Representation Letters"); and (4) such other instruments
and documents related to MTR, Eldorado, and their affiliated companies as we
have deemed necessary or appropriate.

 



 

In addition, in connection with providing this opinion, we have assumed
(without any independent investigation thereof) that: (1) original documents
(including signatures) are

      
 

 



 

authentic; documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original
documents; and there has been due execution and delivery of all documents
where due execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness
thereof; (2) any representation or statement referred to above made "to the
best of knowledge" or otherwise similarly qualified is correct without such
qualification, and all statements and representations, whether or not
qualified, are true and will remain true; and (3) the Mergers will be
consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement and will be effective under the
laws of the State of Delaware (for the MTR Merger) and the State of Nevada
(for the Eldorado Merger).

 



 

Based on the foregoing documents, materials, assumptions and information, and
subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, if the Mergers
are consummated in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement (and
without any waiver, breach or amendment of any of the provisions thereof), it
is our opinion that, under current law the MTR Merger, when combined with the
Eldorado Merger, will be treated as a transfer of property to Parent by the
shareholders of MTR as described in Section 351(a) or Section 351(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

 



 

Our opinion set forth above is based on the existing provisions of the Code,
Treasury Regulations (including Temporary Treasury Regulations) promulgated
under the Code, published Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures and other
announcements of the Internal Revenue Service ("Service") and existing court
decisions, any of which could be changed at any time. Any such changes might
be retroactive with respect to transactions entered into prior to the date of
such changes and could significantly modify the opinion set forth above.

 



 

As you are aware, no ruling has been or will be requested from the Service
concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers. In
reviewing this opinion, you should be aware that the opinion set forth above
represents our conclusion regarding the application of existing U.S. federal
income tax law to the instant transaction. If the facts vary from those relied
upon (or if any representation, covenant, warranty or assumption upon which we
have relied is inaccurate, incomplete, breached or ineffective), our opinion
contained herein could be inapplicable in whole or in part. You should be
aware that an opinion of counsel represents only counsels best legal
judgment, and has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and that
no assurance can be given that contrary positions may not be taken by the
Service or that a court considering the issues would not hold otherwise.
