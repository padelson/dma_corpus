waiver, agreement or action and the performance by Buyer of the obligations
thereunder. The applicable Asset Seller shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer
promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by
such Asset Seller or an Affiliate thereof in respect of Buyer's performance of
any such Contract, or Governmental Permit (net of any Taxes and any other costs
imposed upon Seller) in connection with the arrangements under this SECTION 2.3.

      bond), except, in each case, to the extent related to Debt owed to a
      Third Party or Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
      Purchased Entities);

            (xiv) any Liability with respect to Taxes for which Buyer is liable
      under SECTION 8.2; and

            (xv) any Liability for which Buyer is liable under SECTION 8.13.

Without limiting Buyer's rights under ARTICLE XI, Buyer's obligations under this
SECTION 2.4(A) shall not be subject to offset or reduction, whether by reason of
any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered in
connection herewith or any right of indemnification hereunder, thereunder or
otherwise.

            (b) EXCLUDED LIABILITIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      in this Agreement, Assumed Liabilities shall not include and Buyer shall
      not assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge or in
      any way be liable for any Liabilities of any Asset Seller that does not
      constitute an Assumed Liability whether or not related to the Business or
      the Assets (all such Liabilities not assumed by Buyer being referred to
      herein as the "EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"). Without limiting the generality of
      the foregoing, the following Liabilities of the Asset Sellers shall be
      considered to be Excluded Liabilities for all purposes under this
      Agreement:

            (i) any Liability with respect to Taxes for which Seller or any
      Selling Entity is liable under SECTION 8.2;

            (ii) any Liability for costs and expenses (other than as set forth
      in SECTION 8.5) in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
      Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered in connection
      herewith or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
      thereby;

            (iii) any Liability of Seller or any Selling Entity under this
      Agreement or under any other agreement between Seller and its Affiliates,
      on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, entered
      into on or after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
      hereof;

            (iv) any intercompany accounts (including payables) among Seller and
      its Affiliates relating to the Business, which accounts shall be settled
      pursuant to SECTION 7.6;

            (v) Subject to SECTION 7.14, any Liabilities for Debt of the Asset
      Sellers owed to Third Parties or Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
      than the Purchased Entities);


                                       25

            (vi) any Liabilities relating to, resulting from or arising out of
      Nutriceutical Products sold or manufactured by the Asset Sellers prior to
      the Closing Date;

            (vii) any Liabilities relating to Transferred Employees or any other
      employees of Seller or any Affiliate thereof which are retained by Seller

      other Liabilities for employee benefits and compensation that remain the
      responsibility of Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to SECTION 8.3;

            (viii) any Liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of
      the Excluded Assets and any other assets not transferred to and not
      purchased by Buyer;

            (ix) any Liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of any
      Action to the extent relating to, resulting from or arising out of conduct
      of the Asset Sellers or the Business or relating to or resulting from
      incidents, events, facts or circumstances existing or occurring on or
      prior to the Closing Date (other than Liabilities relating to, arising out
      of or resulting from Actions or conduct of the Asset Sellers or the
      Business or relating to or resulting from incidents, events, facts or
      circumstances that is the subject matter of CLAUSE (IV), (VIII), (X) or
      (XV) of SECTION 2.4(A));

            (x) any Liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of any
      Divested Business or any products sold or manufactured by the Asset
      Sellers that are discontinued prior to the Closing Date;

            (xi) any Liability related to any Environmental Claim to the extent
      that the underlying event or circumstance that is the basis for the
      Environmental Claim arose or occurred on or prior to the Closing Date;

            (xii) any Liabilities relating to, resulting from or arising out of
      any violation of Requirements of Law occurring, or relating to or
      resulting from incidents, events, facts or circumstances existing or
      occurring, on or prior to the Closing Date (other than Liabilities
      relating to, arising out of or resulting from Actions, violations or
      conduct or relating to or resulting from incidents, events, facts or
      circumstances that is the subject matter of CLAUSE (IV), (VIII), (X) or
      (XV) of SECTION 2.4(A) and other than Tax Liabilities);

            (xiii) any Liabilities relating to, resulting from or arising out of
      claims of infringement or other misappropriation of the Intellectual
      Property rights of Third Parties with respect to the design, testing,
      manufacturing, marketing, use, sale lease or importation of products prior
      to the Closing Date;

            (xiv) any other Liabilities under Contracts that are not assigned or
      transferred to Buyer, except to the extent provided in SECTION 2.3;

            (xv) any Liability for punitive damages relating to, resulting from
      or arising out of the conduct of the Asset Sellers or the Business on or
      prior to the Closing Date;

            (xvi) any Liability for which Seller is liable pursuant to SECTION
      8.13; and


                                       26
<PAGE>

            (xvii) any Internal Restructuring Liability (other than any Tax
      Liability, which is subject to SECTION 8.2).

            Seller shall cause the Asset Sellers to pay, perform and otherwise
discharge fully and timely (without recourse to Buyer) all Excluded Liabilities.

            Without limiting Seller's rights under ARTICLE XI, Seller's
obligations under this SECTION 2.4(B) shall not be subject to offset or
reduction, whether by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement or document delivered in connection herewith or any right of
indemnification hereunder, thereunder or otherwise.

            (c) SELLER ASSUMED LIABILITIES. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall or shall cause one or
more of its Affiliates that is not a Purchased Entity to assume, and hereby
agrees to or to cause such Affiliate to pay, perform and otherwise discharge
fully and timely, all of the Liabilities of the Purchased Entities that would be
"Excluded Liabilities" or would not be "Assumed Liabilities" if such Purchased
Entity were an Asset Seller (the "SELLER ASSUMED LIABILITIES").

                                   ARTICLE III
                                 PURCHASE PRICE

            SECTION 3.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price for the Securities
and the Assets shall be equal to $557,000,000 (five hundred fifty seven
million), as may be adjusted pursuant to SECTION 3.2 (the "PURCHASE PRICE"). The
Purchase Price or, if the Purchase Price has not been finally determined
pursuant to SECTION 3.2 prior to the Closing, $557,000,000 (five hundred fifty
seven million) shall be paid by Buyer pursuant to SECTION 4.2.

            SECTION 3.2 PRE-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP or
such other accounting firm of international recognition acceptable to Seller and
Buyer (the "AUDITORS") to audit (the "AUDIT") as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof the balance sheets as of July 2, 2005, July 3, 2004
and June 28, 2003 for the Business and a statement of operations for the three
years ended July 2, 2005 for the Business, and, upon completion of the Audit, to
deliver simultaneously to Seller and Buyer: (i) such financial statements
(including the notes thereto) with such adjustments as necessary to permit the
Auditors to deliver the hereinafter described audit report (the "AUDITED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"); and (ii) an audit report stating (without qualification)
that in its opinion the Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Business on July 2, 2005 and the results of its operations for
the respective periods covered thereby (the "AUDIT REPORT"). All fees and
expenses of the Auditors with respect to the Audit shall be borne by Seller.

            (b) Within 10 business days after Seller's and Buyer's receipt of
the Audit Report, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "AUDITED EBITDA
STATEMENT") of an amount equal to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization from the Audited



                                       27
<PAGE>

Financial Statements (the "AUDITED EBITDA"), which Audited EBITDA Statement and
Audited EBITDA shall be prepared in accordance with the principles set forth on
and used to prepare EXHIBIT P attached hereto.

            (c) Buyer and its independent public accountants may review and
object to the Audited EBITDA Statement and may make reasonable inquiries of
Seller and the Auditors with respect to the Audited EBITDA Statement, who shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in its review of the Audited EBITDA Statement.
The Audited EBITDA Statement shall become final and binding on Buyer and Seller
on the 10th business day after the date the Audited EBITDA Statement is received
by Buyer unless Buyer has delivered to Seller a written notice of Buyer's
disagreement, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
disagreement(s) Buyer has with respect to the Audited EBITDA Statement (an
"AUDIT OBJECTION NOTICE"). The only disagreements that may be set forth in the
Audit Objection Notice pursuant to this SECTION 3.2(C) are those that relate to
(A) any claimed inconsistencies between the principles used in the preparation
of the Audited EBITDA Statement and the principles set forth on and used to
prepare EXHIBIT P; (B) errors in mathematical computation; or (C) whether any
non-recurring charge excluded from the calculation of Audited EBITDA was
appropriately classified as a non-recurring charge as described in footnote 1 of
EXHIBIT P. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 3.2, no
disagreement set forth in the Audit Objection Notice may relate to the
preparation of the Audit, the Audited Financial Statements, any adjustments to
the Financial Statements or any differences between the Audited Financial
Statements, on the one hand, and the Financial Statements on the other hand,
provided that the Audited EBITDA Statement and Audited EBITDA were prepared in
accordance with SECTION 3.2(B). If a valid Audit Objection Notice is received by
Seller in a timely manner, then the Audited EBITDA Statement (as finally
determined in accordance with CLAUSE (I) or (II) below) shall become final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date the
parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to all matters
specified in the Audit Objection Notice and (ii) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm.

            (d) If Buyer delivers a valid Audit Objection Notice to Seller
within such 10 business day period, Seller and Buyer shall, during the five
business days after Seller has received the Audit Objection Notice (the
"RESOLUTION PERIOD"), negotiate in good faith and use reasonable best efforts to
resolve by written agreement their differences as to the Audited EBITDA
Statement. Any resolution by them as to the Audited EBITDA Statement shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller.

            (e) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer
have not resolved all disputes relating to the Audited EBITDA Statement set
forth in the Audit Objection Notice, then all such disputes that have not been
resolved shall be submitted for resolution to the New York, New York office of
Deloitte & Touche LLP (unless Deloitte & Touche LLP is used by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates for audit purposes) or such other accounting firm of
international recognition mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer (the "AUDIT
RESOLUTION ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The Audit Resolution Accounting Firm shall not be
an accounting firm used by either Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates for audit purposes. If requested by the Audit Resolution Accounting
Firm, Seller and Buyer agree to execute a reasonable


                                       28
<PAGE>

engagement letter. All fees and expenses of the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm
under this SECTION 3.2 shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. Seller and
Buyer shall direct the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm to render a
determination as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later
than 30 days) after its engagement, and Seller, Buyer and their respective
agents will cooperate with the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm during its
engagement. Seller shall provide the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm such
documents, records and work papers of Seller and its Affiliates and provide
access at reasonable times to Seller's and its Affiliates' financial and
accounting personnel as the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm shall reasonably
request. The Audit Resolution Accounting Firm will limit its review to only
those issues in the Audited EBITDA Statement that are in dispute as permitted by
SECTION 3.2(C) and its determination with respect to such issues shall be set
forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer, and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on all parties. The final Audited EBITDA calculation, as
determined by Buyer and Seller or the Audit Resolution Accounting Firm, as the
case may be, shall be referred to as the "FINAL AUDITED EBITDA."

            (f) If the Final Audited EBITDA is less than $64,000,000, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount (the "ADJUSTMENT DECREASE
AMOUNT") equal to the product of (i) $64,000,000 MINUS the Final Audited EBITDA
and (ii) 9.

            (g) Seller and Buyer agree that if the resolution of any dispute
described in an Audit Objection Notice extends beyond the thirty-day period
described in SECTION 3.2(E), Seller and Buyer shall nonetheless, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, subject to SECTION 4.1, consummate the Closing. In such
case, no later than two business days after the Adjustment Decrease Amount is
finally determined pursuant to this SECTION 3.2, if the Purchase Price is
required to be decreased pursuant to this SECTION 3.2, then the Purchase Price
shall be so decreased and Seller shall immediately pay Buyer the Adjustment
Decrease Amount, together with interest at an annual rate equal to the
three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis
of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to but excluding the payment
date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of any dispute
described in an Audit Objection Notice to be resolved on or prior to the 30-day
period described in SECTION 3.2(E) shall not constitute a failure by Seller to
have performed its obligations under this Agreement such that the Closing
condition under SECTION 9.4 has not been satisfied.

            (h) As soon as practicable following the date hereof but in any
event no later than 45 days after the date hereof (or such other date mutually
agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement), Buyer and Seller shall
cause their respective actuaries to jointly determine the excess of (i) the
projected benefit obligations under the Defined Benefit Pension Plans (other
than the Sara Lee UK Pension Plan) and any other Employee Benefit Plan that is a
supplemental defined benefit pension plan to be assumed by Buyer (based on
actuarial valuations calculated, and based upon interest rates consistent with
GAAP (or such other local accounting rules as may be applicable and agreed to by
Buyer's and Seller's respective actuaries), as of June 30, 2005) over (ii) the
assets associated with such Defined Benefit Pension Plans (other than the Sara
Lee UK Pension Plan) and such supplemental defined benefit pension plans which
will be transferred to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 8.3 (the "EXCESS PBO"). If the
Excess PBO cannot be agreed upon


                                       29
<PAGE>

between Seller's actuaries and Buyer's actuaries within such 45 days (or such
later date as agreed to by the parties), then Buyer and Seller shall, within
five days of such failure to agree, agree on a Third Party independent actuary,
which shall determine the Excess PBO (based on similar valuations and interest
rates) prior to the Closing Date, whose expenses shall be borne 50% by Buyer and
50% by Seller, and whose determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on
all parties. The Excess PBO as finally determined by Seller's and Buyer's
actuaries or such independent actuary, as applicable, shall be referred to as
the "FINAL EXCESS PBO." If the Final Excess PBO exceeds $13,000,000, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount by which the Final Excess PBO
exceeds $13,000,000. If the Final Excess PBO is less than $13,000,000, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the Final Excess PBO is
less than $13,000,000. Seller and Buyer agree that if the resolution of any
dispute described in this SECTION 3.2(H) extends beyond the time when Seller and
Buyer would otherwise effect the Closing, they shall nonetheless, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, subject to SECTION 4.1, consummate the
Closing. In such case, no later than two business days after the Final Excess
PBO is finally determined pursuant to this SECTION 3.2(H), (i) if the Final
Excess PBO exceeds $13,000,000, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
amount of such excess, together with interest at an annual rate equal to
three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis
of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date but excluding the payment
date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by Buyer and (ii) if the Final Excess PBO is less than $13,000,000,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such deficit, together with
interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the
Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the
Closing Date but excluding the payment date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by Seller. For the avoidance
of doubt, the failure of any dispute described in this SECTION 3.2(H) to be
resolved on or prior to the period described in this SECTION 3.2(H) shall not
constitute a failure by Seller to have performed its obligations under this
Agreement such that the Closing condition under SECTION 9.4 has not been
satisfied.

            SECTION 3.3 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) Within
30 days after the Closing Date, or, if the Purchase Price is not finally
determined pursuant to SECTION 3.2 until after the Closing Date, 30 days after
the date the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to SECTION 3.2, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "CLOSING DATE WORKING
CAPITAL STATEMENT") setting forth Working Capital as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the determination of Working Capital, as it may be adjusted
under this SECTION 3.3 in the event of a Working Capital Objection Notice, is
referred to as "FINAL WORKING CAPITAL"). Seller shall reasonably assist Buyer
and its representatives in the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement and shall provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access at
all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Companies for such purpose.

            (b) The Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall become final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties on the 15th day following receipt
thereof by Seller unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement
("WORKING CAPITAL OBJECTION NOTICE") to Buyer before such date. A Working
Capital Objection Notice pursuant to this SECTION 3.3(B) must set forth Seller's
determination of Final Working Capital and specify in reasonable detail


                                       30
<PAGE>

the nature of any disagreement with Buyer's determination. The only
disagreements that may be set forth in the Working Capital Objection Notice
pursuant to this SECTION 3.3(B) are those that relate to any claimed
inconsistencies between the principles used in the preparation of the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement, on the one hand, and the principles used in
preparing the Reference Working Capital as set forth on EXHIBIT Q (other than
that the Working Capital shall be as of the Closing Date rather than an average)
and Seller's Accounting Principles, on the other hand, or errors in mathematical
computation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 3.3, no
disagreement set forth in the Working Capital Objection Notice may relate to the
principles used in the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement, so long as those principles are consistent with Seller's Accounting
Principles and the principles used in preparing the Reference Working Capital as
set forth on EXHIBIT Q; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Working Capital shall be as
of the Closing Date rather than an average. If a valid Working Capital Objection
Notice is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital (as finally determined in
accordance with CLAUSE (I) or (II) below) shall become final, conclusive and
binding upon Buyer and Seller on the earlier of (i) the date the parties resolve
in writing any differences they have with respect to all matters specified in
the Working Capital Objection Notice and (ii) the date any disputed matters are
finally resolved in writing by the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm.

            (c) During the 15-day period following the delivery of a Working
Capital Objection Notice, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to each matter
specified in the Working Capital Objection Notice. If, at the end of such 15-day
period, Seller and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such matters, then
the matters that remain in dispute shall be promptly submitted to a working
capital resolution accounting firm, which shall be the Audit Resolution
Accounting Firm (the "WORKING CAPITAL RESOLUTION ACCOUNTING FIRM") for review
and resolution. If requested by the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm,
Seller and Buyer agree to execute a reasonable engagement letter. The Working
Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties in writing,
provided that the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm will not be an
accounting firm used by either Seller or Buyer or any of their Affiliates for
audit or valuation purposes. The procedures for the arbitration shall be
determined by the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm. Buyer shall
provide the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm such documents, records
and work papers of Buyer and its Affiliates and provide access at reasonable
times to Buyer's and its Affiliates' financial and accounting personnel as the
Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall reasonably request. The Working
Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall render a decision resolving the matters
in dispute within 15 days following completion of the submissions to the Working
Capital Resolution Accounting Firm. Any item not specifically referred to in the
Working Capital Objection Notice shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding
on Buyer and Seller in the manner set forth in the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement. The Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall determine Final
Working Capital based solely on presentations made by Seller and Buyer (and not
by independent review).

            (d) The Non-Prevailing Party in any arbitration before the Working
Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall pay its own expenses incurred with
respect to the arbitration and shall pay a percentage of (i) the fees and
expenses of the Working Capital Resolution


                                       31
<PAGE>

Accounting Firm PLUS (ii) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) of the other party incurred with respect to the
arbitration, which percentage shall be calculated by DIVIDING (A) an amount
equal to the difference between the Non-Prevailing Party's determination of
Final Working Capital, as submitted to the Working Capital Resolution Accounting
Firm, and the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm's determination of
Final Working Capital by (B) an amount equal to the difference between the
parties' respective determinations of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the
Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm. The other party shall pay the
remainder of the fees and expenses of the Working Capital Resolution Accounting
Firm and its own expenses not required to be paid by the Non-Prevailing Party
hereunder. A party is the "NON-PREVAILING PARTY" if the Working Capital
Resolution Accounting Firm's determination of Final Working Capital is closer to
the other party's determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the
Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm, than it is to that party's
determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the Working Capital
Resolution Accounting Firm. In resolving any matter specified in the Working
Capital Objection Notice, the Working Capital Resolution Accounting Firm shall
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party.

            (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "REFERENCE WORKING CAPITAL"
means $42,000,000.00. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by
which Final Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working Capital, or the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which Final Working Capital
is less than the Reference Working Capital (the Purchase Price as increased or
decreased by the adjustment provided for in this sentence is referred to as the
"ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE"; if no such adjustment is required, then the Adjusted
Purchase Price shall equal the Purchase Price). If the Purchase Price is less
than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Purchase Price is more
than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall, within 5 business days after the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement becomes final and binding on the parties,
make payment to the other party of the amount of such difference, together with
interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate in effect
as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed
from the Closing Date to but excluding the payment date.

            (f) The term "WORKING CAPITAL" means (i) the sum of the amounts
reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement under the captions
"Accounts Receivable (net of bad debt reserves)," "Inventories (net of
appropriate reserves)," "Prepaid Expenses," "Other Current Assets" and
"Adjustment for Receivable for the Sale of Household & Body Care in Brazil,"
MINUS (ii) the sum of the amounts reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement under the captions "Accounts Payable, Total," and "Accrued Expenses,
Total," as calculated in accordance with Seller's Accounting Principles and, in
all other respects, prepared and calculated in the same manner as the Reference
Working Capital set forth on EXHIBIT Q and excluding from each of the
above-referenced captions amounts for allocation of corporate overhead and
divested operating companies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) Working Capital shall
be as of the Closing Date rather than an average and (B) Working Capital shall
not reflect any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or Seller Assumed
Liabilities and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not reflect any intercompany
accounts between Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Companies and their Subsidiaries,


                                       32
<PAGE>

on the other hand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
computation of Working Capital will be done in a manner consistent with Seller's
Accounting Principles and the manner of calculating the Reference Working
Capital as set forth on EXHIBIT Q (other than that the Working Capital shall be
as of the Closing Date rather than an average), and the governing principle will
be that the adjustment contemplated by this SECTION 3.3(F) can be appropriately
measured only when the Reference Working Capital and the Final Working Capital
are computed on the same basis, using the same principles and methodologies;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Working Capital shall be as of the Closing Date rather
than an average. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Working
Capital shall not include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or Seller
Assumed Liabilities and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not reflect any
intercompany accounts between Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies
and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Companies and their
Subsidiaries, on the other hand. The currency exchange rate for the Working
Capital shall be the exchange rate at which, in accordance with its customary
procedures Seller could purchase United States Dollars with the applicable
currency in New York, New York on the Closing Date.

            SECTION 3.4 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller (on behalf of it, and as agent for the Selling Entities) shall
prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price and any other consideration to be
paid to, or for the benefit of, a Selling Entity, including the Assumed
Liabilities, among the Selling Entities. Such allocation shall be reasonable and
shall be prepared in accordance with the principles of section 1060 of the Code
and the regulations thereunder. Buyer agrees that within 10 business days
following receipt of such allocation, it shall notify Seller of any
disagreements with such allocation and thereafter negotiate with Seller to agree
on any necessary revisions. The allocation of any consideration paid after the
Closing Date shall be determined in a similar manner.

            (b) Within 20 days following the determination of Final Working
Capital, Seller (on behalf of it, and as agent for the applicable Selling
Entity) shall prepare a schedule (the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE") allocating the
Purchase Price and any other consideration paid to, or for the benefit of, an
Asset Seller or with respect to any Purchased Entity for which a Non-U.S.
Section 338 Election is made, as determined in SECTION 3.4(A), among the Assets
sold by that Asset Seller or the assets of such Purchased Entity. The Allocation
Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Buyer agrees that within 10
business days following receipt of such Allocation Schedule, it shall notify
Seller of any disagreements with such allocation and thereafter negotiate with
Seller to agree on any necessary revisions. Seller and Buyer each agrees that
promptly after receiving such Allocation Schedule it shall return an executed
copy thereof to the other party. Within 30 days following an indemnification
payment made pursuant to ARTICLE XI, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to agree to a revised purchase price allocation to reflect such
indemnification payment in accordance with the nature of each such adjustment.
Seller and Buyer agree, for all Tax purposes, to allocate any indemnification
payment made pursuant to ARTICLE XI among the Purchased Entities and Assets
based upon the item or items to which such adjustment is principally
attributable.

            (c) If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the amounts and allocations
described in SECTION 3.4(A) or (B) within 20 business days after Buyer has

by and mutually acceptable to both parties ("UNRELATED ACCOUNTING FIRM"). Seller
(and to the extent applicable, each Selling Entity) and Buyer each agrees to,
and to cause its Affiliates to, file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule, unless otherwise required by Requirements of Law or pursuant to a
determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Requirements of Law).

            (d) Seller and Buyer each agree to provide the other promptly with
any other information required to complete Form 8594.

            SECTION 3.5 TAX WITHHOLDING. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the payments
to be made pursuant to this Agreement any Taxes required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payments under applicable
Requirements of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld pursuant to this
SECTION 3.5, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

5.5 (the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), have been compiled by management of the
Business from source documentation subject to the controls and procedures of
Seller's accounting systems. This source documentation is prepared in accordance
with Seller's Accounting Policies. The books, records and other financial
reports of Seller relating to the operations of the Business used by Seller as
source documentation for the Financial Statements are correct in all material
respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices.
Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 5.5, the Financial Statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position (in the case of statements of
financial position) and results of operations (in the case of statements of
income) of the Business as of the dates and for the periods set forth therein,
subject to certain adjustments described therein and subject to the omission of
footnotes.

condition of the Business at July 2, 2005 and the results of operations of the
Business for the respective period covered thereby, and will have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the period
involved.

            (c) The management of Seller has (i) designed and implemented
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to



                                       41

known to the management of Seller by others within those entities and (ii)

outside auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A) any

Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Seller's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Seller's internal controls over financing reporting. Since

financial reporting required by the Exchange Act to be disclosed in the reports
filed by Seller with the SEC has been so disclosed.

Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 5.6, since the Financial
Statements Date through the date of this Agreement, the Companies have conducted
the Business only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, except as set forth in

Agreement, the Companies have not taken any action or permitted or agreed to
take any action that would be prohibited to be taken, permitted or agreed to
under SECTION 7.4 between the date hereof and the Closing Date.

            SECTION 5.7     TAXES.  Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 5.7:

PENSION PLANS"). Each Employee Benefit Plan and each Required Plan is in
material compliance with all Requirements of Law applicable thereto and the
respective requirements of the governing documents for such Employee Benefit

against the Companies, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan or Required Plan or against any Employee Benefit
Plan or Required Plan (or related trust) which would, individually or in the

Effective as of the date hereof, no Employee of the Business actively
participates in any Employee Benefit Plan or Required Plan that is subject to
ERISA maintained by the Companies, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
or any other Person, and no circumstance exists, or is reasonably likely to
exist, which could subject Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Entities after Closing) to any liability under ERISA. For purposes of
this Agreement, each Employee Benefit Plan or Required Plan that is either (1)
maintained and sponsored solely by a Purchased Entity or (2) assumed by Buyer
and set forth in SCHEDULE 5.16(A)(2) hereto is hereinafter referred to as an
"ASSUMED PLAN" and each Assumed Plan and each other Employee Benefit Plan or
Required Plan for which Buyer receives assets or insurance contracts or
otherwise assumes liability with respect to shall be referred to as a "BUSINESS
PLAN."

            (b) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.16(B), with respect to each
Business Plan other than a Required Plan not maintained by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, Seller has heretofore delivered or made available to Buyer true and
complete copies of each of the following documents: (i) a copy of the plan (or
to the extent no such copy exists, an accurate written description thereof);
(ii) a copy of the most recent summary plan description and summary of material
modifications with respect thereto, to the extent these documents exist for such
plans; (iii) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement; and (iv) the
most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statements. Except as
specifically provided in the


                                       50
<PAGE>

foregoing documents delivered or made available to Buyer, there are no
amendments to any Business Plan other than a Required Plan not maintained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates that has been adopted or approved, nor has any
party undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new
Business Plan.

            (c) With respect to each Business Plan:

            (i) all employer and employee payments, contributions or accruals
      (including premiums) required by law or by the terms of such Business Plan
      have been made when due, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with
      "FAS 87";

            (ii) each such Business Plan required to be registered has been
      registered (including, where applicable, pursuant to the UK Pension
      Schemes Act of 1993) and has been maintained in good standing with
      applicable Requirements of Law and regulatory authorities (including the
      UK Pension Schemes Act of 1993), except for failure to so register and
      maintain which would not result in a material liability to Buyer;

            (iii) all amounts required to be reserved with respect to such
      Business Plan have been so reserved in accordance with normal accounting
      practices prevailing in the country where such Business Plan is
      maintained; and

            (iv) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, each such
      Business Plan complies in all material respects with all requirements for
      such treatment, and no circumstances exist that might give reason to any
      applicable Governmental Body to revoke such treatment, except where any
      such revocation would not result in a material liability to Buyer.

            (d) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.16(D), neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase in
any material respect the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any
employee or director of the Companies, or result in any material limitation on
the right of the Companies to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Employee Benefit Plan or Required Plan or their related trusts.
Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 5.16(D), no amount paid or payable (whether in
cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Companies or their
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of section 280G of the Code, or would constitute an "excess parachute payment"
if such amounts were subject to the provisions of section 280G of the Code.

            SECTION 5.17 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Except as disclosed on
SCHEDULE 5.17 and other than those matters which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

            (a) the Companies are currently complying, and at all times have

material respects valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services
actually performed by a Company in the ordinary course of business. Such
accounts receivable will be in all material respects current and collectible net
of the reserves applied in calculating accounts receivable (net) in the Final
Working Capital (which reserves will be adequate in all material respects). As

Purchased Entities and the inventory included in the Assets (taking into account
the dollar amount reserved or deducted in calculating inventory (net) in the
Final Working Capital) ("INVENTORY") will in all material respects be current,
non-obsolete, neither damaged nor defective, saleable in the ordinary course
and, to the Knowledge of Seller, merchantable and fit for the purpose for which
it was procured or manufactured. At the Closing, the Inventory will be at levels
sufficient for Buyer to conduct the Business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.

      prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
      thereby; and

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer agrees that such
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operations of Seller, the Companies or the Selling
Entities. Prior to Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
identify services currently provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other

FURTHER, that neither Buyer nor its officers, employees or authorized
representatives may contact any such Third Party (other than Governmental
Bodies) without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

            (b) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use (and will cause its Affiliates, officers,
employees and directors, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
agents, accountants and representatives to use) its reasonable best efforts to

in such form and from such financial institutions satisfactory to the holder of
such Identified Guaranty; and (b) cause Seller or such Affiliate to be fully

<PAGE>

any of its Affiliates after the date hereof in accordance with SECTION 7.4(B) or
those that prior to the Closing Date Seller notifies Buyer in writing were
inadvertently omitted from SCHEDULE 7.7 (but only to the extent such
inadvertently omitted items are not, individually or in the aggregate, material
in amount) (the "OTHER GUARANTIES"), Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) to be fully
released, in each case, effective as promptly as practicable, in respect of all
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) and
under any such Other Guaranties. If, at or prior to the Closing, Buyer is unable

after using reasonable best efforts to do so or; (ii) any Identified Guaranty,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Purchased

Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Entities) to, renew, extend, amend or supplement any loan, contract,
lease or other obligation that is covered by an Other Guaranty or an Identified
Guaranty without providing Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Seller that Seller's or any of its Affiliate's Other Guaranty or Identified
Guaranty has been released. Any cash or other collateral posted by Seller or one
of its Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities) in respect of any Other
Guaranty or any Identified Guaranty shall be promptly delivered to Seller or
such Affiliate.

the contrary in this Agreement, all receipts held by the Companies on or before
the Closing Date, including cash, checks and bank drafts (whether cleared before

the Closing) shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Buyer shall cause payment in an aggregate amount equal to such receipts to be
made to Seller immediately after Seller makes demand therefor.

            SECTION 7.9 NUTRIMETICS MALAYSIA; PHILIPPINES; NOMINEES. (a) Prior
to Closing Buyer shall have either (i) elected that the Other Nutrimetics
Malaysia Equity Holders remain as equity holders of Nutrimetics Malaysia (but
only if the Other Nurtimetics Malaysia Equity Holders have consented in writing)
or (ii) have arranged for a Person that complies with the Bumiputera equity
requirements of local Requirements of Law to purchase the outstanding Capital
Stock of Nutrimetics Malaysia held by the Other Nutrimetics Malaysia Equity
Holders and shall have notified Seller in writing of the identify of such
Person. Subject to this SECTION 7.9. Seller shall instruct the Other Nutrimetics
Malaysia Equity Holders to sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to such
Person all of the outstanding Capital Stock of Nutrimetics Malaysia owned by
such Other Nutrimetics Malaysia Equity Holder, unless Buyer informs Seller in
writing that Buyer has elected that the Other Nutrimetics Malaysia Equity
Holders remain as equity holders and the Other Nutrimetics Malaysia Equity
Holders have consented in writing. Buyer and Seller agree that the instruments
of transfer for such Capital Stock will be without recourse or representation
except to the extent required by local Requirements of Law. Seller shall cause
Nutrimetics Australia (the other registered shareholder of Nutrimetics Malaysia

provide an express written waiver to Buyer of the right of first refusal in
respect of the transfer of shares by Bumiputera shareholders in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

those Securities to such Person or Persons as Buyer shall designate unless Buyer
informs Seller in writing that Buyer has elected for any such Person currently

Liabilities if Sara Lee Philippines were an Asset Seller and only such assets
that would be Assets if Sara Lee Philippines were an Asset Seller; (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do or
cause to be done, all things necessary, under Requirements of Law, to ensure
that Sara Lee Philippines transfer to SLDS Philippines, in a manner reasonably
acceptable to Buyer from a corporate perspective such assets and Liabilities;

            SECTION 7.11 ADVISE OF CHANGES. Seller and Buyer will each promptly
advise the other in writing of (and, with respect to any notice or
communication, provide to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, a copy of) (a)
any event to the Knowledge of Seller or the Knowledge of Buyer, as the case may
be, that would render any representation or warranty of either of Seller or
Buyer contained in this Agreement, if made on or as of the date of such event or
the Closing Date, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (b) any change,
condition or event that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (c) any failure of Seller or Buyer to comply in any
material respect with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by Seller or
Buyer; (d) any notice or other communication from any Third Party alleging that
the consent of such Third Party is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (e) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any notice delivered
under this SECTION 7.11 shall not be considered to be evidence of any untruth or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, or a change, event or development or
a failure to comply with any covenant or agreement hereunder unless the
underlying facts giving rise to such notice constitute such an untruth or
inaccuracy, change, event or development or failure to comply; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that a failure to comply with this SECTION 7.11 shall not cause the
failure of any condition set forth in ARTICLE IX or X to be satisfied unless the
underlying untruth or inaccuracy of a representation or warrant, or a change,
event or development or a failure to comply with any covenant or agreement
hereunder would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
ARTICLE XI or X to be satisfied.

            SECTION 7.12 FINANCING COOPERATION. Seller agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate, and to cause its officers and employees
and authorized representatives (including independent public accountants and
attorneys) to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that is
necessary in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing pursuant to
the Financing Commitment Letter in connection with the purchase by Buyer of the
Assets and Securities, including participation in meetings, due diligence
sessions, meetings with rating agencies and investors and road shows, drafting
sessions and obtaining "comfort letters" and consents from auditors; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing herein will require cooperation to the extent that it
would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of Seller or any of
its Affiliates; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing herein will require Seller or
any of its Affiliates to expend out-of-pocket money or execute any document in
connection with this SECTION 7.12 prior to the Closing. Buyer shall, promptly
upon the request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with such cooperation.

            SECTION 7.13    FINANCING OBLIGATION.

            (a) No later than 12:00 pm New York City Time on August 15, 2005
(the "MARKETING PERIOD"), Buyer shall duly execute and deliver to Lender and
Banc of America Securities LLC (with a copy to Seller) each of the BofA
Financing Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to the end of the Marketing
Period Buyer shall have the right to enter into alternative financing
arrangements if (i) during the Marketing Period Buyer is able to obtain a
commitment from a nationally recognized financial institution (the "ALTERNATE
LENDER") for alternative financing for at least $1,000,000,000.00 and which is
on terms no less favorable to


                                       67
<PAGE>

Buyer and Seller than the BofA Financing Documents; (ii) Buyer provides to
Seller the final versions of such documents with a reasonable time to review
them; (iii) Seller determines that the terms of the alternative financing
documents do not contain any conditions to the financing not included in the
BofA Financing Documents and are otherwise as favorable to Seller's interests as
the BofA Financing Documents (such determination to be evidenced in writing by
Seller delivered to Buyer and not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); and (iv) simultaneous with the execution by Buyer and any of its
Affiliates and the Alternate Lender and any of its Affiliates of the Alternate
Financing Documents, Buyer provides Seller with the Alternate Financing
Commitment Certificate duly executed by the Chief Financial Officer or General
Counsel of Buyer; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer shall be entitled to modify the
BofA Financing Documents prior to the end of the Marketing Period upon obtaining
the prior written consent of Seller of such modifications (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The obtaining of the
alternative financing described in this SECTION 7.13(A) shall be referred to as
the "ALTERNATE FINANCING" and the documents executed by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and the Alternate Lender or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the Alternate Financing shall be referred to as the "ALTERNATE FINANCING
DOCUMENTS."

            (b) Buyer will not, and will not permit any other Person to,
terminate, amend, modify or supplement (or consent or agree to the termination,
amendment, modification or supplementing of) in any respect the terms or
conditions of any Financing Documents, without the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of Seller).
Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Financing. If
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Financing Documents, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms substantially similar to the terms of the Financing Documents
and in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the
Financing Documents of which Buyer or any of its Affiliates becomes aware or any
termination of the Financing Documents. Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of the Financing and
provide copies of all documents related to the Financing (other than any
ancillary documents subject to confidentiality agreements) to Seller.

            SECTION 7.14    CASH/THIRD PARTY DEBT.

            (a) Subject to the following provisions, Buyer is purchasing and
Seller is selling the Purchased Entities on a cash-free basis and without Debt
to Third Parties or Seller and its post-Closing Affiliates (the "EXCLUDED
DEBT"), but the Purchased Entities are retaining any and all debt of a Purchased
Entity to another Purchased Entity (the "RETAINED DEBT"), which Retained Debt
will remain outstanding at the Closing. Buyer and Seller agree that any cash
remaining in any Purchased Entity at Closing (the "PRE-CLOSING CASH") is the
property of Seller (and not an asset of the Business or any Purchased Entity)
and Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including each
Purchased Entity) not to, use, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Pre-Closing
Cash without the prior written consent of Seller, which Seller may withhold in
its sole discretion. Seller agrees that it will use its good faith efforts to
extract any Pre-Closing Cash from the Purchased Entities prior to Closing,
except to the extent such extraction would


                                       68
<PAGE>

violate Requirements of Law (such as capital requirements and the amount of
distributable reserves).

            (b) Promptly after the date hereof, Buyer and Seller will work
together in good faith to analyze the expected Pre-Closing Cash and Excluded
Debt of each Purchased Entity and to design a mutually agreed plan for the
removal of Pre-Closing Cash from the Purchased Entities and repayment (or where
agreed, retention by a Purchased Entity) of Excluded Debt. Buyer and Seller will
negotiate in good faith any compensation to be paid between the parties for any
Excluded Debt that the parties agree will be retained by any Purchase Entity
(provided that any party may elect to not so agree). The extraction of
Pre-Closing Cash may entail intercompany loans, dividends, repayments of capital
or such other methods as the parties agree.

            (c) The parties agree that in designing a mutually agreed plan
(subject to Seller's consent as provided above) Buyer agrees that it will use
reasonable best efforts to remove such Pre-Closing Cash from the Purchased
Entity and pay it over to Seller, provided that Buyer and the Purchased Entities
will be fully indemnified and held harmless with respect to any Tax costs (but
not the cost of indirect Tax consequences resulting from the effect of any
reduction in distributable reserves, capital or earnings and profits) of
removing Pre-Closing Cash and shall pay to Seller only the projected after tax
amount of such cash, with true up payments as necessary. Anything in the
preceding sentence to the contrary notwithstanding, Buyer will have no
obligation to remove Pre-Closing Cash if in Buyer's good faith judgment it would
be impracticable or result in any out-of-pocket cost to Buyer that Seller would
not be willing to reimburse or other adverse effect to Buyer (any of the
foregoing, a "COST TO BUYER"), provided that in such case, Buyer will remain
obligated not to use, transfer or otherwise dispose of such cash without
Seller's express written consent and will consider in good faith INTER ALIA, a
restructuring which has no net adverse effect on Buyer (at Seller's expense and
request) or where appropriate, the use of such Pre-Closing Cash in Buyer's
business and will in each such case, make an appropriate payment to Seller of
the economic benefit to Buyer or the Business with respect to such Pre-Closing
Cash, net of any Cost to Buyer in doing so.

            (d) For the avoidance of doubt, any Pre-Closing Cash held by any
Purchased Entity or the Business as of the Closing will not be taken into
account in the calculation of Working Capital under SECTION 3.3 hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            SECTION 8.1 USE OF NAMES. (a) Other than the Trademarks identified
on SCHEDULE 5.11(A), Seller is not conveying ownership rights or, except as
expressly provided in the Seller Ancillary Agreements, granting Buyer or any
Purchased Entity a license to use any of the Trademarks of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller, including the Trademark or trade name "Sara Lee" or any
mark or name that is similar in sound or appearance to the "Sara Lee" mark or
name (collectively, the "RETAINED NAMES AND MARKS") and, after the Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Purchased Entity to, use in any manner
the Retained Names and Marks or any mark confusingly similar to the Retained
Names and Marks, except as provided in the Seller


                                       69
<PAGE>

Ancillary Agreements and this SECTION 8.1. In the event Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer violates any of its obligations under this SECTION 8.1 (and does not
use the Retained Names and Marks pursuant to any of the Seller Ancillary
Agreements), Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in
equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate,
provided Seller or an Affiliate of Seller gives Buyer or any Purchased Entity
notice of the violation and Buyer or the Purchased Entity does not cure the
violation within seven business days in the jurisdiction in which the violation
occurs following the notice or Seller and Buyer do not reach a mutually agreed
upon resolution. Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this SECTION 8.1 may
cause Seller and its Affiliates irreparable harm which may not be adequately
compensated for by money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of
any actual or threatened violation of this SECTION 8.1, subject to the notice
and cure requirement of the preceding sentence, Seller and each of its
Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have,
to a temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief
against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this
SECTION 8.1, without the necessity of posting a bond.

            (b) Except as expressly provided in the Seller Ancillary Agreements,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Purchased Entities to, cease promptly, but in
no event later than six months after the Closing Date, using any (i) existing
advertising or promotional materials, including brochures, catalogs, websites
and other similar items, and (ii) existing stationery, business cards, business
forms and other similar items, in each case that contain anywhere thereon any of
the Retained Names and Marks; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer shall, when using
items referred to in CLAUSE (II) in the context of entering into or conducting
contractual relationships, make reasonably clear to all other applicable parties
that Buyer or such Purchased Entity, rather than Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, is the party entering into or conducting the contractual relationship;
and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer shall ensure that personnel of the Purchased
Entities and of the Business using such items shall not, and shall have no
authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller. Buyer shall within 20 business days following the
Closing, amend the organizational documents of each Purchased Entity, as
applicable, to a name which does not include the Retained Names and Marks or any
word that is confusingly similar in sound or appearance to such names or marks.

            (c) Buyer shall have the right to exhaust all existing inventories
of finished products and existing work in progress that contain as part of the
physical products themselves any of the Retained Names and Marks, provided that
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to dispose of such finished products
promptly after the Closing Date.

            (d) Buyer shall have the right to (i) exhaust all existing packaging
that contains anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names and Marks ("MARKED
PACKAGING"), including the packaging for products described on SCHEDULE 8.1(D)
and (ii) prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, order or
purchase packaging containing the Retained Names and Marks and that is
substantially similar to the Marked Packaging; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no
event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates have any right to use any packaging
containing the Retained Names and Marks after the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date (and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, destroy at
Buyer's expense any and all packaging described in CLAUSE (I) or (II) promptly
thereafter).

<PAGE>

            (e) Other than as permitted under CLAUSES (B) through (D) above, the
Seller Ancillary Agreements, Buyer shall not use, without the prior written
consent of Seller, any of the Retained Names and Marks (or anything confusingly
similar thereto) in any manner whatsoever.

            (f) Nothing in this SECTION 8.1 shall limit or modify any rights or
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates or Buyer and its Affiliates under the
Ancillary Agreements.

            (g) Seller shall within 20 business days of the Closing, amend the
organizational documents of each Affiliate of Seller, as applicable, to a name
that does not include the Trademark or trade name "Nutrimetics," "House of
Fuller," "Fuller Cosmetics," "NaturCare," "Avroy," "Avroy Shlain," "Swissgarde,"
"Vlijmense Belegging-Maatschappij," "Nuvo Cosmeticos," "Nuage Cosmetics,"
"Probemex," or "Inmobiliaria Meck-Mex" or any word that is confusingly similar
in sound or appearance to such mark or name.

            SECTION 8.2     TAX MATTERS.  (a) LIABILITY FOR TAXES.

            (i) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to ARTICLE XI
      (and subject to the provisions thereof (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
      do not include the Cap or the Basket)) shall indemnify each Buyer Group
      Member from and against, (A) any Incremental Subpart F Taxes and (B) all
      Taxes imposed on the Purchased Entities or applicable to the Business or
      the Assets, in each case for any liability arising in any taxable year or
      period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any
      Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
      including the Closing Date including, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) any
      amounts payable by reason of the membership (or termination of membership)
      of any Purchased Entity in a consolidated or affiliated group or other
      relationship to another entity or similar arrangement prior to the Closing
      Date, whether by virtue of recapture of losses, credits, other Tax
      attributes or otherwise and (y) any amount arising out of or relating to
      the pre-closing restructuring of the Purchased Entities resident in Mexico
      described in SCHEDULE 8.2(A)(I) (the "MEXICAN RESTRUCTURING") or the
      pre-Closing removal of cash from the Purchased Entities; PROVIDED,
      HOWEVER, that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not
      indemnify any Buyer Group Member from and against, (I) any Taxes shown as
      a liability or reserve on the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, or
      (II) any Taxes that result from any actual or deemed election under
      Section 338 of the Code (other than the Non-U.S. Section 338 Elections) or
      any similar provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of the
      purchase or deemed purchase of the Securities or that result from Buyer,
      any Affiliate of Buyer, or any Purchased Entity engaging in any activity
      or transaction (other than any activity or transaction undertaken by a
      Purchased Entity on or prior to the Closing Date at the direction of
      Seller) that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
      to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of any Purchased Entity for
      federal, state or local Tax purposes (Taxes described in this proviso,
      hereinafter "EXCLUDED TAXES"). Seller shall be entitled to any refund of
      Taxes (including by reason of a reduction of Taxes to be paid) allocable
      to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and,
      with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
      ending on and including the Closing Date, except that any credits or
      offset after the Closing Date for value added, goods and services or
      similar taxes paid before the Closing


                                       71
<PAGE>

      Date and any Taxes shown as an asset or receivable on the Closing Date
      Working Capital Statement shall be for Buyer's account. For the avoidance
      of doubt, any U.S. foreign Tax credits arising under Section 902 of the
      Code with respect to dividends paid or deemed paid after the Closing Date
      by the Purchased Entities that relate to foreign income Taxes incurred
      prior to the Closing Date and that are not otherwise claimed on the Tax
      Returns of Seller or its Affiliates (after the Closing) under Section 901
      or 902 of the Code shall be for the account of Buyer, and for the further
      avoidance of doubt Buyer shall not be required to reimburse Seller for
      any foreign Tax credits claimed on its Tax Returns or its Affiliate's Tax
      Return after the Closing.

            (ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to ARTICLE XI
      (and subject to the provisions thereof (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
      do not include the Cap or the Basket)) shall indemnify each Seller Group
      Member from and against, (A) all Taxes imposed on the Purchased Entities
      or applicable to the Business or the Assets, in each case for any
      liability arising in any taxable year or period that begins after the
      Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
      Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded Taxes.
      Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall be entitled to any refund
      of Taxes (including by reason of a reduction of Taxes to be paid)
      allocable to any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
      and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
      Period beginning after the Closing Date.

            (iii) For purposes of CLAUSES (I) and (II), any Straddle Period
      shall be treated on a "closing of the books" basis as two partial periods,
      one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began
      at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
      that (A) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
      allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in
      Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date
      after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is
      deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date,
      and (B) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
      annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
      between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis. By way of
      further clarification, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed with
      respect to a Straddle Period, (1) real, personal and intangible property
      Taxes ("PROPERTY TAXES") of the Companies allocable to the period deemed
      to end on the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of such Property
      Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
      numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
      are in such period and the denominator of which is the number of days in
      the Straddle Period; and (2) the Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the
      Companies allocable to the period deemed to end on the Closing Date shall
      be computed as if such taxable period ended on and included the Closing
      Date and was therefore subject to the first sentence of this paragraph,
      provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
      an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall
      be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period
      beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
      each period. Each Company that is classified as a partnership or
      "flowthrough" entity for Tax purposes shall be treated for purposes of
      this


                                       72
<PAGE>

      Agreement as if its taxable year ended as of the close of business on
      the Closing Date and Taxes attributable to the income and gain of each
      such entity through the close of business on the Closing Date shall be
      considered to be attributable to the period deemed to end on the Closing
      Date.

            (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
      sales, use, value-added, business, goods and services, transfer,
      documentary, stock transfer conveyancing or similar Taxes or expenses that
      may be imposed as a result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement
      (including any stamp duty or other Tax chargeable in respect of any
      instrument transferring property and any Taxes (other than income Taxes)
      payable in connection with the sale and transfer of the Transferred
      Intellectual Property together with any and all penalties, interest and
      additions to Tax with respect thereto (collectively "TRANSFER TAXES"),
      shall be shared equally by the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on
      the other hand. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the Share
      Transfer Tax under article 13 par. 2 of Greek law 2238/1994 shall be
      considered a Transfer Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Recoverable
      Transfer Taxes shall be paid entirely by, shall be the responsibility of
      and shall be for the account of Buyer. "RECOVERABLE TRANSFER TAXES" means
      Transfer Taxes to the extent Buyer is entitled to recover or benefit from
      such Transfer Taxes by any means, including refund, input credit or
      reduction of its payments of Transfer Taxes. The parties shall cooperate
      in making, in a timely manner, all filings, returns, reports and forms as
      may be required to comply with the provisions of any laws relating or
      applicable to Transfer Taxes. Neither Seller nor Buyer, nor any of their
      respective Affiliates, shall take any position on any filing with any
      Governmental Body inconsistent with the terms set forth in this Agreement
      unless required to do so by applicable law.

            (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
      Taxes relating to Independent Sales Representative Liabilities shall be
      governed by SECTION 8.13.

            (b) TAX RETURNS.

            (i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due
      (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Tax Returns
      that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Purchased Entities
      on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all Mexican income Tax Returns
      relating to the Purchased Entities for periods ending on or prior to
      December 31, 2005 ("MEXICAN RETURNS"), and Seller shall timely remit or
      cause to be timely remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
      Any Tax Returns to be filed by Seller pursuant to the preceding clauses
      (A) and (B) shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practice of
      the Business and no position shall be taken, election made or method
      adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
      methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including,
      without limitation, any position which would have the effect of
      accelerating deductions to periods for which Seller or any of its
      Affiliates is liable or deferring income to periods for which Buyer is
      liable). In connection with Seller's preparation of any Mexican Returns
      due after the Closing Date, Buyer shall make available to Seller the
      services of Jesus Leal, Jesus



                                       73
<PAGE>

      Molina and Manuela Cantoral (assuming such individuals are then employed
      by Buyer or any of its Affiliates), who shall provide assistance
      consistent with past practice at the direction of Seller. Any annual
      Mexican Returns and annual material income Tax Returns described in the
      preceding CLAUSES (A) or (B) shall be submitted to Buyer not later than
      20 business days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns. Any
      monthly Mexican Return which reports the Mexican Restructuring shall be
      submitted to Buyer not later than 5 business days prior to the due date
      for filing such Tax Returns. In connection with Buyer's review of any
      annual Tax Returns which report the Mexican Restructuring, Seller shall
      provide Buyer with access to any pre-existing valuation reports, basis
      and earnings and profits studies and any other pre-existing information
      reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with its review of such Tax
      Returns. Seller shall consider in good faith any comments provided by
      Buyer, but any decision regarding the positions taken with respect to any
      taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of
      the Mexican Returns, the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
      Closing Date shall (subject to the next sentence) be at the sole
      discretion of Seller. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence (I) if
      Buyer provides Seller with a tax opinion from a law firm or accounting
      firm experienced in such matters to the effect that the position
      proposed to be adopted by Seller has no "substantial authority" (as
      defined in the Code) or, in the case of the Mexican Returns, would in
      any way impair the ability of the auditor to issue a tax compliance
      certificate (Dictamen Fiscal), then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in
      good faith to reach a mutually satisfactory position, provided that
      Seller shall have discretion to adopt any position that does have a
      substantial authority and would not impair the ability of the auditor
      to issue the tax compliance certificate, (II) Seller may not adopt a
      position that violates the second sentence hereof (requiring Tax Returns
      to be filed consistent with past practice), and (III) Seller shall not
      (except as described below) deduct any amortization on Mexican trademarks
      purchased by Probemex Consultoria, S de RL de CV as a result of the
      transactions undertaken on December 29, 2004. In the case of the Mexican
      Returns, with respect to any positions taken with respect to the portion
      of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
      approval rights, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld,
      delayed or conditioned.

            (ii) Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due
      (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns
      that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Purchased Entities
      after the Closing Date and Buyer shall remit timely or cause to be
      remitted timely any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect
      to Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence
      that relate to taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing
      Date (I) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with past
      practice of the Business and no position shall be taken, election made or
      method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made
      or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including,
      without limitation, position which would have the effect of accelerating
      income to periods for which Seller or any of its Affiliates is liable or
      deferring deductions to periods for which Buyer is liable) and (II) such
      Tax Returns shall be submitted to Seller not later than 30 business days
      prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is
      within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
      following the Closing Date) for review and approval by Seller, which
      approval may not be


                                       74
<PAGE>

      unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, but may in all cases be
      withheld if such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with CLAUSE
      (I). With respect to any Tax Return to be filed by Buyer, Buyer shall not
      deduct any amortization on Mexican trademarks purchased by Probemex
      Consultoria, S de RL de CV as a result of the transactions undertaken on
      December 29, 2004; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if in the opinion of counsel
      to the Buyer, the law with respect to such transaction is favorably
      clarified by a subsequent court action or pronouncement of the Mexican
      Tax authorities, Buyer may, following written notice to Seller of such
      development, deduct such amortization and shall cooperate with Seller in
      amending any Straddle Period Tax Return to take such deduction for the
      benefit of Seller.

            (iii) If either party disputes the basis on which a Tax Return
      subject to this SECTION 8.2(B) has been prepared, the disputing party
      shall promptly notify the other party in writing of such disputed item or
      items and the basis for the disputing party's objection. Seller and Buyer
      shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on
      which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If Seller and Buyer
      cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved
      by the Unrelated Accounting Firm as promptly as practicable, subject to
      the terms of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Unrelated
      Accounting Firm, together with any late filing penalties and any interest
      payable for late payment of Tax, shall be shared equally between Seller
      and Buyer.

            (iv) Seller or Buyer shall pay the other party for the Taxes for
      which Seller or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to SECTION 8.2(A)
      but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party
      pursuant to this SECTION 8.2(B) upon the written request of the party
      entitled to payment, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of
      the amount owed by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event
      earlier than 10 days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes, for the
      avoidance of doubt, without regard to any limitations set forth in ARTICLE
      XI. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward,
      to the party entitled pursuant to this SECTION 8.2 to a refund of Taxes,
      the amount of such refund within 20 days after such refund is received or
      applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be, in each case
      net of any costs to the party receiving such refund, it being understood
      and agreed that if such refund is as a result of a determination by a tax
      authority not ultimately available to the party originally claiming such
      refund, any amount shall be reimbursed by the other party within 10 days
      of the written request therefor.

            (v) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or
      permit any Purchased Entity to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or
      grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
      Return relating in whole or in part to any Purchased Entity with respect
      to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or
      with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of
      Seller.

            (vi) Buyer shall promptly cause each Purchased Entity to prepare and
      provide to Seller (I) in the case of any Purchased Entity for which a
      non-U.S. Section 338


                                       75
<PAGE>

      Election is made within four months following the Closing Date and (II) in
      the case of any other Purchased Entity by November 15, 2006 a package of
      Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers (the "TAX
      PACKAGE") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare and file any Tax
      Returns (including IRS Form 5471). The Tax Package shall be completed in
      accordance with past practice, including past practice as to providing
      such information.

            (c) CONTEST PROVISIONS. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
 writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any Purchased Entity of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for which
Seller may be liable pursuant to SECTION 8.2(A). Seller shall have the sole
right to represent the Purchased Entity's interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding ("TAX PROCEEDING") relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes for
which Seller may be liable pursuant to SECTION 8.2(A), and to employ counsel of
its choice at its expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) Seller shall consult with
Buyer before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding if such Tax Proceeding would adversely affect Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased Entities), and (B)
Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding, if such
action would adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Purchased Entities), without obtaining the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have the sole right
(subject to the preceding sentence) to control any Tax Proceeding relating to
the pre-Closing restructuring of the Purchased Entities resident in Mexico. In
the case of a Tax Proceeding for any Straddle Period of a Purchased Entity
(other than a Straddle Period governed by the preceding sentence), the
Controlling Party shall have the right to control such Tax Proceeding; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (A) the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-controlling Party
with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax
Proceeding; (B) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-controlling
Party before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding; (C) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-controlling
Party and offer the Non-controlling Party an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Proceeding (and will consider such comments in good faith); (D) the
Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith
as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding;
(E) the Non-controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Proceeding if such Tax Proceeding would have an adverse impact on the
Non-controlling Party or any of its Affiliates; and (F) the Controlling Party
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, of the Non-controlling Party if such
settlement, compromise or abandonment would adversely affect the Non-controlling
Party or any of its Affiliates. "CONTROLLING PARTY" shall mean whichever Selling
Entity, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, is reasonably expected to
bear the greater Tax liability in connection with a Tax Proceeding for a
Straddle Period, and "NON-CONTROLLING PARTY" shall mean whichever of Selling
Entity, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, is not the Controlling
Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding. None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates
or any Purchased Entity may settle any Tax claim for any Taxes


                                       76
<PAGE>

for which Seller may be liable pursuant to SECTION 8.2(A), without the prior
written consent of Seller.

            (d) ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to:

      other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
      SECTION 8.2(B);

            (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes
      with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Purchased Entity

      Entity or relating to the Business or the Assets;

            (iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
      threatened Tax audits or assessments of any Purchased Entity or relating
      to the Business or the Assets for taxable periods for which the other may
      have a liability under this SECTION 8.2;

            (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received
      from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information

            (f) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their applicable
Affiliates to, comply with the provisions of EXHIBIT R.

            (g) TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. Except as provided on SCHEDULE 8.2(H) or
as contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Seller shall cause the provisions of any
Tax sharing agreement between Seller and their respective Affiliates (other than
the Purchased Entities), on the one hand, and any of the Purchased Entities, on
the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date and (ii) after
the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such
Tax sharing agreements.

            SECTION 8.3 EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Effective as of the
Closing Date, (1) the employment by Seller or any of its Affiliates of the
employees of the Business other than those employed by the Purchased Entities
(the "BUSINESS ASSET EMPLOYEES," which shall be set forth on SCHEDULE 8.3(A))
shall cease; and (2) Buyer shall employ (where employment continues by operation
of Requirements of Law) or, where employment does not continue by operation of
Requirements of Law, shall offer (or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to offer)
to employ each Business Asset Employee (including any Business Asset Employee
who is on a leave of absence for any reason) as of the Closing Date, on terms
and conditions that meet the applicable Requirements of Law, other than those
that will not result in a material liability to Buyer or Seller. Each Business
Asset Employee whose employment continues by operation of Requirements of Law or
who accepts an offer of employment on or prior to the Closing (without any
rejection thereof as permitted under applicable Requirements of Law), and each
Employee of the Business employed by the Purchased Entities, shall be a
"TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE." Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for, and
shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any Losses related to
any severance, termination indemnity, redundancy or any other similar payment
incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to (1) any Business
Asset Employee who is not a "Transferred Employee", or who would be a
"Transferred Employee" but who withholds his individual consent or objects to
the transfer under applicable Requirements of Law and thus refuses to become an
employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that where the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates fails to make a proper offer of employment as
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
responsible for any such liability) and (2) any other employee of Seller or its
Affiliates who is not an Employee of the Business. The parties agree to comply
with such Requirements of Law to the extent required to transfer a Business
Asset Employee in a timely manner, including the making of a specific offer of
employment, and any required consultations, approvals, and notifications. Buyer
shall have no obligation under this Agreement to provide employment to any
Business Asset Employee who properly rejects such offer to become a Transferred
Employee. Except as otherwise provided in this SECTION 8.3, all Transferred
Employees will cease to accrue benefits under and participate as active
participants in all Employee Benefit Plans and Required Plans which are not
Assumed Plans as of the Closing Date. Any employee of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller other than a Purchased Entity who is not a Business Asset Employee and
who actively participates in any Assumed Plan shall cease such participation
effective as of the Closing Date. Seller will transfer any work permits or
passes applicable to the Transferred Employees, to the extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law and the cost of such transfer shall be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller. Within 30 days after the later of the date of this
Agreement (subject to any applicable Requirements of Law, including without
limitation any employee consent) or


                                       78
<PAGE>

the receipt of any required employee consent, Seller shall provide Buyer the
following information with respect to each Employee of the Business who has
consented to the provision of such information, such individual's (i) years of
service; (ii) job title; (iii) base salary or current wages; (iv) date of hire;
(v) employment status; and (vi) work location. To the extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law (including without limitation any employee
consents), Seller shall update the information required to be provided by the
preceding sentence and shall deliver such updated information to Buyer no later
than 15 days prior to the later of the Closing Date or the receipt of any
required employee consent.

            (b) Buyer and Seller declare that for European Employees, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be considered to constitute
the transfer of an undertaking for the purpose of Council Directive 2001/23
dated March 12, 2001 on Transfers of Undertakings and the national laws and
regulations implementing such directives in the European Union member states
(the "TRANSFER REGULATIONS"). Except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller understand and agree that any Liability, and all
related costs, of any Selling Entity for European Employees will transfer to
Buyer on the Closing Date.

            (c) Unless prohibited under applicable Requirements of Law, Transfer
Regulations or the terms of any contract, Buyer and Seller agree that the
contracts of employment of Transferred Employees and any contractual rights of
Transferred Employees will have effect from the Closing Date as if originally
made between Buyer and the Transferred Employees with positions, duties,
responsibilities, employee benefit plans, base salary, bonuses, incentive
remuneration programs, vacation pay, deferred remuneration and other terms and
conditions of employment, including those arising from collective labor
agreements, which are the same as those existing terms and conditions in effect
with Seller and any of its Affiliates on the Closing Date and for the period as
required by applicable Requirements of Law, and Buyer shall fully indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates for any actions taken by Buyer on or after the Closing
relating to such terms and conditions of employment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that,
unless required by applicable Transfer Regulations, Requirements of Law or the
relevant contracts of employment, Buyer shall not be required to continue any
such terms and conditions beyond the Closing Date. In computing the amount of
entitlement under all terms and conditions of employment as well as the
entitlement from employee benefit plans (including any severance plans), service
with both Seller (including any Affiliate of Seller) and Buyer shall be taken
into account, other than where such crediting of service would result in a
duplication of benefits and excluding any Liabilities with respect to any
defined benefit pension plans. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller understand and agree that any Liability, and all
related costs, of any Selling Entity for Other Employees will transfer to Buyer
on the Closing Date. Buyer is not assuming, and will not have liability for the
continuation of, or any liability for claims under, any Employee Benefit Plans
or Required Plans (other than the Business Plans) applicable to the Transferred
Employees, and Buyer will not be deemed a successor employer to Seller or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan or Required Plan,
except to the extent set forth in this Agreement with respect to Assumed Plans
or as required by the Requirements of Law. No plan adopted or maintained by
Buyer with respect to the Transferred Employees will be deemed a successor plan
of any plan maintained or adopted by Seller or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary hereunder, Seller


                                       79
<PAGE>

shall be solely liable for any plan, program, agreement or arrangement (if any)
implemented by Seller or its Affiliates (as such Affiliates exist on or prior to
Closing) with respect to Transferred Employees providing financial incentives to
retain such Employees relating to their service with Seller or its Affiliates
during the process of selling the Business (the "RETENTION AGREEMENTS").

            (d) Buyer and Seller shall comply with all applicable Requirements
of Law relating to employee notices, consultations and communications in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
provide each other with all information reasonably necessary for the other party
to comply with the information and consultation provisions of the Transfer
Regulations and all other applicable Requirements of Law.

            (e) With respect to any funded Assumed Plan, Seller or its
Affiliates shall cause to be transferred to the applicable Purchased Entity the
assets associated with such Assumed Plan. Where the funded Assumed Plans include
assets in respect of employees who will remain with any Affiliates of Seller,
Seller's actuaries and Buyer's actuaries will jointly determine a basis for
determining those assets, if any, which will be retained by Seller, and an
appropriate timetable, subject to Requirements of Law and applicable consents.
The payments or assignments described in this SECTION 8.3(F) will be made no
later than the later of (i) six months after the Closing Date and (ii) the date
on which such payment, transfer or assignment may be made consistent with
Requirements of Law, applicable consents, or as otherwise agreed by Seller and
Buyer. Buyer will accept the assignment of any assets and will use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the administrators or other responsible
persons of Buyer's employee benefit plans will accept such payment, transfer or
assignment. Following the transfers described above, Seller and its Affiliates
will be discharged from any further Liability (for all accrued benefits and for
the payment of all benefit payments under such plans) with respect to the
Transferred Employees and any other terminated vested participants and any
beneficiaries of such Employees or participants, and Buyer shall fully indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates relating to all such liabilities (which indemnity
shall survive indefinitely). If Seller's actuaries and Buyer's actuaries cannot
agree on a determination of amounts to be determined under this SECTION 8.3(F),
then Buyer and Seller will agree on a Third Party independent actuary to make
such determination, whose expenses will be shared equally by Buyer and Seller,
and whose determination will be final and binding on all parties. Where the
Assumed Plans are unfunded, there will be no transfer of assets pursuant to this
Agreement other than as set forth in SECTION 3.2(H), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates will have any further Liability (for all accrued benefits and the
payment of all benefits payable under such plans) with respect to Transferred
Employees, terminated vested plan participants, beneficiaries or Buyer with
respect to such Assumed Plans as of the Closing Date.

            (f) As of the Closing, Buyer will assume all Liabilities of Seller
and its Affiliates to Transferred Employees for any accrued vacation entitlement
and vacation pay entitlement to the extent such Liability is properly reflected
on the Closing Date Working Capital Statement. Seller and its Affiliates will
have no obligation to make any payment to Transferred Employees after the
Closing with respect to any such accrued vacation entitlement and vacation pay
entitlement to the extent such Liability is properly reflected on the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement.


                                       80
<PAGE>

            (g) Seller shall be responsible for making all bonus payments under
the existing bonus plans for the fiscal year ending July 2, 2005. Effective as
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all Liabilities of Seller and its
Affiliates to Transferred Employees for accrued bonuses for the fiscal year
ending July 1, 2006 and shall pay to such Transferred Employees the bonuses they
have earned under such bonus programs at the end of the bonus determination
period that includes the Closing Date. The determination regarding whether the
individual bonus criteria have been satisfied with regard to the respective
Transferred Employees shall be determined jointly by Seller and the Chief
Executive Officer of the Business, and the determination of whether the Seller
performance criteria have been satisfied shall be determined in good faith by
Seller. If applicable, within 5 business days following the date on which such
bonuses are paid to the Transferred Employees, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the excess of the actual bonus amounts paid pursuant to this
SECTION 8.3(G) over the bonus amounts included in Final Working Capital.

            (h) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or make available to
Buyer copies, to the extent applicable, of (i) the most recent regulatory
approval issued by the relevant national or provincial tax authority and most
recent annual report for each Business Plan (other than a Required Plan not
maintained by the Seller or any of its Affiliates), and (ii) copies of a form of
employment agreement or independent contractor/sales representative agreement
used by the Business in each country.

            (i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer at Closing a true and complete
list of all Key Independent Agents as of the day prior to the Closing Date.

            (j) Buyer and Seller will cooperate to effectuate the provisions of
this SECTION 8.3, including, informing and consulting with trade unions, works
councils, and employee representatives prior to the Closing Date in accordance
with, and at such time or times as shall be required under, applicable
Requirements of Law. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and consult with one
another as necessary as to the content of such information and consultation. In
addition, Seller and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
allowing Buyer access to the Employees of the Business for interviews on a
mutually convenient basis prior to the Closing Date, as well as access to their
personnel records and other related information, as reasonably requested by
Buyer to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law (including
without limitation any employee consents).

            (k) This Agreement and specifically the provisions of this SECTION
8.3 hereof shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and nothing in this Agreement or this SECTION 8.3, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.4 INSURANCE; RISK OF LOSS. (a) From the date hereof to the
Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will cooperate reasonably to develop and
implement a transition plan with respect to insurance coverage for the Purchased
Entities and the Business.


                                       81
<PAGE>

            (b) Seller will cause the Companies to keep insurance policies
currently maintained by the Companies and their Affiliates covering their
respective businesses, assets and current or former employees, as the case may
be, or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect through the
close of business on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall become solely responsible
for all insurance coverage and related risk of loss based on events occurring
after the Closing Date with respect to the Business. All proceeds of insurance
payable (in excess of any deductible, retention or self-insurance amount) in
respect of any event that occurs on or before the Closing Date, to the extent
that the proceeds are for damaged properties or assets that constitute Assets
and would otherwise be payable to Seller or its Affiliates, shall be received by
Seller and (a) to the extent the damage to the Assets or the assets of the
Purchased Entities to which the proceeds pertain has not been repaired or
restored or paid for by Seller, shall be paid over to Buyer at the Closing, or,
if no proceeds have been received before the Closing, Seller shall assign any of
its claims thereto to Buyer promptly following the Closing Date, and (b) to the
extent the damage to the Assets or the assets of the Purchased Entities to which
the proceeds pertain has been repaired or restored or paid for by Seller, shall
be retained by Seller on or prior to the Closing, or, if no proceeds have been
received before the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to all claims thereto.
Provided that Seller complies with Seller's obligations under this SECTION 8.4,
neither the occurrence of any casualty damage nor the payment, receipt or
collection of insurance proceeds shall be included or accounted for in any way
under the provisions of SECTION 3.3 or in the determination of Final Working
Capital. To the extent that after the Closing any party hereto requires any
information regarding claim data, payroll or other information in order to make
filing with insurance carriers or self insurance regulators from another party
hereto, the other party will promptly supply such information.

            SECTION 8.5 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as provided in this SECTION
8.5 whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all expenses incurred
in connection with obtaining any title commitments shall be paid by Buyer; and
PROVIDED FURTHER, that all costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, by Seller, a Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall be paid by Seller.

            SECTION 8.6     NONCOMPETE.

            (a) In furtherance of the sale of the Assets, the Purchased Entities
and the Business to Buyer hereunder by virtue of the transactions contemplated

(36) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "CONTROL PERIOD"), neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates will directly or indirectly engage in, or
invest in, own, manage, operate or control any enterprise that engages in the

nutritional products (the "PROHIBITED BUSINESS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
nothing set forth in this SECTION 8.6 shall:

            (i) restrict or prohibit Seller and its Affiliates from selling
      products directly to consumers through e-commerce websites not conducting
      the Prohibited Business; and

            (ii) prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from (A) owning not in excess

      or regional stock exchange or on the NASDAQ national market or (B)
      acquiring by virtue of merger, business combination, asset transfer or
      otherwise, and thereafter operating, the assets or a business of any Third
      Party which assets or business are similar to and/or in competition with
      the Prohibited Business so long as such business represented no more than
      fifteen percent 15% of the revenues of such Person at the time of the
      acquisition;

            (b) During the Control Period, Seller shall not license to any
enterprise that engages in the business of selling through independent sales
representatives or consultants directly to consumers in a face-to-face manner,
which may involve the use of computer interfaces between the vendor and
consumer, but without involvement directly or indirectly of a fixed retailer,
wholesaler or other broker (an "OTHER DIRECT SELLING BUSINESS"), the trademark
and trade name "Sara Lee" for use in the marketing or branding of the sales
force organization of an Other Direct Selling Business.

            (c) During the Control Period, Seller and its Affiliates shall not
sell to an Other Direct Selling Business in the jurisdictions in which the
Business is located or conducted cosmetics, fragrances and toiletries, jewelry,

            (ii) prohibit Seller and its Affiliates from affixing on the
      products in small type the "Sara Lee" corporate name and address, as
      required by law and/or as an indication of the source or the marketer of
      the product, but not as a brand.

            (d) Nothing in this SECTION 8.6 shall be deemed to limit or modify
the rights and obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates and Seller and its
Affiliates under the Ancillary Agreements, including but not limited to the
exclusive time periods granted therein.

            (e) This SECTION 8.6 shall cease to apply to any Person at such time
as it is no longer an Affiliate of Seller.

            SECTION 8.7 NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. None of Seller, any of

or representatives (acting on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates) will at any

employees through media advertisements that are not directed at Persons employed
in the Business by Buyer and its Affiliates or any successor.

            SECTION 8.8 DURATION AND SCOPE. The parties agree that the covenants
contained in SECTIONS 8.6 and 8.7 are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their
geographic scope and their duration and no party shall raise any issue of the
reasonableness of the scope or duration of the covenants in any proceeding to
enforce any such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse

remaining separate covenants to be enforced. Seller agrees that any remedy at
law for any breach of SECTION 8.6 or 8.7 would be inadequate, and Buyer would be
entitled to seek injunctive relief in such case.

            SECTION 8.9 CONFIDENTIALITY UNDERTAKINGS. Promptly following the

terms thereof, Seller shall request the return or destruction of all information
related to the Business which shall have been furnished to each such Person.
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall not amend, modify or supplement, in each case
in a manner materially adverse to Buyer's interest, or grant any consent or
waiver under or with respect to, any of such confidentiality agreements without
Buyer's prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and shall cause the same to remain in full force and
effect to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver
relates to information related to the Business.

            SECTION 8.10 NO NEGOTIATION OR SOLICITATION. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller and its Affiliates will not (and Seller will cause each of its
employees, officers, directors, representatives and agents not to) (a) solicit,
initiate, consider, entertain, encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the
making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or offer from, or enter any
agreement, letter of intent or similar document or any contract, understanding
or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to, that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a proposal or offer for, the direct or
indirect acquisition (by purchase of assets, Capital Stock, merger or otherwise)
of the Business or (except to the extent permitted by SECTION 7.4) any material
portion of the Assets, or (b) participate in any direct or indirect discussions
or negotiations (and Seller shall immediately cease any direct or indirect

Third Party to do or seek, any of the foregoing.

            SECTION 8.11 ACCESS TO RECORDS; OTHER. Subject to Buyer's
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to obtaining any
necessary consents from Third Parties (including the consent of such party's
accountants in the case of accountant's work papers), on and after the Closing
Date, each of Seller and Buyer will afford to the other and its officers,
employees, representatives and agents reasonable access to its and its
Affiliates' books of account, financial and other records (including
accountant's work papers), information, employees and auditors to the extent
necessary or useful in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or
litigation with a Third Party relating to the Business or the Assets; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any such access by Seller or Buyer shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the other party and the party
requesting access shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the
foregoing sentence; PROVIDED, FURTHER that neither party shall be required to
violate any obligation of confidentiality or any Requirement of Law to which
such party or any of its Affiliates is subject or to waive any privilege which
such party or any of its Affiliates may possess in discharging its obligations
pursuant to this SECTION 8.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
each party pursuant to this SECTION 8.11 shall be subject to the right of the
party providing access to determine, in its discretion, the appropriate timing
of the disclosure of information it deems proprietary commercial information or
privileged.

            SECTION 8.12 FURTHER ACTION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) If,
after the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer identifies: (i) any Company Intellectual
Property owned by or with respect to the Middle East for the benefit of Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller that as of the Closing Date should have been but
inadvertently was not previously transferred by any Asset Seller to Buyer or
such transfer to Buyer is subject to a required consent from a Third Party that

Asset Seller to Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary and recorded in the name of a
Buyer or such Subsidiary in a relevant jurisdiction; or (iii) any Third Party
Licenses that should have been but inadvertently was not listed on SECTION
5.11(B), then Seller (subject to SECTION 13.12 and if Buyer identifies any such
Company Intellectual Property or Third Party License more than two years after
the Closing Date, to the extent Seller has the right to do so) shall promptly
transfer or cause the transfer of such Company Intellectual Property to Buyer,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, at Seller's cost and for no additional
consideration, or take such other remedial action as may be then be necessary to
correct the failure or inaccuracy of representation or warranty, including
executing such additional documents as the Buyer may deem reasonably necessary,
which documents shall be without representation by or recourse to Seller or any
of its Affiliates. Buyer's sole remedy for any such inadvertent failure or
inaccuracy of representation or warranty shall be to take the action(s) in
accordance with this SECTION 8.12(A). Nothing herein


                                       85
<PAGE>

shall prevent a party from contesting the determination or belief of another
party that any Company Intellectual Property or Third Party License is subject
to this SECTION 8.12(A).

            (b) If, after the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer identifies any item
of Intellectual Property that should not have been but was inadvertently
transferred by any Asset Seller to Buyer, Buyer shall, subject to the terms of
this Agreement, promptly transfer or cause the transfer of such Intellectual
Property to Seller for no additional consideration if and to the extent it has
the right to do so. Seller's sole remedy for any such inadvertent transfer shall
be the transfer back of such Intellectual Property in accordance with this
SECTION 8.12(B). Nothing herein shall prevent a party from contesting the
determination or belief of another party that any Intellectual Property is
subject this SECTION 8.12(B).

            (c) If Seller, any Asset Seller or any of its or their employees or
agents is deemed under applicable Requirements of Law to retain any rights in
the Transferred Intellectual Property, Seller hereby waives and agrees not to
exercise, and will use reasonable efforts to cause its employees and agents to,
and will cause the Asset Sellers to, and cause Asset Seller to use reasonable
efforts to cause their employees and agents to, waive and agree not to exercise,
all such rights. To the extent that such waivers or agreements are deemed
unenforceable under applicable Requirements of Law, Seller hereby grants, and
will use reasonable efforts to cause its employees and agents to, and will cause
the Asset Sellers to, and cause Asset Sellers to use reasonable efforts to cause
their employees to, grant to Buyer a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable and
royalty-free license to make, have made, use, sell, reproduce, distribute,
publicly display, create derivative works of, transmit, and modify any
Transferred Intellectual Property, without identifying or seeking the consent of
Seller, the Asset Sellers or any of its or their employees or agents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller or any Asset Seller shall not be required
to expend money, incur out-of-pocket expense, commence or participate in any
litigation offer or grant an accommodation or undertake any Liability, in which
case financial or otherwise, to any Third Party in connection with the exercise
of their reasonable efforts.

            (d) No later than (i) one month after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer certificates of registration of the registered Trademarks and
(ii) a reasonable period of time after the Closing Date, but no later than 12
months after the Closing Date (unless Seller gives reasonable evidence to Buyer
that this timeframe must be extended for one or more countries), Seller shall
deliver to Buyer duly executed deeds of assignment regarding the registered
Trademarks (legalized by notary, Apostil or Consul) on behalf of the Asset
Sellers. All costs related to the execution of such deeds of assignment on
behalf of Buyer and the registration of such deeds with the relevant trademark
registrars will be borne by Buyer.

            SECTION 8.13    MEXICAN INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE
LIABILITY.

            (a) Except as provided in SECTION 8.13(B), during the period from
the Closing Date to the 60 month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "EXCLUDED
PERIOD"), the Mexican Independent Sales Representative Liability shall be a
Liability of Seller and not Buyer, an "Excluded Liability". Except as provided
in SECTION 8.13(B), from the end of the Excluded Period and thereafter, all
Mexican Independent Sales Representative Liability shall be a Liability of Buyer
and not Seller, an "Assumed Liability." For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except
as


                                       86
<PAGE>

provided in this SECTION 8.13, all Independent Sales Representative Liability
attributable to periods prior to Closing (other than the Mexican Independent
Sales Representative Liability which is governed by this SECTION 8.13) shall be
an "Excluded Liability" and (ii) all Independent Sales Representative Liability
attributable to periods after the Closing shall be a Liability of Buyer or its
applicable Subsidiary.

            (b) Notwithstanding SECTION 8.13(A), if any action, claim,
proceeding, suit, litigation or complaint is instituted or commenced during the
Excluded Period with respect to any Mexican Independent Sales Representative
Status or any Mexican Independent Sales Representative Liability, any Mexican
Independent Sales Representative Liability resulting from such action, claim,
proceeding suit, litigation or complaint shall remain an Excluded Liability
after the Excluded Period.

            (c) The following contest procedures shall be followed with respect
to any investigation, inquiry or Action relating to any Independent Sales
Representative Status or Independent Sales Representative Liability for which
Seller may be liable pursuant to this SECTION 8.13. Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after Closing, any Purchased Entity) of notice of any pending or threatened
investigation, inquiry or Action for which Seller may be liable pursuant to
SECTION 8.13. Seller shall have the right to represent and control the defense
of the Purchased Entity's and the Business's interests in any investigation,
inquiry or Action ("INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING") relating to
any Independent Sales Representative Liability for which Seller may be liable,
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each
phase of such Independent Sales Representative Proceeding; (ii) Seller shall
consult with Buyer before taking any significant action in connection with such
Independent Sales Representative Proceeding; (iii) Seller shall consult with
Buyer and offer Buyer an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Independent Sales
Representative Proceeding (and will consider such comments in good faith); (iv)
Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Independent Sales
Representative Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer
if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would adversely affect the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; and (v) Buyer may employ its own counsel at its expense
in the event of a conflict of interest between Seller and Buyer or in the event
Seller elects not to or fails to represent and control (but in any event within
30 days of notice from Buyer of such investigation, inquiry or Action) such
defense (the parties acknowledge and agree that which party would be responsible
for any Independent Sales Representative Liability will not give rise to or be
taken into consideration in determining whether a conflict of interest exists).
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any conflict of interest described
in CLAUSE V, Seller shall have the sole right to represent and control the
defense of such investigation, inquiry or Action described in this SECTION
8.13(C). Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such investigation, inquiry
or Action. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any right to compromise, settle, admit or otherwise address any
Independent Sales Representative Liability for which Seller is or may be liable.

            (d) If Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs any Mexican
Independent Sales Representative Liability, within 5 business days after written
notice from Seller of such Liability, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to 20% of such Liability;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate amount Buyer shall be required to pay
under this SECTION 8.3(D) shall not exceed $3,000,000.00.

            (e) Buyer agrees (i) to notify Seller in writing at least 20 days
(or if 20 days notice is impracticable, as soon as practicable) in advance of
taking any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any
investigation, inquiry or Action subject to SECTION 8.13(C) or any Independent
Sales Representative Liability for which Seller may be liable and (ii) to
consult with Seller (and consider Seller's views in good faith) with respect to
any actions described in CLAUSE (I) and reasonably cooperate with Seller
(including, modifying or forgoing such action) in order to avoid any such
investigation, inquiry or Action provided that Buyer shall not be required to
take or not take any action that would adversely affect Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates to incur any out-of-pocket
expense which Seller is unwilling to reimburse Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer shall have the sole right to
determine whether to take or not take any such action.

<PAGE>

      arising from similar facts and circumstances exceeds $25,000, in which
      event, subject to CLAUSES (Y) and (Z), the Seller Group Members will be

      Expenses;

            (y) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses exceeds the

            (z) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer shall not

            (b) The indemnification provided for in SECTION 11.2(A)(I) and,

Buyer in SECTION 7.11, SECTION 11.2(A)(II) (but not the indemnification provided
for under SECTIONS 11.2(A)(II) (excluding breaches of, or failures to perform,
the covenants of Buyer in SECTION 7.11) and (III), which shall survive
indefinitely) shall terminate 18 months after the Closing Date (and no claims
shall be made by any Seller Group Member under SECTION 11.2(A)(I) or SECTION
7.11 thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to:

            (i) the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
      SECTIONS 6.1 and 6.2(A), which shall survive indefinitely; and

            (ii) any Losses or Expenses of which any Seller Group Member has
      validly given a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements
      of SECTION 11.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification would
      otherwise terminate in accordance with this SECTION 11.2, as to which the
      obligation of Buyer shall continue solely with respect to the specific
      matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been
      determined pursuant to this ARTICLE XI, and Buyer shall have reimbursed
      all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and Expenses
      that are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in accordance with this
      ARTICLE XI.

            SECTION 11.3 NOTICE OF CLAIMS. Any Buyer Group Member or Seller
Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall
give promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (the "INDEMNITOR") a notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or
against a Third Party as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given
promptly after the action or suit is commenced.

            SECTION 11.4 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT. (a) In calculating any Loss or
Expense there shall be deducted any after-Tax insurance recovery in respect
thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer).
Each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to make any such insurance
recovery. Buyer and Seller agree that, for purposes of computing the amount of
any indemnification payment under this ARTICLE XI, any such


                                       93
<PAGE>

indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Adjusted
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the extent permissible under applicable
Requirements of Law (for the avoidance of doubt, if such treatment is not
permissible, such amount shall be increased to reflect any Taxes imposed
thereon). If Seller is required to indemnify a Buyer Group Member pursuant to
the provisions of SECTION 11.1, and the cost, expense or liability for which the
indemnification is sought under SECTION 11.1 has provided, or could reasonably
be expected to provide, any Buyer Group Member with a Tax benefit, the amount of
such Tax benefit (computed assuming such Buyer Group Member is subject to United
States federal income tax at the highest marginal rate applicable to
corporations and to state tax at 6%) shall reduce Seller's liability to
indemnify a Buyer Group Member under SECTION 11.1. If Buyer is required to
indemnify a Seller Group Member pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 11.2, and
the cost, expense or liability for which the indemnification is sought under
SECTION 11.2 has provided, or could reasonably be expected to provide, any
Seller Group Member with a Tax benefit, the amount of such Tax benefit (computed
assuming such Seller Group Member is subject to United States federal income tax
at the highest marginal rate applicable to corporations and to state tax at 6%)
shall reduce Buyer's liability to indemnify a Seller Group Member under SECTION
11.2.

            (b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to SECTION 11.3,
the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled
under this ARTICLE XI shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired
and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest shall accrue on such
amount from the date of the Claim Notice up to the date of receipt of payment by
such Indemnified Part at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate in
effect as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the number of days
elapsed from the date of the Claim Notice to but excluding the payment date.

            (c) Any amount paid pursuant to this SECTION 11.4 shall not be
reduced by any value added, goods and services, sales or other indirect Taxes of
any nature which, if due, shall be borne by the Indemnitor.

            SECTION 11.5 THIRD PERSON CLAIMS. (a) Any party seeking
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by any Third Party against the Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party claim within 10 days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
written notice of the Third Party claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnitor, within five business days after the Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnitor relating to the Third Party claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be physically served with a
complaint with regard to a Third Party claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within five business days after
receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor within seven business days
after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party
claim. The failure to give notice as provided in this SECTION 11.5 shall not
relieve the


                                       94
<PAGE>

Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been
materially prejudiced by such failure.

            (b) In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened or
instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of
which payment may be sought by one party hereto from the other party under the
provisions of this ARTICLE XI, the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of any such claim of which it has knowledge
which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnitor. Any notice
of a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall contain a reference to the provision of this
Agreement upon which such claim is based, the facts giving rise to an alleged
basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted against the
Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation of any legal
proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a Third Party, the Indemnitor shall
have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its option and
at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice (reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and, subject to the Settlement Limitation
(as defined below), to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any proceeding, claim or demand which relates to any loss, liability
or damage indemnified against hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified
Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at
its expense (provided that if the use of the counsel selected by the Indemnitor
would present a conflict of interest with the interests of the Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable Expenses of the Indemnified
Party's counsel). If the Indemnitor elects to undertake such defense, it shall
promptly assume and hold such Indemnified Party harmless from and against the
full amount of Losses and Expenses resulting from such Third Party claim to the
extent provided herein. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend or fails promptly (but in any event within 30 days of notice thereof) to
defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends
against or otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and
control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnified Party may settle (the "SETTLEMENT LIMITATION") any such proceeding
if the settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations
or to admit liability, culpability, failure to act or other fault or imposes
upon the other party injunctive or other equitable relief without the consent of
the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. After
any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration
board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which
to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the
Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor
notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the
Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer, certified or bank cashier's check within 30 days after the date of
such notice.

            (c) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this
SECTION 11.5 and SECTION 8.2(C), the provisions of SECTION 8.2(C) shall control
with respect to Tax contests.

            SECTION 11.6 LIMITATIONS. (a) In any case where an Indemnified Party
recovers from Third Party any amount in respect of a matter with respect to
which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this ARTICLE XI, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such matter; and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

            (b) In the event that Seller is conducting any defense against a
Third Party claim for which a Buyer Group Member has sought indemnification
pursuant to SECTION 11.1(A), expenses incurred by Seller in connection
therewith, including legal costs and expenses, shall constitute Expenses for
purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to be paid by Seller
pursuant to SECTION 11.1(A). In the event that Buyer is conducting any defense
against a Third Party claim for which a Seller Group Member has sought
indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11.2(A), expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection therewith, including legal costs and expenses, shall constitute
Expenses for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to be paid by
Seller pursuant to SECTION 11.2(A).

            (c) No Indemnitor will be liable under this ARTICLE XI for any
Losses or Expenses relating to any matter to the extent that such matter
directly resulted in an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to ARTICLE
III.

            (d) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFITS), EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OR ARISING UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY AGREEMENT
OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE INDEMNIFIED
PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

            (e) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance) or instances
of fraud, if the Closing occurs, this ARTICLE XI shall be the exclusive remedy
of Buyer for breaches of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of the
Assets and Securities contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                                   TERMINATION

            SECTION 12.1 TERMINATION. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:


                                       96
<PAGE>

            (a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

            (b) by Seller upon 15 business days' notice if any of the conditions
in ARTICLE X shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the Closing (provided
that the inability to fulfill the conditions in ARTICLE X shall not have been
caused by or resulted from the failure of Seller to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or a breach of any representation or warranty
by Seller in this Agreement) and shall not have been waived in writing by
Seller;

            (c) by Buyer upon 15 business days' notice if any of the conditions
in ARTICLE IX shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the Closing
(provided that the inability to fulfill the conditions in ARTICLE IX shall not
have been caused by or resulted from the failure of Buyer to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or a breach of any representation or warranty
of Buyer in this Agreement) and shall not have been waived in writing by Buyer;

            (d) by Buyer or Seller if any court or other Governmental Body
having jurisdiction over Buyer or Seller shall have issued a final and
non-appealable order, decree, judgment or ruling permanently restraining,
preventing, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the purchase and sale of any
material portion of the Assets or the Securities; or

            (e) by Buyer or Seller on the second business day following the
Termination Date (as defined below) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before February 28, 2006 (or such later date as may be agreed to in writing to
Buyer and Seller (as may be extended pursuant to the immediately following
proviso, the "TERMINATION DATE")); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that either party may by
written notice to the other party delivered on or before February 28, 2006
extend such date until April 30, 2006 if the failure of the Closing to have
occurred on or before February 28, 2006 shall have resulted from the failure of
the condition set forth in SECTIONS 9.1 and 10.1; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 12.1(E) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations contained
in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to have occurred on or prior to the aforesaid dates.

            SECTION 12.2 NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 12.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party to this Agreement.

            SECTION 12.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this ARTICLE XII, all further obligations of the parties (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent or representative of either
party) under this Agreement (other than this SECTION 12.3, SECTION 8.6, and
ARTICLE XIII, which provisions shall each survive such termination) shall
terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this SECTION 12.3 shall relieve
any party from any liability for a willful breach of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 13.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing only for the period during which an indemnification claim is permitted
to be made pursuant to ARTICLE XI, after which time such representations and
warranties shall terminate and the parties shall have no rights or remedies
thereafter with respect to any breach of such representations or warranties.

            SECTION 13.2 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of Delaware.
Seller and Buyer irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the
courts of the State of Delaware sitting in New Castle County and (b) the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, for the purposes of any
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction or agreement
contemplated hereby. Seller and Buyer agree to commence any such proceeding
either in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or if
such proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in
the courts of the State of Delaware sitting in New Castle County. Seller and
Buyer irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue
of any proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in the courts specified above and hereby and thereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

            SECTION 13.3 NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall,
without the approval of the other, make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by law or any
listing agreement of any party hereto with any national or foreign securities
exchange, in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued prior to making any such press release or public
statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not preclude (a)
communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this
Agreement or to comply with SEC disclosure obligations or the rules of any
United States or foreign stock exchange or (b) a press release in the form of
EXHIBIT T issued by either party announcing the execution of this Agreement or a
press release by either party (after consultation with the other party)
announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

            SECTION 13.4 NOTICES. All notices or other communications required
or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by
facsimile or sent by private courier or by registered or certified mail, and

            SECTION 13.5 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The rights of either party
under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes
of effecting this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the parties acknowledge and
agree that Buyer may, in its sole discretion, substitute one or more of its

title and interest in all payments and other amounts that may be payable or due

liability whatsoever to any Person; PROVIDED FURTHER that none of Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries shall assign its rights under any of the Trademark and Trade
Name License Agreements without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Buyer and
Seller respectively, absolutely and unconditionally guaranty the full and timely
performance and discharge by each of their respective Subsidiaries of such
Subsidiary's obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be absolutely and unconditionally
liable to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to the extent that any Subsidiary
of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, fails to fully and timely pay and
perform or discharge any obligation under the terms hereof or any obligation
under any Ancillary Agreement (in each case without requirement that any demand,
right, action or remedy be made, initiated, pursued or obtained against such
Subsidiary or enforced against such Subsidiary).

            (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and successors and assigns
permitted by this SECTION 13.5 any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

            SECTION 13.6 ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER CLOSING. (a) For a period of
six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Purchased Entities, the
Assets and the Business to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the
operations of the Purchased Entities, the Assets or the Business prior to the
Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours. Seller shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this SECTION
13.6(A). If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior
to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Seller's expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Seller may select.

            (b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date or for such
longer period as is required by SECTION 8.2, Buyer and its representatives shall
have reasonable access to all of the books and records relating to the Purchased
Entities or the Business which Seller or any of its Affiliates may retain after
the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Seller and its Affiliates
upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.
Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this SECTION 13.6(B). If Seller or any of its Affiliates shall
desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of
such six-year period, Seller shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyer a


                                      100
<PAGE>

reasonable opportunity, at Buyer's expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as Buyer may select.

            SECTION 13.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement, the
annexes, the exhibits and schedules referred to herein, the Ancillary
Agreements, the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to
the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended,
modified, whether written or oral, or supplemented except by a written
instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.

            SECTION 13.8 INTERPRETATION. Articles, titles and headings to
sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The annexes, exhibits and schedules referred to herein shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as
if they were set forth verbatim herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
schedule hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any other section in this
Agreement if it is reasonably apparent from the disclosure that the disclosure
should apply to such other section in this Agreement. Neither the specification
of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any schedule hereto is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so
included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the
fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not described herein or included in any schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in any schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion
of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
any schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of
this Agreement.

            SECTION 13.9 WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

            SECTION 13.10 PARTIAL INVALIDITY. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case


                                      101
<PAGE>

any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision
shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

            SECTION 13.11 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer.

            SECTION 13.12 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time following the
Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer
may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to more effectively
convey and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any
part of the Assets; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that SECTION 2.3 shall govern with
respect to consents, approvals, waivers, agreements and actions required in
connection with the transfer of instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements
and arrangements. From time to time following the Closing, Buyer shall execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller such other
instruments of assumption as Seller may reasonably request or as may be
otherwise necessary to evidence the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed
Liabilities; provided, however, that SECTION 2.3 shall govern with respect to
consents, approvals, waivers, agreements and actions required in connection with
the transfer of instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements and
arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the transfer to
Buyer of any Company Intellectual Property, Seller's obligations under SECTION
8.12(A) and this SECTION 13.12 shall cease four years following the Closing
Date.

            SECTION 13.13 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Seller makes no
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information made available or provided to Buyer. There is no
assurance that any projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS
TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.4(B),
SELLER IS SELLING THE SECURITIES, THE ASSETS OF THE PURCHASED ENTITIES AND THE
ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE
MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE SELLER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY AS TO FITNESS, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

            SECTION 13.14 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is


                                      102
<PAGE>

accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

            SECTION 13.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.15.

            SECTION 13.16 BULK SALES LAWS. Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Seller, the Selling Entities and the Companies with the provisions of the "bulk
sales," "bulk transfer" or similar laws of any jurisdiction.


                                      103

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be executed as of the day and year first above written.
