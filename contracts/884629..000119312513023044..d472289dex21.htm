after market authorisation (or other appropriate regulatory approval legally
required for Launch), or, in the case of markets where obtaining favorable or
acceptable to the Purchaser (acting reasonably) (as compared to comparable
products, if any) pricing or reimbursement approval is a critical component of
Launch and occurs after market authorisation, within 4 calendar months after
such favourable pricing or reimbursement approval is obtained for
such Product, in the USA or in the relevant European Union Member State
respectively, provided that there is no lawful impediment to such Launch or
circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the Purchaser preventing such

not been able to secure an appropriate supply chain guaranteeing quantities of
Product sufficient for Launch and a reasonable period thereafter, despite
having used Commercially Reasonable Efforts to secure such supply chain) and
where there is such an impediment or circumstance, the period shall be
extended to 4 calendar months from the date of its removal or ceasing to
apply and the applicable Milestone Date(s) shall be extended by a period equal
to the period of such extension. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this

Product.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If, during the term of this Agreement, the Purchasers Group
receives amounts from the sale of Diafert or Estelle to a given customer other
than on an arms length basis, Net Sales shall be calculated as if such sales
had been made on an arms length basis.

     | (e) | Notwithstanding the generality of Article 5.3(a) above, the
Purchaser undertakes and shall cause each member of the Purchasers Group,

prospective, interventional clinical investigation with respect to Diafert or
the relevant Diafert Derivative Product, on the basis of the Protocol _,_ as

     | (B) | Use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to initiate the Phase
III Clinical Trials for Estelle or any Estelle Derivative Product and commence
enrolment of patients into such trial in accordance with the advice issued by
the appropriate regulatory authorities in the US and the European Union,
before 31 December 2014. 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | Obtain from an independent patent attorney of at least
twenty (20) years experience selected in accordance with Article 5.1(d)(i) a
freedom to operate report for the manufacturing process used for estetrol to
manufacture the batches of Estelle or any Estelle Derivative Product referred
to in that Article, before 31 December 2016. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (D) | Use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to enter into a suitable
development contract with PCAS SA in respect of Estelle if the Purchaser,
acting reasonably, is satisfied that the PCAS Process is likely to meet all
of the applicable requirements described in Article 5.1(d) above and there is
no superior or equivalent alternative. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | The Purchaser shall ensure that, and shall cause the
Companies, the (Sub)Licensees and Distributors to ensure that, any agreement
that is concluded with any Person (including the Companies, (Sub)Licensee and
Distributors) which grants rights to commercialise any of the Products or any
Derivative Product while the Milestone Payment with respect to such Products
or relevant Derivative Product are payable, includes an undertaking by which
the Purchaser shall be periodically informed of the Net Sales generated under
such agreement by such Person, and which shall provide in the necessary audit
mechanisms to verify such Net Sales.  
---|---|--- 



   5.4 | Non-Compliance and Cure 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If the Sellers Representatives, acting reasonably and in
good faith, believe that the Purchaser for a consecutive period of six
calendar months or more, ceased to Develop a Product (or a Derivative Product
thereof) with a view to achieving the Milestones or has ceased commercialising
it with a view to achieving the Milestones, other than where the Development
or commercialisation has ceased or been suspended for any regulatory reason,
or has failed to comply with any of the undertakings in Articles 5.1(d),
5.3(a), 5.3(b) or 5.3(e) they may notify the Purchaser thereof setting out in
reasonable details the obligations with which the Sellers Representatives
believe the Purchaser has failed to comply and the specific reasons why they
believe there has been such a failure and what steps (if any) they believe
would be required to be taken over a period of three calendar months to cure
the breach (a "Non-Compliance Notice") provided that where: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Sellers Representatives belief is based upon matters
fairly disclosed to them in two successive Progress Reports or other
information supplied to them over a course of twelve (12) calendar months in
sufficient detail to enable the Sellers Representatives to assess the past
activities or future plans of relevant members of the Purchasers Group to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to commercialise or Develop the Products; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in the case of future plans, the relevant member(s) of the
Purchasers Group implemented such plans materially in the manner disclosed, 
---|---|--- 
 



50 _Private and confidential_

 



the Sellers Representatives may not serve a Non-Compliance Notice on the
Purchaser alleging that the activities or plans as so disclosed and
implemented constitute failure by the relevant member of the Purchasers Group
to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to commercialise or Develop the
Products unless they have objected within six (6) calendar months of the first
such disclosure of such activities or plans. Nothing in this Article 5.4(a)
shall prevent the Sellers Representatives from serving a Non-Compliance
Notice where there has been fraud, misrepresentation or deliberate
concealment of information in relation to the use of such Commercially
Reasonable Efforts. Upon service of a Non-Compliance Notice, the Sellers
Representatives and the Purchaser shall make reasonable efforts to reach an
agreement on the steps that would be required to cure the breach complained of
in the Non Compliance Notice. If the Sellers Representatives and the
Purchaser fail to reach an agreement at the end of a period of thirty (30)
Business Days after receipt of the aforementioned notice, then any points of
disagreement shall be referred to the Pharmaceuticals Expert further to an
application by either the Sellers Representatives or the Purchaser,
who shall determine such matter in accordance with Article 5.8.



     | (b) | If the Sellers Representatives have served a Non-Compliance
Notice and the parties have agreed under Article 5.4 that the breach in
question is capable of remedy within a period of three (3) calendar months by
following the steps agreed upon by the parties then, the Purchaser may elect
to serve a notice on the Sellers Representatives notifying them that
Purchaser is electing to remedy the matter in question in accordance with the
agreed plan (a "Cure Notice") in which case: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Purchaser shall be entitled to attempt to remedy the
matter in question within a three calendar month period following the date of
this Cure Notice (or such shorter period that the Purchaser may elect) (the
"Cure Period") in accordance with the agreed plan; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any referral to the Pharmaceutical Expert shall be
suspended for the Cure Period; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the dates by which the relevant Milestone Payments must be
achieved shall be extended by the length of the Cure Period; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | if a Pharmaceutical Expert has been instructed, the
Purchaser shall pay the costs and expenses of the Pharmaceutical Expert
incurred up to and including the date of the Cure Notice. 
---|---|--- 



   5.5 | Ceasing to develop a Product and consequences of failure to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers Representatives in
writing if: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | for a consecutive period of six calendar months or more,
(where the relevant Product or Derivative Product has not been Launched) the
Purchasers Group ceases the Development of a Product (or a Derivative
Product thereof) (other than where the Development has ceased or been
suspended for any regulatory or legal reason); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | for a consecutive period of six calendar months or more,
(where the relevant Product or Derivative Product has been Launched) the
Purchasers Group ceases the marketing and sale of a Product (or a Derivative
Product thereof) other than for a regulatory or legal reason or shortage of
supply, 
---|---|--- 
 



51 _Private and confidential_

 



in either case, before the relevant Milestones related to the Development or
sale of that Product (or Derivative Product thereof) have been achieved.



     | (b) | If at any point in time either: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Purchaser notifies the Sellers Representatives or the
Purchaser and the Sellers Representatives agree that either of the events
referred to in Article 5.5(a) has occurred; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Pharmaceuticals Expert makes a determination pursuant
to Article 5.8 that the Purchaser has failed to comply with its obligations in
Article 5.3(a), 5.3(b) or 5.3(e), 
---|---|--- 

then, at the sole discretion of the Purchaser as notified to the Sellers
Representatives in writing within forty five (45) days after such point in
time (and subject to Articles 5.5(c), 5.5(d) and 5.7), either:



     | (iii) | the relevant Milestone(s) that have not been achieved
relating to such Product (or Derivative Product) shall be deemed to have been
achieved and the relevant Milestone Payment will be due (less any applicable
Offset Amount), or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with all relevant
information relating to such Product (or Derivative Product) within its
possession and which it may lawfully disclose (to which information the
provisions of Article 20, Confidentiality, shall apply provided that the
Seller may disclose such information to third parties with the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall offer,
or shall procure that the relevant member(s) of Purchasers Group shall offer,
to sell the Intellectual Property rights, Know how, rights in clinical data
and regulatory approvals relating to the Product (or Derivative Product)
in question (such offer being open for not less than 90 days (the "Offer
Period")) to an entity nominated by the Sellers Representatives ("Nominated
Entity"), on behalf of the Sellers (save in circumstances where the Product
in question is subject to any restrictions on transfer or subject to any other
obligations of the Group, whether to any government or other authorities under
the terms of any grants received by the Group or otherwise, in which
case subsection (i) of this Article shall apply and subject to Article 5.7).
The price (the "Product Disposal Price") at which the Purchaser shall sell the
Intellectual Property Rights in the Product (or Derivative Product)
in question shall be the aggregate of: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the amount of any and all external development costs
incurred by the Purchasers Group in respect of such Product (or Derivative
Product) since Closing;  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the amount of any and all costs of defending any
infringement claims incurred by the Purchasers Group in respect of such
Product (or Derivative Product) since Closing, save to the extent such costs
have already been recovered in the defence of the claim, save the costs of
defending such claims which result from the Purchaser utilising Intellectual
Property created after Closing which is not the natural result of Development
of Intellectual Property existing at Closing Date, 
---|---|--- 
 



52 _Private and confidential_

 



provided that if no such notice is given with the above forty-five (45) day
period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected for (ii) (the Product
disposal) and not (iii) (the payment of Milestones) to apply.

The Nominated Entity may elect to accept the offer and to pay the Product
Disposal Price in one upfront payment or in two instalments. If the Nominated
Entity elects to pay 100% of the Product Disposal Price upfront, the
Intellectual Property rights, Know How, rights in clinical data and regulatory
approvals relating to the Product (or Derivative Product) in question shall be
automatically assigned to the Nominated Entity upon receipt of such payment.
Alternatively, the Nominated Entity may elect to pay 10% of the Product
Disposal Price upfront within ten (10) days of its election to accept the
above offer and have an option to pay the remaining balance within
twelve (12) calendar months of such election, in which case the Nominated
Entity shall have an exclusive licence to use the Intellectual Property
rights, Know How, rights in clinical data and regulatory approvals relating to
the Product (or Derivative Product) until the time for payment of the
remaining balance falls due. If the Nominated Entity elects not to pay the
full balance by the above due date, no further payment shall be due and the
exclusive licence under this Article shall automatically terminate with
immediate effect.



     | (c) | If the Sellers Representatives elect to purchase the
Product or Derivative Product in question (or cause it to be purchased by
another entity) pursuant to this Article 5.5(b)(iv) within the Offer Period,
and fail to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Develop (if applicable) and
commercialise the Product or Derivative Product concerned in accordance with
any steps previously set out by a Pharmaceuticals Expert or as subsequently
determined by a Pharmaceuticals Expert (for which purposes, all relevant
provisions relating to such determination as set out in this Agreement shall
apply, _mutatis mutandis),_ then to the extent that the Purchaser has
previously paid any Milestone Payment to the Sellers in respect of the Product
or Derivative Product concerned, such amount shall be repaid to the Purchaser
on demand unless the Sellers elect within ten (10) Business Days not to repay
such amount in which case its licence shall be terminated with immediate
effect or it shall immediately reassign all Intellectual Property rights, Know
How, rights in clinical data and regulatory approvals relating to the Product
(or Derivative Product) to the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If the Sellers Representatives do not elect to purchase the
Product or Derivative Product in question (or do not cause it to be purchased
by another entity) pursuant to this Article 5.5(b)(iv) within the Offer
Period, the Purchaser shall not be obliged to transfer the Product or
Derivative Product in question under this Article 5.5(b)(iv) or accelerate the
payment of the Milestone Payments under Article 5.5(b)(iii) as a result of
the relevant breach. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The Purchaser or the Sellers Representatives shall require
the Pharmaceutical Expert to set out the reasons for its determination and, at
the request of either the Purchaser or the Sellers Representatives, to set
out the actions to be taken by the Purchaser to remedy any breach in respect
of the Development or commercialisation concerned and the time in which or for
which such actions should be taken to effect such remedy. The Purchaser may
elect in writing within the period of forty five (45) days in Article 5.5(b)
above, in addition to its rights in Article 5.5(b) above, to attempt to remedy
the breaches in accordance with the determination by the Pharmaceutical
Expert.

   5.6 | Subsequent Acquirers 
---|--- 

If the consummation of a transaction occurs prior to the completion of all
Milestones pursuant to which a third party that is not a member of the
Purchasers Group (a "Subsequent Acquirer") acquires any Product or
Derivative Product or the exclusive rights in material Intellectual Property
relating thereto directly or indirectly from the relevant member of the
Purchasers Group, (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by acquiring the
relevant member of the Purchasers Group that owns the Product or Derivative
Product or the exclusive rights in material Intellectual Property relating
thereto) then, at the Purchasers option, either:

 



     | (a) | the Purchaser shall cause the Subsequent Acquirer to assume
the Purchasers obligations set forth in this Article 5, in respect of the
Milestones that have not then been completed in respect of the Products that
have been so acquired, minus applicable Offset Amounts, if any, including the
obligations in this Article 5.5 (other than Article 5.7) and if the Purchaser
provides reasonable evidence that the Subsequent Acquirer has sufficient
financial standing to meet the obligations to pay any unpaid Milestone
Payments and provides binding documentation by which the Subsequent Acquirer
assumes such obligations on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers
Representatives, the Purchaser and the Purchaser Guarantor shall automatically
cease to have any further obligations in respect of the Milestones; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Purchaser shall remain liable for payment, on
achievement of the relevant Milestone(s), for the applicable Milestone
Payments (less any applicable Offset Amount).  
---|---|--- 



   5.7 | General provisions relating to Articles 5.5 and 5.6 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall not be required to comply with its obligations in Articles
5.5(b) or 5.6 to pay unpaid Milestones in circumstances where the amount of
outstanding Offset Amounts exceeds the amount of the Milestone Payment in
question. The Purchaser shall further not be required to transfer the rights
to the Product in question if there is any outstanding Offset Payment provided
that in such circumstances the Purchaser may elect to transfer the rights to
the Product in satisfaction of its obligations under Article 5.5(b) at the
cost of the Sellers (such costs when paid by the Sellers being offset against
the Offset Payment).

 



   5.8 | Pharmaceuticals Expert 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If appointed pursuant to Articles 5.2(c), 5.4(a) or 5.5(e),
the Pharmaceuticals Expert shall determine the achievement of the Milestone if
such is disputed by the Purchaser and/or the amount of the Milestone Payment
if such is a variable amount, or whether the Purchasers Group has been using
Commercially Reasonable Efforts (as the case may be, and the matter being
disputed shall be the "Matter in Dispute") and, for this purpose, shall act
on the following basis: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Pharmaceuticals Expert shall act as an expert, not an
arbitrator; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Pharmaceuticals Experts terms of appointment shall be
restricted to settling the matters in dispute between the Purchaser and the
Sellers Representatives which are relevant to determine the Matter in
Dispute and the Sellers Representatives will provide the Pharmaceuticals
Expert with security for costs of the Pharmaceuticals Expert if required by
the Pharmaceuticals Expert to accept the appointment; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

unless the Sellers Representatives and the Purchaser agree otherwise, the
Pharmaceuticals Expert shall, in its reasonable discretion, determine its own
procedure and working methods, including, to the extent the Pharmaceuticals 

---|---|--- 
 



54 _Private and confidential_

 



     |  Expert considers necessary, instructing professional advisers to
assist in reaching its decision, notwithstanding the fact that the procedure
shall be conducted in English;  
---|--- 



     | (iv) | the Pharmaceuticals Expert shall be asked to determine the
Matter in Dispute no later than thirty (30) Business Days from receipt of all
necessary information from the Purchaser and the Sellers Representatives;
the Pharmaceuticals Expert shall give the Purchaser and the Sellers
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to submit written and oral comments,
require the Purchaser and the Sellers Representatives to supply one another
with copies of any written comments made (together with copies of all
supporting information), and allow each of them to be present during oral
submissions by the other; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | the Pharmaceuticals Experts decision shall be reasoned but,
in the absence of fraud or manifest error, is final and binding on the

Escrow Account and in respect of any Offset Amounts. Any payments released to
the Purchaser from the Escrow Account or by way of set-off of an Offset Amount
in satisfaction of a Claim shall be borne by each Seller in the same
proportion as the Sellers proportionate interest of the Initial Purchase
Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Without prejudice to its rights to bring or recover in full
any Warranty Claim, the Purchaser agrees that if it becomes actually aware of
a matter or circumstances that in its reasonable opinion it believes will
give rise to a Warranty Claim that will be recoverable under this Agreement
and in respect of which it reasonably expects to make such a Warranty Claim,
it will notify the Sellers Representatives as soon as reasonably
practicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | In respect of Claims that are not capable of satisfaction
from the Escrow Account or by way of deduction from a Milestone Payment, the
Majority Sellers shall be:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | severally liable for Claims arising out of the Sellers
Warranties in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of _Exhibit 12_ where the Seller is a
natural person and, where the Seller is a corporate body, paragraphs 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3 of _Exhibit 12;_ and

   14.2 | Provisions, changes in legislation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Without prejudice to Article 12, the Sellers shall have no
obligation to pay any Compensation to the Purchaser in respect of any Warranty
Claim if and to the extent that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the subject matter of the relevant Warranty Claim results
from an amendment to applicable laws or regulations that enter into effect
after the date of this Agreement, regardless of whether the change has
retroactive effect or a new interpretation of an existing law by an Authority
or a change to an Authoritys method of applying or calculating Tax in a
decision generally and formally published after the date of this Agreement;
and/or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the subject matter of the relevant Warranty Claim would not
have arisen had it not been for a voluntary act or omission on the Purchasers
Groups (other than as instigated by any of the Sellers or their Affiliates)
part after Closing which could reasonably have been avoided and which the
Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchasers Group) could reasonably be
expected to be aware would give rise to a Warranty Claim. This limitation on
the Sellers liability shall not apply for any disclosures that the Purchaser
is required to make to any tax authorities or any other Authorities. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

No Warranty Claim shall be due or payable by the Sellers if the Warranty Claim
is based upon a liability which is contingent only unless and until
the contingent liability becomes 

---|---|--- 
 



76 _Private and confidential_

 



     |  actual or due and payable. This is without prejudice to the right
of the Purchaser to give notice of the Warranty Claim in accordance with
Article 14.3(a) and to issue and serve proceedings in respect of it whilst it
remains contingent. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the liability
may not have become actual or due and payable by the relevant date provided in
Article 14.3(a) shall not exonerate the Sellers in respect of any applicable
claim properly notified before that date. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall not be
prevented from bringing, or recovering in full a Warranty Claim by virtue of
any action any of the Companies carries out in the ordinary course of
business of the Business, to comply with law, to protect the legitimate
business interests of the Group or to comply with any obligations incurred by
the Purchaser under this Agreement or by any Company under any contract
entered into on or prior to Closing.

Sellers shall be liable for the whole amount and not merely the excess.



     | (iv) | Individual threshold 
---|---|--- 

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to any Compensation for a Warranty Claim
unless the amount of Compensation resulting from the breach exceeds USD

events or circumstances shall be aggregated and form a single Warranty Claim.

Claim is made in circumstances where a Milestone Payment is due for payment
and, but for the operation of this Article or Article 17.8(c), such Claim
would not be payable due to the time periods in Article 14.3(a) or Article
17.8(c) having expired or the maximum liability of the Sellers in Article
14.3(b)(i) or Article 17.3(b)(ii) having been exceeded, then the Purchaser
shall be entitled to make such Claim providing that the only recourse
in respect of such a Claim is the set-off of an Offset Amount against the
Milestone Payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 15\. 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | To the extent that any Claim is finally determined and
Compensation is due to the Purchaser, but such Claim is at any time not
satisfied in full, the Purchaser may set off any unsatisfied amounts against
any future Milestone Payment as an Offset Amount and the provisions of Article
15 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

---|--- 



     | (a) | Counsel shall be jointly instructed by the Sellers Counsel
and the Purchasers Solicitors to determine within 20 Business Days of his

probabilities be successfully determined in the Purchasers favour and, if so,
the Purchasers Estimate in respect of the Claim is a reasonable estimate of

as appropriate and Counsels fees shall be borne by the Sellers; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Claim would on the balance of probabilities be

Estimate is greater than Counsels reasonable estimate of the likely quantum
of such Claim (the "Counsels Estimate"), the Counsels Estimate shall remain
in the Escrow Account and be dealt with in accordance with Articles 6.3 and
6.4 as appropriate and the Purchaser and the Sellers Representatives shall
as soon as practical and in any case no later than five Business Days instruct
the Escrow Agents to pay the difference between the Purchasers Estimate and
the Counsels Estimate to the Nominated Account and Counsels fees shall be
borne by the Sellers and the Purchaser in the respective proportions which
Counsels Estimate bears to the Purchasers Estimate; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the Claim would not on the balance of probabilities be
successfully determined in favour of the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the
Sellers Representatives shall as soon as practical and in any case no later
than five Business Days instruct the Escrow Agents to pay an amount equal to
the Purchasers Estimate to the Nominated Account and Counsels fees shall be
borne by the Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 
 



81 _Private and confidential_

 





   16.3 | Counsel shall act as expert and not as arbitrator and his
decision as to whether or not (a) the relevant Claim would or would not on the
balance of probabilities be successfully determined in favour of the
Purchaser, and (b) whether the Purchasers Estimate is a reasonable estimate
of the likely quantum of such Claim, shall (in absence of manifest error) be
final and binding on the Purchaser.  
---|--- 



   16.4 | Any determination by Counsel under this Article 16 shall not
affect the Purchasers right to bring a claim against the Sellers (or relevant
Seller(s)) and the determination by Counsel under this Article shall be

continue unless and until the Sellers Representatives on behalf of the
Sellers or the Sellers appoint a different process agent to act on their
