Section 2.10 **_Determination of Final Merger Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) _Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative the Closing Balance
Sheet together with a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail (i) the Parents determination of the actual amounts of
Adjusted Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents and Closing Indebtedness
derived therefrom and (ii) a calculation of the Adjustment Amount and the
Merger Consideration based on such amounts, in each case, as of 11:59 pm New
York time on the Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Statement
and the calculations and determinations contained thereon shall be prepared in
accordance with _Section 2.10(e)_. Parent and the Seller Representative shall
provide to each other such data and information (including financial records
and work papers) as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation and review of the Closing Statement and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to allow for its employees to reasonably assist the Seller
Representative in reviewing the Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Disagreement_. The Closing Statement shall become final and
binding upon the Parties on the date (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is
thirty (30) days following receipt thereof by the Seller Representative unless
the Seller Representative gives written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to Parent prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any
disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Parent in
a timely manner, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
_Section 2.10(c)_, if applicable) shall become final and binding on the
Parties on, and the Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the
date upon which the Seller Representative and Parent agree in writing with
respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the
date upon which the Final Closing Statement is issued by the Accounting
Expert. Any amount, determination or calculation

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the Closing Statement and not specifically disputed in a timely
delivered Notice of Disagreement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties.

 



 

(c) _Final Closing Statement_. If Parent timely receives a Notice of
Disagreement, the Seller Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith
to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement (and all discussions related thereto
shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Parent and the Seller Representative, be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable
similar state rule)), but if they do not reach a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, the Seller
Representative and the Parent shall submit such dispute to the New York office
of Grant Thornton LLP, or any other nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants in the United States as may be mutually selected
by Parent and the Seller Representative (the " _Accounting Expert_ "). The
Seller Representative and the Parent shall cooperate in good faith to promptly
jointly engage the Accounting Expert, pursuant to an engagement letter that
requires the Accounting Expert to make all determinations in accordance with
the definitions and terms contained herein, including _Section 2.10(e)_,
notwithstanding the availability of other accounting methods, policies,
practices and/or procedures under GAAP or otherwise. If any dispute is
submitted to the Accounting Expert, each Party will promptly upon request,
furnish to the Accounting Expert such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Accounting Expert may
request and are available to that Party or its independent accountants
(including information of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and otherwise
cooperate fully with the Accounting Experts review of the dispute, and each
Party shall be afforded the opportunity to present the Accounting Expert (with
a copy concurrently delivered to the other Party) material relating to the
determination and to discuss the determination with the Accounting Expert. The
Accounting Expert (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) shall resolve
only those matters set forth in such Notice of Disagreement that remain in
dispute after the 30-day resolution period and no new dispute items shall be
introduced for consideration. With respect to any disputed item, the
Accounting Experts determination shall be no greater than the higher amount
calculated by the Parent or Seller Representative, as the case may be, and no
less than the lower amount calculated by the Parent or the Seller
Representative, as the case may be. It is the intent of the Parties that the
process set forth in this _Section 2.10(c)_ and the activities of the
Accounting Expert in connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact,
are not arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules shall be followed
(including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The Seller
Representative and the Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Expert to resolve all such disagreements as soon as
practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after submission of the
disputed issues to the Accounting Expert. The resolution of the dispute by the
Accounting Expert shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties
hereto. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be
allocated to be paid by the Parent, on the one hand, and/or the Sellers, on
the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by
such Party, as determined by the Accounting Expert. As used in this Agreement,
the term " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall mean the Closing Statement
described in _Section 2.10(a)_, as prepared by Parent and, if applicable, as
subsequently adjusted to reflect any subsequent written agreement between the
Parties with respect thereto, or if submitted to the Accounting Expert, the
Closing Statement issued by the Accounting Expert.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Final Settlement and Adjustment to Merger Consideration; Payment_.

_Section 2.11_, an amount equal to such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date on

Representative and Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Payment Agent for

Capital Escrow Funds by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Merger Consideration
is finally determined.

Consideration, then the Seller Representative and Parent shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Sellers in accordance
with _Section 2.11_, all Working Capital Escrow Funds, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date on
which the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined.

 



 

(iii) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then the Seller Representative and Parent shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to (x)
disburse to the Parent (or its designee) a portion of the Working Capital
Escrow Funds equal to such shortfall, and (y) release to the Payment Agent for
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.11_, all remaining
Working Capital Escrow Funds, in each case, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the
Final Merger Consideration is finally determined; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Working Capital Escrow Funds are insufficient to cover such
shortfall, the joint written instructions shall also instruct the Escrow Agent
to disburse a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the shortfall from
the Working Capital Escrow.

 



 

(e) _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated
Closing Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement and all
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared,
determined and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company Group in
accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (including
classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and
estimation methodologies) used and applied consistently with past practice by
the Company Group and in the preparation of the Company Groups audited
balance sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date, except that such statements,
calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase accounting
or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall be based on facts and circumstances
as they exist as of the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or event occurring after the Closing, (iii) shall follow the defined
terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent
with GAAP, and (iv) shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash
expense items on a

 



      
 

 



 

pro rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Closing Statement, Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement shall be prepared using the Company Groups past accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods with respect to its
accounting for facility operating leases.

 



 

Section 2.11 **_Payment Agent; Letters of Transmittal_**.

 



 

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company will be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as payment agent (the " _Payment
Agent_ ") and enter into a payment agent agreement with such Payment Agent (in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company) for the purpose of
distributing the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable to
each of the Sellers.

 



 

(b) Prior to receiving any portion of the Merger Consideration, each Seller of
Company Units and each Seller of Phantom Units shall deliver to the Parent an
executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal and/or Employee Unit
Payment Agreement, respectively, and, if a Sellers executed and properly
completed Letter of Transmittal or Employee Unit Payment Agreement, as
applicable, is received at least one day prior to the Closing Date, at Closing
the Parent (or the Payment Agent) shall pay to such Seller such portion of the
Closing Payment Amount as such Seller is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.8(c)_, _Section 2.8(d)_ and/or _Section 2.16_, as applicable,
without interest thereon. To the extent that, as of the day prior to Closing,
any Sellers have not delivered an executed and properly completed copy of the
Letter of Transmittal or Employee Unit Payment Agreement, as applicable, then,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Parent shall mail the Letter of
Transmittal or Employee Unit Payment Agreement, as applicable, to the
applicable Sellers. Upon delivery of such executed and properly completed
Letter of Transmittal or Employee Unit Payment Agreement, as applicable, such
Seller shall be entitled to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event, within ten (10) Business Days) such portion of the Closing Payment
Amount payable to such Seller pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_, _Section 2.8(d)_
and/or _Section 2.16_, as applicable, without interest thereon. In accordance
with this _Section 2.11(b)_, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event, within ten (10) Business Days) after receipt of funds pursuant to
_Section 2.10(d)_, the Payment Agent shall distribute to each Seller that has
delivered to the Parent an executed and properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and/or Employee Unit Payment Agreement such portion of such funds
payable to such Seller pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_, _Section 2.8(d)_ and/or
_Section 2.16_, as applicable, without interest thereon. In the event that
upon receipt of funds pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_, any Seller has not
delivered to the Parent a Letter of Transmittal or Employee Unit Payment
Agreement, as applicable, the Payment Agent shall pay to any such Seller (but
in any event, within ten (10) Business Days) after Parents receipt of such
Sellers executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal or Employee
Unit Payment Agreement, as applicable, such portion, if any, of the funds
received pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_.

 



 

(c) Until surrendered, Certificates shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing
Payment Amount. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates. If the consideration due pursuant to
_Section 2.10(b)_ is to be delivered to a Person other than the Person in
whose

 



      
 

 



 

name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it
shall be a condition to the payment of such consideration that the
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such
transfer otherwise be proper and that the Person requesting such transfer
establish to the satisfaction of the Company and Parent that any applicable
Transfer Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 



 

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then in lieu of surrendering the same, the holder thereof may make an
affidavit setting forth that fact and granting adequate (in the reasonable
judgment of Parent) indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Company, the Surviving Company, Parent or the Seller Representative with
respect to such Certificate(s), and Parent shall thereafter pay the applicable
amounts required to be paid hereunder with respect to each share evidenced by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s).

 



 

(e) Unless required otherwise by applicable Law, any amount held by the
Payment Agent that remains undistributed to the Sellers one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent (which
shall thereafter act as payment agent hereunder) and any Certificate holder
who has not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Section 2.11_
shall thereafter look only to the Parent (as general creditors of the Parent)
for payment of any consideration due pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_, _Section
2.8(d)_ and/or _Section 2.16_ to which such Person is entitled pursuant to
this _Section 2.11_. Any portion of the funds made available to the Parent
for the payment of the Final Merger Consideration determined pursuant to
Section 2.10(b) remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent, the Surviving Company
nor the Seller Representative shall be liable to any such Certificate holder
for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) The Payment Agent, the Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
the Payment Agent, the Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company are
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment, other
than with respect to payments to Sellers that are institutional holders. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.12 **_No Further Rights_**. From and after the Effective Time,
holders of Certificates theretofore evidencing equity interests in the Company
shall cease to have any rights as members of the Company. All consideration
paid pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_, _Section 2.8(d_) and/or _Section 2.16
_upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Company Units.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.13 **_Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_**. At the Effective
Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of

Section 5.6 **_Employee Benefit Arrangements_**.

 



 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the last day

Company or an Affiliate thereof shall provide compensation and benefits for
each employee of any Company Group company (as determined immediately prior to
the Closing) (collectively, the " _Company Group Employees_ ") who continues
employment with Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates after
the Closing (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") that are comparable
in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided by any Company
Group company to such employee immediately prior to the Closing (other than
equity based compensation, tax gross-ups or make whole payments, and benefits
triggered by a change in control). Continuing Employees shall be considered to
be employed by Parent, the Surviving Company or such Affiliate on an "at will"
basis and nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Company or such Affiliate to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee at any time.

 



 

(b) With respect to any 401(k), health or welfare, severance or vacation or
paid time off plan or policy maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their Affiliates for any Continuing Employee, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and levels of severance pay,
vacation pay and other paid time off entitlements, each Continuing Employees
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as all service
with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or
such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving
Company or an Affiliate thereof to the extent recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries under an analogous Company Plan for a similar purpose prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or
compensation. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, the Surviving Company
and their Affiliates shall recognize the accrued but unused vacation
entitlements as of the Closing Date of each Continuing Employee, and shall
permit each Continuing Employee to use such vacation time during the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(c) With respect to each medical, dental, vision and prescription drug plan
and program maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates for the benefit of any Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents), Parent, the Surviving Company or such Affiliate shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing conditions or limitations
under such plan or program, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) to be given credit under such plan or program for
all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents) under any similar Company Plans for the plan year that includes
the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments,
coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in

or cause the Surviving Company or another of its Affiliates to have, in effect
for Continuing Employees a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_Surviving Company 401(k) Plan_"). Parent, the Surviving Company or such
other Affiliate shall, in accordance with its obligations under _Section
5.6(b)_, ensure that Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all service
credited under the Cervalis LLC 401(k) Plan (the " _Cervalis 401(k) Plan_")
for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Surviving Company 401(k)
Plan to the extent credited for the same purpose under the Cervalis 401(k)
Plan as of the Closing Date. Subject to applicable law and the terms of the
Cervalis 401(k) Plan, Continuing Employees who participated in the Cervalis
401(k) Plan shall be entitled to receive a distribution of their vested
account balance under that plan or to roll over all or a portion of such
vested account balance to the Surviving Company 401(k) Plan, and Parent, the
Surviving Company or such Affiliate shall cause the Surviving Company 401(k)
Plan to accept any such rollovers that are "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) made in cash or in the
form of participant loan promissory notes.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.6_ with respect to Company Group Employees and Continuing
Employees are included for the sole benefit of the Company and Parent, and
that nothing in this _Section 5.6_, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification to any Company Plan or other
benefit or compensation plan, agreement or other arrangement or create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any Person other than the
Parties to this Agreement, including any Company Group Employees, former
Company Group Employees, Continuing Employees, any participant in any Company
Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment
or any particular term of condition of employment of any Person with the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

other Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 5.8 **_Exclusivity_**. From the date hereof until the sooner of the
Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, neither the Seller Representative nor any Company Group
company will, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
agent (including financial advisors), Affiliate, partner, representative or
otherwise, continue, solicit, entertain, initiate, facilitate or participate
in or encourage discussions or negotiations with, or the submission of bids,
offers or proposals by, any Person with respect to, whether directly or
indirectly, an acquisition of any Company Group company, or any acquisition of
any membership interest or other equity or other interest of or in any Company
Group company or any assets of any Company Group company, by any means
whatsoever, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
regarding any of the foregoing. The Company and the Seller Representative
will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary and the officers, directors,
employees, agents (including financial advisors), Affiliates, partners and
representatives of the Company, the Seller Representative and each

 



      
 

 



 

Company Subsidiary to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any transaction of the type or
similar to those described in the immediately preceding sentence. In addition,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, except as required by
applicable Law, neither the Seller Representative nor any Company Group
company will, directly or indirectly, through any Person or otherwise disclose
any information not customarily disclosed to any Person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates and representatives) in the ordinary course of
business of a Company Group company or afford to any such Person access to the
properties, books or records of any Company Group company without the prior
written consent of Parent.

 



 

Section 5.9 **_Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy_**. Prior to
the Closing, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate and

Insurance Policy_"). All costs and expenses of such insurance policy shall be
borne by the Parent.

 



 

Section 5.10 **_Update of Disclosure Schedule_**. The Company shall have the
right from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered
which if existing or known at the date of this Agreement would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedule and also
with respect to events or conditions arising after the date hereof and prior
to Closing. Any such supplemental or amended disclosure shall be deemed to
have cured any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement
for purposes of the indemnification provided for in _Article VII_ hereof, but
shall not be deemed to have cured any such breach of representation or
warranty for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ have been satisfied. If prior to the Closing the Parent shall
have reason to believe that any breach of a representation or warranty of the
Company has occurred (other than through notice from the Company), the Parent
shall promptly so notify the Company, in reasonable detail. Nothing in this
Agreement, including this _Section 5.10_, shall imply that the Company is
making any representation or warranty as of any date other than the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.11 **_Directors  and Officers Indemnification; Tail Policy_**.

 



 

(a) The Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer or director of any Company Group entity (the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing)
arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual Action based in whole
or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of any Company Group entity
whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Closing Date but only to the extent a Company Group company would have been
required to do so as of the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified
Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent

 



      
 

 



 

a limited liability company is permitted under Law to indemnify its own
directors or officers (and the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company or its applicable Subsidiary to, pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party
_provided_ that the DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification). Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may retain
counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, and the
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or its applicable
Subsidiary to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
DandO Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii)
the Parent, the Surviving Company or its applicable Subsidiary and each DandO
Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter; _provided_ , that neither the Surviving Company,
any of its Subsidiaries nor the Parent shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 5.11_ shall notify the Parent upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (but the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may
have under this _Section 5.11_ except to the extent such failure prejudices
such party). The Parties hereto agree that all rights to indemnification
hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in
defense of any such action or suit, existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified
Parties with respect to matters occurring through the Closing Date shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified
Liabilities.

 



 

(b) The Parent covenants, for itself, its Affiliates, the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns, that it and
they shall not institute (directly or indirectly), encourage or assist, any
Action in any court or before any administrative agency or before any other
tribunal against any of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to any
liabilities, actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or demands of any
nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive or otherwise),
based in whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part
to (i) the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of any
Company Group entity whether pertaining to any matter existing on or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby including, without limitation, any information provided to
the Parent or Merger Sub, or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, or any
oral or written statements, or any failure to provide information or make
disclosures, or any actions or failures to take action by any of the DandO
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take any action
directly or indirectly to disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions of the
organizational documents of any Company Group entity and any other written
agreements of any Company Group entity that provide indemnification of and
expense reimbursement to DandO Indemnified Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to obtain as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at
least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company Group,
in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

contained in this Agreement as well as the covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, shall survive until the close of business on the date that
is the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,

resolved. In addition, this _Section 7.1_ shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the Parties which by its terms requires performance after the
Closing.

 



 

Section 7.2 **_Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the other limitations in this
_Section 7.2_, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall, severally and
not jointly, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify Parent, each
of its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
members, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_
") from and against any Losses arising from or related to: (i) the breach of
any representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ hereof or in any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this
Agreement; (ii) the breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement required to be performed prior to the Closing;
(iii) any Taxes of the Company Group attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(except as included in the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital); (iv) any
severance payments required under an employment agreement in effect
immediately prior to Closing (other than payments for accrued but unpaid
compensation, benefits or expense reimbursements) made to a Continuing
Employee identified on _Schedule 7.2(a)(iv)_ as a result of such Continuing
Employees termination of employment with Parent, the Surviving Company or any
Affiliate thereof, as applicable, for any reason, within six (6) months
following the Closing Date or (v) any unauthorized use, disclosure, or other
breach of protected health information, or any other failure by the Company
Group to comply prior to the Closing with any requirement under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Health Information
Technology for

 



      
 

 



 

Economic and Clinical Health Act, the regulations promulgated under any of the
foregoing, or any state privacy Laws or regulations, but not any compliance
costs incurred by the Company Group for periods after the Closing.

 



 

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 7.2(a)_ above is subject to
each of the following limitations:

 



 

(i) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to make any claims pursuant
to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) or _Section 7.2(a)(v)_ unless and until the Parent
Indemnitees, in the aggregate, have suffered Losses as a result of breaches
described in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ in excess of $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_
") ( _provided_ that such Parent Indemnitee shall only be entitled to seek
recovery for Losses to the extent exceeding the Deductible) and no individual
claim for Losses may be made that, together with all series of related
matters, is less than $50,000 and no such claim will be counted towards the
Deductible.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate liability of the Sellers in satisfaction of claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to
Fundamental Representations) and _Section 7.2(a)(v)_ shall not exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. The aggregate liability of the Sellers in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_
with respect to Fundamental Representations, _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, _Section
7.2(a)(iii)_ and _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_ shall not exceed the Final Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(iii) Except pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ with respect to Fundamental
Representations, _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ and _Section
7.2(a)(iv)_: (1) the Parent Indemnitees sole recourse for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be to claim against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
(2) no claim by any Parent Indemnitee shall be asserted against, and no Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification from, any Seller or the Seller
Representative individually, and (3) the Parent Indemnitees shall have no
recourse to any Seller or Seller Representative to the extent there are
insufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to satisfy any claim for
Losses. The Parent and Merger Sub recognize that under the terms of the Escrow
Agreement the remaining balance in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, less any
reserves for then-pending valid claims, shall be released to the Sellers on
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and that thereupon the Parent
Indemnitees shall have no further recourse against the Sellers for
indemnification claims pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than with
respect to Fundamental Representations).

 



 

(c) _Indemnification by the Parent_. From and after the Closing, the Parent
shall indemnify the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, members, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and hold each Seller Indemnitee
harmless against any Losses arising from or related to: (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ hereof or in any
certificate delivered by the Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any such representations and warranties and (ii) the breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Notice of Claim_. Any indemnified party making a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(c)_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") must give the Seller Representative or Parent, as the case may be,
written notice of such claim describing such claim and the nature and amount
of such Loss, to the extent that the nature and amount thereof are
determinable at such time or an explanation if not so determinable (a " _Claim
Notice_ "), promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice
of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "
_Proceeding_ ") against or involving the Indemnified Party by a third party or
otherwise discovers the Liability or facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to notify or delay
in notifying the Seller Representative or Parent, as the case may be, will not
relieve Parent or the Sellers, as applicable (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
of its obligations pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(c)_ (as applicable),
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result
thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. With respect to the defense of any
Proceeding against or involving an Indemnified Party involving a claim for
which indemnification is provided, at its option within twenty (20) days of
receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may (subject to the relevant
maximum dollar limitations with respect to claimed Losses, as applicable, and
as reduced by the amount of all other pending claims assuming the full amount
of such claims were actually paid to an Indemnified Party), assume the defense
of such Proceeding and appoint as lead counsel of such defense a legal counsel
of national standing selected by the Indemnifying Party so long as the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for Losses related to such Proceeding or the settlement or
defense thereof, subject to the applicable limitations set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_.

 



 

(iii) _Settlement of Claims_. The Indemnifying Party must obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party prior to entering into any settlement
of any claim or Proceeding or ceasing to defend any claim or Proceeding unless
the proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages, all such
money damages will be the responsibility of, and paid by, the Indemnifying
Party, and the proposed settlement does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief on the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party will not
settle any claim for which it has sought or is seeking recovery without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

 



 

(e) _Other Limitations_.

 



 

(i) No Parent Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_ for any breach of a
representation or warranty hereunder if one or more of the individuals listed
on _Schedule 4.7_ , on behalf of Parent, or one or more of the individuals
listed in the definition of "Knowledge," on behalf of Sellers, as applicable,
had actual knowledge (excluding constructive knowledge and any obligation of
inquiry) of such breach on or before Closing.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) Where the Sellers have made a payment to a Parent Indemnitee in relation
to any Losses which is the subject of a claim and Parent or any of its
Affiliates are entitled to recover (whether by insurance, payment, discount,
credit, relief or otherwise) from a third party a sum which indemnifies or
compensates Parent Indemnitees (in whole or in part) in respect of the Loss
which is the subject of such claim, Parent or its relevant Affiliates shall
(i) promptly notify the Seller Representative of the fact and provide such
information as the Seller Representative may reasonably require, (ii) take all
reasonable steps or proceedings as the Seller Representative may require to
enforce such right and (iii) pay to the Seller Representative, as soon as
practicable after receipt, an amount equal to the amount recovered from the
third party (not to exceed the amount of the Sellers payment with respect to
such claim). The amount of any Loss shall be net of any amounts recovered by
the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities, reimbursement
arrangements, or contracts (including with respect to any breaches thereof)
pursuant to which or under which such Person or such Persons Affiliates is a
party or has rights with respect to such Loss. In the event of any breach
giving rise to an indemnification obligation under this _Section 7.2_, the
Indemnified Party shall take, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to
take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the related
breach (including taking reasonable steps to prevent any contingent Loss from
becoming an actual Loss).

 



 

(iii) For purposes of this _Section 7.2_, if any representation or warranty
contained herein is qualified by materiality, "Company Material Adverse
Effect", "Parent Material Adverse Effect", or a derivative thereof, such
qualification will be ignored and deemed not included in such representation
or warranty for purposes of calculating the amount of Losses with respect to
such breach or inaccuracy.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
7.2_, no indemnification shall be provided under this Agreement with respect
to any consequential, special or incidental damages, lost profits, damage to
goodwill or lost revenues, Losses that are not reasonably foreseeable or
punitive damages, _provided_ that Losses of any Indemnified Party may include
punitive damages to the extent that they are actually adjudicated as due and
actually paid by such Indemnified Party to a third party in connection with an
indemnified Third Party Claim.

 



 

(v) Upon the payment in full of any indemnity pursuant to this _Article VII_,
the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of the Indemnified
Party in respect of the matter in respect of which such indemnity has been
paid.

 



 

(f) _Manner of Payment_. Except pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ with respect
to Fundamental Representations, _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_
and _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_, any indemnification claim that is required to be
paid by the Sellers to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_
shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnification claim that is
required to be paid by the Sellers to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(iv)_ shall be paid first from the Severance Escrow Fund.

 



 

(g) _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that from and after the Closing, claims under this _Article VII_ shall be the
exclusive and sole remedy of the

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except (i) with respect to any claims based on
fraud or willful misconduct, or (ii) as provided in _Section 2.10_ or
_Section 10.11_), and neither the Parent nor Merger Sub nor any Seller shall
have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this
Agreement or any other Loss arising out of the negotiation, entry into or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) The following provisions (which shall take precedence over any other
provision of this Agreement in the event of a conflict) shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as among the Parent, the Sellers, the Seller
Representative and the Company and its Subsidiaries for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall have responsibility for, and shall pay or cause to be
paid when due, any and all Taxes relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
for or relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except for the amount of any
such Taxes that are taken into account as a Liability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the calculation of Adjusted Working Capital. The Seller
Representative shall timely prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on
or before the Closing Date and Sellers shall pay the Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns, provided, however, that Parent shall be liable for and shall
pay the amount of any such Taxes that were taken into account as a Liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the calculation of Adjusted
Working Capital. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared or completed in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to Tax Returns concerning the income, properties or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by Law or regulation
or otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent. Prior to the filing of any
such Tax Return (other than an information return with respect to an Income
Tax for which Sellers, rather than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is
liable) that was not filed before the Closing Date, the Seller Representative
shall provide the Parent with a substantially final draft of such Tax Return
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return. The
Parent shall notify the Seller Representative of any objections that the
Parent may have to any items set forth in any such draft Tax Return within
five (5) days, and the Parent and the Seller Representative shall agree to
consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the Parent and the
Seller Representative are unable to reach such agreement within five (5) days
after receipt by the Seller Representative of such notice, the disputed items
shall be resolved by the Accounting Expert and any determination by the
Accounting Expert shall be final. The Accounting Expert shall resolve any
disputed items within five (5) days of having the item referred to it pursuant
to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Expert shall be borne equally by the Parent and the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(c) The Parent shall timely prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all Straddle Period Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall
pay the Taxes shown as due on such Straddle Period Tax Returns. Such Straddle
Period Tax Returns shall be prepared or completed in a manner consistent with
prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such Tax
Returns concerning the income, properties or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by Law or regulation or otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Seller Representative. Prior to the filing of any
such Straddle Period Tax Return

 



      
 

 



 

the Parent shall provide the Seller Representative with a substantially final
draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date for such Straddle Period Tax Return. The Seller Representative
shall notify the Parent of any objections that the Seller Representative may
have to any items set forth in any such draft Straddle Period Tax Return
within five (5) days, and the Parent and the Seller Representative shall agree
to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the Parent and the
Seller Representative are unable to reach such agreement within five (5) days
after receipt by the Parent of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Accounting Expert and any determination by the Accounting
Expert shall be final. The Accounting Expert shall resolve any disputed items
within five (5) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such
procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting
Expert shall be borne equally by the Parent and the Seller Representative. The
Sellers shall pay such amounts properly allocable to the Seller (as determined
under Section 7.3(d) below) to the Parent at least two days prior to the date
on which such properly allocable amounts are due to the applicable taxing
authority reduced, as applicable, by the amount of any such Tax taken into
account as a Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
calculation of Adjusted Working Capital.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries allocable to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts (including
sales and use taxes), or employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use taxes), or employment or
payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. Any exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on
the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each period. All determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable
prior practice of the Company.

 



 

(e) After the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall have the exclusive
right to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries (at the
Sellers expense) in any and all Tax audits, assessments or administrative or
court proceedings (" _Tax Contests_ ") relating to Tax Returns of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Parent shall have the right, at the Parents own
expense, to participate in any such Tax Contest and to employ counsel of its
choice (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller
Representative) for purposes of such participation.

 



 

(f) Except for Tax Contests of the Company or its Subsidiaries described in
_Section 7.3(e)_, after the Closing Date, the Parent shall have the exclusive
right to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries (at
Parents expense) in any and all Tax Contests of the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to Tax Returns for the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any Post-Closing Tax Period and for Straddle Period Tax Returns; provided,
however, that the Seller Representative shall have the right, at the Sellers
own expense, to participate in any such audit,

 



      
 

 



 

assessment or proceeding and to employ counsel of its choice (which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent) for purposes of such
participation to the extent that any such Tax Contest could reasonably be
expected to result in a payment by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 7.3_. In the event that the Parent proposes to compromise or settle
any Tax claim or consent or agree to any Tax Liability, relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall have the right to review such
proposed compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Parent shall not agree or consent to
compromise or settle any issue or claim arising in any such Tax Contest or
otherwise agree to or consent to any Tax Liability, to the extent that any
such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement could reasonably be expected
to result in a payment by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section
7.3_ **.**

 



 

(g) The Seller Representative agrees to notify the Parent promptly in writing
upon receipt by the Sellers, or any Affiliate of the Sellers, of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income,
properties or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Parent agrees
to notify the Seller Representative promptly in writing upon receipt by the
Parent or any Affiliate of the Parent (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments relating to the income, properties or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to result in a payment by
the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_.

 



 

(h) After the Closing Date, the Parent and the Seller Representative agree to
provide each other with such cooperation and information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries as any other Party may reasonably request in (i)
filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or other Tax filing or claim for
refund of Taxes, (ii) determining any Tax Liability or right to refund of
Taxes, (iii) conducting or defending any audit or other proceeding in respect
of Taxes, or (iv) effectuating the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Party shall be unreasonably required to prepare any
document, or determine any information, not then in its possession in response
to a request under this _Section 7.3(h)_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers shall be liable for, and shall pay any Transfer Taxes, and
shall file all necessary returns, reports or other filings with respect to all
such Taxes.

 



 

(j) Any Tax refunds that are received by the Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Parent, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries become entitled that relate to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods shall be for the account of the Sellers, excluding any Tax refund
or credit taken into account as a receivable in the calculation of Adjusted
Working Capital, and the Parent shall pay over to the Sellers any refund or
the amount of any such credit (net of any income Taxes of the Parent, the
Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to such refund or credit) within 15
days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 



 

(k) The Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, (i) amend any Tax Returns (or file any Tax Returns that
have not been filed) of the Company or its Subsidiaries filed with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or with respect to any Straddle Period of the
Company or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any such
Tax year ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle
Period,

 



      
 

 



 

in each case, without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 7.4 **_Price Adjustment_**. All amounts paid pursuant to this _Article
VII_ shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Final Merger
Consideration, to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 7.5 **_Purchase Price Allocation_**.

 



 

(a) Upon the signing of this Agreement, Parent, in consultation with the
Seller Representative, shall engage a nationally recognized valuation firm
(the " _Appraiser_ ") to perform an appraisal of the Company Groups assets
for the purpose of allocating the Estimated Merger Consideration (and any
purchase price adjustments) among the Company Groups assets. The Seller
Representative shall be consulted throughout the appraisal process and shall
have the right to participate with Parent in all material discussions with the
Appraiser and review all materials and correspondence provided to the
Appraiser.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days of the signing of this Agreement, Parent shall deliver to
Seller Representative for review and comment a preliminary appraisal with a
preliminary allocation of the Estimated Merger Consideration, all other
capitalizable costs and the amount of assumed liabilities (if any) among the
Company Groups assets.

 



 

(c) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall provide to the Seller
Representative a copy of the Appraisers proposed final valuation and copies
of IRS Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto, prepared in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code, with Parents proposed allocation of the
Estimated Merger Consideration, all other capitalizable costs and the amount
of assumed liabilities (if any) among the Company Groups assets (the "
_Proposed Allocation Schedule_ ").

 



 

(d) The Seller Representative will review the proposed final valuation and the
Proposed Allocation Schedule and, to the extent the Seller Representative in
good faith disagrees with the content of the proposed final valuation or the
Proposed Allocation Schedule, the Seller Representative will, within 30 days
after receipt, provide written notice to Parent of such disagreement. The
Seller Representative and Parent will attempt in good faith to resolve any
such disagreement. If the Seller Representative and Parent are unable to
reach a good faith agreement as to the content of the Proposed Allocation
Schedule within 150 days after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative and
Parent will each be free to use their own allocation of the Estimated Merger
Consideration (and any price adjustments) capitalizable costs and the amount
of assumed liabilities (if any) in the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns (including filing IRS Form 8594 with their respective federal income
Tax Returns for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and any other
forms or statements required by the Code or any Tax Authority).

 



 

(e) If Parent and the Seller Representative agree on the Proposed Allocation
Schedule or any modification thereof (an " _Agreed Allocation Schedule_ "),
(i) Parent and the Sellers will report the allocation of the Estimated Merger
Consideration all other capitalizable costs and the amount of assumed
liabilities (if any) among the Company Groups assets in a manner consistent
with such Agreed Allocation Schedule and will act in accordance with such
Agreed Allocation

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule in the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns (including
filing IRS Form 8594 with their respective federal income tax returns for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date and any other forms or statements
required by the Code or any Tax authority), (ii) any adjustments to the
Estimated Merger Consideration shall be allocated in a manner consistent with
the Agreed Allocation Schedule, (iii) each of the Parent and the Seller
Representative agrees to promptly provide the other Party with any additional
information and reasonable assistance required to complete IRS Form 8594 or
compute Taxes arising in connection with (or otherwise affected by) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) Parent and the Seller
Representative will promptly inform one another in writing of any challenge by
any Tax authority to any Agreed Allocation Schedule made pursuant to this
Section 7.5 and agree to consult with and keep one another informed with
respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with
respect to, any such challenge.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **SELLERS  REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

Section 8.1 **_Seller Representative_**. The Parties have agreed that it is
desirable to designate LDG Holdings LLC to act on behalf of the Sellers for
certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the " _Seller Representative_
").

 



 

Section 8.2 **_Authority and Rights_**. By any Sellers submission of a Letter
of Transmittal and/or Employee Unit Payment Agreement pursuant hereto, each
such Seller shall immediately prior to the Effective Time irrevocably ratify
the designation of LDG Holdings LLC (or any successor representative) as
Seller Representative as provided in this Agreement including the power to
take any and all actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement and
take all actions necessary in the judgment of Seller Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing (including, but not limited to, negotiating,
entering into and performing its obligations under a payment agency agreement
relating to the distribution of the Merger Consideration to the Sellers).
Seller Representative shall take any and all actions that it believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the
Sellers, as fully as such Sellers were acting on their own behalf. All actions
taken by Seller Representative under this Agreement shall be binding upon all
Sellers and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by each of them. Parent and Merger Sub shall serve notice to, and deal
exclusively with, the Seller Representative with respect to any and all
matters concerning any of the Sellers arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents (except as may otherwise expressly be
set forth in such Transaction Documents) or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document purported by the Seller
Representative to have been executed by or on behalf of any of the Sellers as
fully binding upon them. If the Seller Representative shall resign, dissolve,
cease to exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative of the Sellers, the Sellers shall, within ten (10) days after
the occurrence of such event, appoint a successor representative and, promptly
thereafter, shall notify the Company of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall become the "Seller Representative" for purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If for any reason there is no
Seller Representative at any time, all references herein or in any other
Transaction Document to the Seller Representative shall be deemed to refer to
the Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

themselves, as applicable. By ratifying approval of the Seller Representative
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 8.2_, each Seller in its
capacity as such agrees that any action taken by the Seller Representative on
its behalf pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents shall be fully binding on them.

 



 

Section 8.3 **_Limitations on Liability; Seller Representative Expense Fund_**
_. _Except in cases of willful misconduct or fraud, the Seller Representative
will have no liability to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Sellers or
their successors or assigns with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith in its capacity as Seller Representative and shall be
entitled to indemnification and reimbursement from the Sellers against any
loss, liability, fees or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith in its capacity as Seller Representative. The Seller
Representative may retain the Seller Representative Reserve Amount as a
reserve fund (the " _Seller Representative Reserve Fund_ ") solely for the
purpose of paying directly, or reimbursing the Seller Representative for, any
third party expenses incurred by the Seller Representative pursuant to this
Agreement. The Seller Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Seller Representative Reserve Fund other than as a result of
its gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as practicable following
the release in full of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Seller Representative
will distribute the balance of the Seller Representative Reserve Fund to the
Sellers (or to a payment agent for further distribution to the Sellers);
_provided_ that if there are any pending but unresolved claims of any Parent
Indemnitee, then such remaining Seller Representative Expense Fund amounts
will be held by the Seller Representative until all indemnification claims
have been finally resolved and the Seller Representative has been reimbursed
in full for all costs and expenses actually incurred in connection with the
administration of its duties and fulfillment of its obligations hereunder.

under _Section 5.2_ (Access to Information; Confidentiality), _Section 5.5_

Section 10.4 **_Amendments and Waivers_**. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the
Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

 



 

Section 10.5 **_Exhibits and Disclosure Schedule_**.

 



 

(a) All Exhibits, Schedules and the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any matter
disclosed pursuant to any Section of the Disclosure Schedule whose relevance
or applicability to any representation or

 



      
 

 



 

warranty made elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information called for by
any other Section of the Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure shall be deemed to be an exception to such
representations and warranties and to be disclosed with respect to all such
Sections of the Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross-reference thereto.

 



 

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty nor the mere inclusion of any item in a Schedule or in the Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an
admission by a Party that such item represents an exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 10.6 **_Headings_**. The table of contents and section headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be
deemed a part of this Agreement or affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.7 **_Construction_**. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.8 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule and the Exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior
understandings, negotiations, agreements, discussions or representations among
the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate
in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

 



 

Section 10.9 **_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any provision,
or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.10 **_Expenses_**. Unless otherwise provided herein, each Party
agrees to pay, without right of reimbursement from the other Parties, all
costs and expenses incurred by it incident to the performance of its
obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed by it in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.11 **_Specific Performance_**. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that,
subject to _Section 9.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to equitable relief,
without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or
Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any
Order sought by the Company and/or the Seller Representative to cause Parent
and/or Merger Sub to perform its agreements and covenants contained in this
Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each Party
further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_,
and each Party (i) irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and
(ii) agrees to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other Party or Parties in
obtaining such equitable relief. Subject to and without limiting the rights of
Parent arising under _Section 9.1_, each Party further agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable
relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.12 **_Governing Law_**. This Agreement and all claims arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Law of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 10.13 **_Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
(i) state courts of the State of New York located in New York County, New York
and (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of the
State of New York (collectively, the " _Courts_ ") for the purposes of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any Action relating hereto
except in such Courts). Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered
mail to such Partys respective address set forth in _Section 10.3_ will be
effective service of process for any Action in New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in the Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Action
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.14 **_Legal Representation_**.

 



 

(a) The Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Company) acknowledges and agrees that Pillsbury
Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (" _Pillsbury_ ") has acted as counsel for the
Sellers and the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Pillsbury has not
acted as counsel for any other Person, including the Parent.

 



 

(b) Only the Sellers, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall be
considered clients of Pillsbury in the Acquisition Engagement. The Parent, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Surviving Company) acknowledges and agrees that all confidential
communications between the Sellers, the Company and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Pillsbury, on the other hand, in the course
of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality
applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company), and not the Company, and shall not pass
to or be claimed, held, or used by the Parent or the Surviving Company upon or
after the Closing. Accordingly, the Parent shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Pillsbury relating to the Acquisition
Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that files of
Pillsbury in respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Sellers and their Affiliates shall hold such property rights
and (ii) Pillsbury shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Surviving Company or the
Parent by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Pillsbury and the
Company or otherwise; _provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Pillsbury shall not disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to any third parties (other than representatives,
accountants and advisors of the Sellers and their Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that such representatives, accounts and advisors are instructed to maintain
the confidence of such attorney-client communications). The Parent, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving
Company) irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or obtain
information or documentation relating to the Acquisition Engagement, to the
extent that such information or documentation was subject to an attorney-
client privilege, work product protection or other expectation of
confidentiality owed to the Sellers and/or their Affiliates. If and to the
extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Company) shall have the
right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, the Parent,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Surviving Company) shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the
prior written consent of the Seller Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(c) The Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Surviving Company) acknowledges and agrees that Pillsbury has
acted as counsel for the Sellers, the Company and their respective Affiliates
for several years and that the Sellers reasonably anticipate that Pillsbury
will continue to represent them and/or their Affiliates in future matters.
Accordingly, the Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Company) expressly (i) consents to Pillsburys representation of the
Sellers and/or their Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any
of the foregoing Persons so desire) in any matter, including, without
limitation, any post-Closing matter in which the interests of the Parent and
the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and whether or not such
matter is one in which Pillsbury may have previously advised the Sellers, the
Company or their respective Affiliates and (ii) consents to the disclosure by
Pillsbury to the Sellers or their Affiliates of any information learned by
Pillsbury in the course of its representation of the Sellers, the Company or
their respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, or Pillsburys
duty of confidentiality.

 



 

(d) The Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Surviving Company) further covenants and agrees that each shall
not assert any claim against Pillsbury in respect of legal services provided
to the Company or its Affiliates by Pillsbury in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing, the Surviving Company shall have no attorney-
client relationship with Pillsbury, unless and to the extent Pillsbury is
expressly engaged in writing by the Surviving Company to represent the
Surviving Company after the Closing and either (i) such engagement involves no
conflict of interest with respect to any Seller and/or any Sellers Affiliates
or (ii) such Seller and/or any such Affiliate, as applicable, consent in
writing to such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving Company
by Pillsbury after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions
hereof. Furthermore, Pillsbury, in its sole discretion, shall be permitted to
withdraw from representing the Surviving Company in order to represent or
continue so representing the Sellers.

 



 

(f) The Sellers, the Company and the Parent consent to the arrangements in
this _Section 10.14_ and waive any actual or potential conflict of interest
that may be involved in connection with any representation by Pillsbury
permitted hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.15 **_Time of the Essence_**. Time is of the essence for each and
every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the exercise of
any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day
that is not a Business Day, the Party having such privilege or duty may
exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day
which is a Business Day.

 



 

Section 10.16 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first above written.
