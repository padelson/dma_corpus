respective affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with the allocation
under Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.2(b) on any tax return or otherwise, unless
required to do so by Applicable Law or a "determination," within the meaning
of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code.

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar
laws affecting creditors rights generally and (b) equitable principles which
may limit the availability of certain equitable remedies (such as specific
performance) in certain instances.

 

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention_

 

Other than any requirements that Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative
Agent, and the other lenders party to the Credit Agreement consent to the
Closing ("Lender Consent") and that there be obtained Consents to assignment

delivery, and performance by Seller of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document executed or to be executed by Seller in connection

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (a) conflict
with or result in a violation of any provision of the operating agreement or
other governing instruments of Seller, (b) conflict with or result in a
violation of any provision of, or constitute (with or without the giving of

Except as disclosed on Exhibit 4.6, there are no pending or, to Sellers

Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated

Section 4.7 _Basic Documents_

The Permits, Easements and Transferred Contracts (together, herein called the
"Basic Documents"), comprise all such instruments reasonably necessary to
construct, own and operate the AGS North Pipeline and the Expansion System.

and, to Sellers Knowledge, no breach or default (with or without the giving
of notice or the passage of time, or both) by any third party exists with

automatic termination of, or give a counterparty thereto the right to
terminate (when taken together with all other such breaches and defaults) and
(b) would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
the ownership or use of the Properties after the Effective Date. Seller has
not received a written notice of any breach or default under any Basic
Document. No counterparty to a Transferred Contract that includes a dedication
has asked to be released from such dedication (in whole or in part). Except
as set forth on Exhibit 4.5, the entry into this Agreement by Seller (and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) will not give any
counterparty to any Basic Document the right to terminate or modify the
provisions of any Basic Document or result in the early termination of any
Basic Document. To Sellers Knowledge, each Basic Document is valid, binding,
and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect
as to the parties thereto, and true, correct, and complete copies of all Basic
Documents and any amendments and supplements thereto have been made available
to Buyer. The Seller has not received with respect to any Properties (or
previously used to acquire any Properties) a written proceeding regarding
eminent domain.

Laws") and (ii) the Properties have been operated by Seller in material
compliance with all Applicable Laws or any material non-compliance that has
been fully remedied before the date hereof.

Section 4.9 _Governmental Permits and Regulation_

(a) The Permits and the Regulatory Permits constitute all material
governmental licenses, permits, variances, exemptions, Orders, franchises,
consents, registrations, permissions, approvals and authorizations that are
necessary or appropriate under all Applicable Laws to lawfully own the
Properties and construct and own the AGS North Pipeline and the Expansion
System. Seller is not in violation of any Permits or Applicable Law applicable
to the ownership or use of the Properties and, other than the Notices of
Violation (NOVs) issued by Governmental Authorities that are disclosed in
Exhibit 4.9, has not received written notice of any violations in respect of
any Permits or Regulatory Permits that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the ownership or use of the Properties after
the Effective Date. 

 



9 (b) Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that the Properties have never
been owned or operated by any person or entity that is a public utility under

Utility Code, 66 Pa. C. S. § 102, or (ii) holds a certificate of public
convenience to own or operate any property used and useful in the public
service under Chapter 11 of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code, 66 Pa. C. S.
§§ 1101-1104.

 

(c) Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that Seller has not operated, or
provided services utilizing, the Properties in a manner that would subject
Seller or the Properties to the jurisdiction of, or regulation by, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978. Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that neither
the Properties nor any services provided utilizing the Properties is the
subject of a public or, to Sellers Knowledge, non-public complaint
proceeding, audit, inquiry, investigation or similar proceeding before, or
conducted by, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or its staff regarding
whether the Properties or any services provided utilizing the Properties are
subject to the jurisdiction of, or regulation by, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or the Natural Gas
Policy Act of 1978.

Section 4.10 _Broker s Fees_

 

Neither Seller nor any of its affiliates has any liability or obligation to
pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement for which Buyer or its
affiliates could become liable or obligated.

 

Section 4.11 _Taxes_

 

To Sellers Knowledge, all Asset Taxes have been timely paid, except for Asset
Taxes not yet due. None of the Properties in which Seller owns an interest is
subject to or properly treated as part of any tax partnership as defined in
Section 761 of the Code. There are no outstanding liens or other encumbrances
with respect to Taxes upon any of the Properties, except for liens
for current period ad valorem Taxes not yet due. Seller is not a foreign
person (within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code). All Tax Returns
relating to the Properties have been duly filed on a timely basis with the
appropriate tax authority and all Taxes due relating to the Properties have
been duly and timely paid, except those disclosed on Exhibit 4.11 as being
contested in good faith.

 

Section 4.12 _Title to Personal Property; Sufficiency and Condition of
Personal Property_.

personal property used by Seller (or held for use by it) or necessary (or that
will be necessary), in each case, in connection with the development,
construction, ownership, maintenance and/or operation of the AGS North
Pipeline.

(c) The AGS North Pipeline (and all other Properties that are "in service")
have been owned, constructed, maintained and operated in a good and
workmanlike manner in accordance with customary practices in the gas gathering
and transportation services industry and, to Sellers Knowledge, in accordance
with the Basic Documents. The AGS North Pipeline has been in continuous
operation since it was placed into service, except for temporary cessations
for the performance of maintenance, repair, replacement, modification,
improvement or expansion. To Sellers Knowledge, (i) the tangible assets and
property comprising the Properties are in good operating or working condition
and repair (subject to ordinary wear and tear), (ii) are adequate for the use
to which they are currently being put, (iii) are structurally sound with no
known defects, and (iv) are not in need of any maintenance or repair (other

Article VI. __

 

 _Certain Covenants of Seller_

 

Section 6.1 _Access to Properties and Files_

 

From the date hereof until Closing, and to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, Seller will give Buyer, and its attorneys and other representatives,
access, during Sellers normal business hours, to the Properties (save and
except the right to disturb the surface of any Property or perform any
integrity testing but including access to the Properties that may be necessary
to review Sellers integrity testing on the tangible personal property
included in the Properties), the Records and to any information in its
possession or control relating to the Properties including all Easement files,
contract files, Permit and Regulatory Permit files, internal and external
assessments, reports and correspondence addressing environmental, health and
safety matters, filings, correspondence and reports to Governmental
Authorities, and other information of Seller and its affiliates pertaining to
the acquisition, ownership and operation of the Properties. Buyer shall have
the right to inspect all such information to the extent that such inspection
is necessary in order to investigate (a) if Sellers representations are true
and correct for the purpose of satisfying Buyers conditions under Section
8.1; (b) if the conditions to Buyers obligation to close will be satisfied at
Closing; and (c) if there are any Defects, as defined below, and if any
Defects are cured. All confidential and proprietary information obtained by
Buyer from Seller pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be maintained and held by
Buyer pursuant to and in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that following the Closing, Buyer shall have the
unconditional right to disclose any information regarding the Properties. If
Buyer or any of its representatives inspect any lands covered by the
Properties, such persons shall observe all safety and other regulations of
which such persons are made aware in writing which are in effect at such
lands. Buyer shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against, any and all loss, damage, costs, liability,
claim or suit, whether for bodily injury or death of any person, damage to or
destruction or loss of property, or otherwise, arising out of Buyer or its
representatives having accessed to such lands except to the extent that such
loss, damage, cost, liability, claim or suit was occasioned by any Seller
Indemnitees gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Confidentiality
Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms; _provided_ that, if the Closing shall occur then, at Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and, thereafter, shall be null and
void and of no further force and effect. From and after Closing, Seller shall
(and shall cause its affiliates to) hold in strict confidence all information,
data and other materials related to the Properties and not disclose any such
information, data and/or material to any person or party (other than to its
affiliates and representatives with a need to know such information and who
agree to be bound by the foregoing confidentiality obligation with respect
thereto) without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 

Section 6.2 _Easement Amendments and Required Contract Extensions, Renewals
and Executions_

 

(a) From the date hereof until Closing, Seller (i) will amend the Easements
comprising the Expansion System and denoted with a single asterisk (*) in
Exhibit 2.1(b) to the extent necessary to allow a gas pipeline with an outside
diameter of up to 30 inches to be constructed, operated and maintained
pursuant to

 



12  such Easements upon the lands covered thereby (such amendments, the
"Diameter Amendments"), (ii) will enter into the Beazer Amendment and (iii)
will amend the Easements comprising the Expansion System and noted with a
plus sign (+) in Exhibit 2.1(b) (the "Other Required Amendments" and, together
with the Diameter Amendments and the Beazer Amendment, the
"Easement Amendments"). Copies of the Easement Amendments acquired by Seller
prior to the date of this Agreement are attached hereto in Part C of Exhibit
6.2. From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller (I) will not enter into
any Easement Amendment that is not substantially (and in all material
respects) consistent with the form attached hereto in Part A of Exhibit 6.2
(in the case of any Easement Amendment that is a Diameter Amendment), (II)
will not enter into the Beazer Amendment if the form thereof is not
substantially (and in all material respects) consistent with the form attached
hereto in Part D of Exhibit 6.2, and (III) that does not contain the
amendments described in Part B of Exhibit 6.2 (in the case of any Other
Required Amendment), in each case, without Buyers prior written consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld (it being understood and agreed that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers prior consent must be requested and
will be considered to be reasonably withheld if Seller proposes to enter into
any Diameter Amendment that (A) does not provide rights to lay at least a 30
inch, outside diameter, pipeline on the lands covered by the
applicable underlying Easement, (B) requires Buyer to make any payments to
the grantor thereof (or otherwise expend any funds for the benefit of the
grantor thereof) or (C) reduces or otherwise modifies, in any respect, any
deadlines (or other time periods) for (or during which) construction or other
activities on the Easement must commence or be all or substantially
completed). The consent that may be required by Buyer pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence shall be given in writing (or denied) with
respect to any Easement Amendment within one (1) business day of Sellers
request therefor, and, in the absence of Buyers affirmative consent or denial
within such period, Buyer shall be deemed to have consented to the subject
Easement Amendment proposed by Seller. In addition to the foregoing, prior to
Closing, Buyer may request that Seller seek to obtain certain other amendments
to the Easements comprising the Expansion System (any such amendments,
the "Additional Amendments"), in which case, Buyer will provide Seller with
the requested amendment language (and assist Seller, at its request, in
obtaining the same). Buyer will reimburse Seller for all reasonable,
documented, third-party costs and expenses that are incurred by Seller in
obtaining any Additional Amendments, which reimbursable amounts shall be in
addition to, and shall not be deducted from, the Reimbursable Easement
Amendment Costs. Seller will keep Buyer reasonably informed with respect to
its progress in obtaining the Easement Amendments (and any Additional
Amendments) under this Section 6.2.

 

(b) Within forty-eight (48) hours of the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
shall pay $2,500,000.00 ("Easement Amendment Payment") in cash to an account
specified by Seller, which amount Buyer and Seller believe to be sufficient to
reimburse Seller for all amounts paid by Seller for documented third party
brokerage costs and amounts paid to the grantors of the Easements to obtain
the Easement Amendments in accordance with this Section 6.2 (the "Reimbursable
Easement Amendment Costs"). Subject to Section 6.2(c), the Easement Amendment
Payment to Seller under this Section 6.2(b) shall be non-refundable and is
being made by Buyer to Seller in addition to the Purchase Price. Buyer will
not be responsible for and will have no liability for any Reimbursable
Easement Amendment Costs in excess of the Easement Amendment Payment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will reimburse Seller for all reasonably
documented, third-party costs and expenses that are incurred by Seller to fell
trees associated with any Easement Amendments and/or Additional Amendments,
which reimbursable amounts shall be in addition to, and shall not be deducted
from, the Reimbursable Easement Amendment Costs.

 

(c) At the Closing, all Easement Amendment Payment funds that have not been
spent by Seller in accordance with this Agreement (or otherwise irrevocably
committed to the landowner or broker related to such Easement Amendment) shall
be promptly paid in cash by Seller to an account designated by Buyer or
otherwise credited against the Unadjusted Purchase Price (at Closing) pursuant
to Section 10.1. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
6.5(a)(iii) or 6.5(a)(v)(A) then Seller shall pay to 
Buyer (i) $500,000 _plus_ (ii) the amount of all Easement Amendment
Payment funds that have not been spent by Seller in accordance with this
Section 6.2 or otherwise irrevocably committed to the landowner or broker
related to such Easement Amendment, in cash to an account specified by Buyer.

 



13 (d) From and after the date hereof, until Closing, Seller will obtain
extensions and renewals (the terms of such extensions and renewals being
described on Schedule 6.2(d)) of the contracts and agreements described on
Schedule 6.2(d) (such extensions, the "Required Contract Extensions, Renewals
and Executions"). Buyer will reimburse Seller for all reasonable, documented,
third-party costs and expenses that are incurred by Seller in obtaining the
Required Contract Extensions, Renewals and Executions. Seller will keep Buyer
reasonably informed with respect to its progress in obtaining the Required
Contract Extensions, Renewals and Executions under this Section 6.2(d).

 

Section 6.3 _Restrictions on Certain Actions_

 

From the date hereof until Closing (or, with respect to any Retained Easement
and Properties, until the Retained Easement Closing with respect thereto or
the consummation of an Alternative Transaction, whichever is later), Seller
will conduct its business and operations relating to the Properties (or, as
applicable, the Retained Easements and Properties) in the Ordinary Course of
Business and will not, without Buyers prior written consent:

(a) sell, lease, transfer, abandon or otherwise dispose of any portion of
the Properties (or, as applicable, the Retained Easements and Properties);

(b) cause the Properties (or, as applicable, the Retained Easements and
Properties) to be subject to any lien, encumbrance, pledge, or mortgage other
than the Seller Lien (which shall be released at Closing);

 

(c) enter into any amendment of any Easements, Permits, Warranties or
Transferred Contracts (or, as applicable, the Retained Easements
and Properties) except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and except
for the New Antero Agreement;

(d) (i) take any action that would cause any representation or warranty of
Seller in this Agreement to be or become untrue, (ii) omit to take any action
necessary to prevent any such representation or warranty from being untrue or
(iii) take any action that would or could be reasonably expected to result in
the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 to be satisfied;
or

 

(e) agree, commit, authorize, or resolve to do any of the foregoing actions
set forth in clauses (a) though (d) of this Section 6.3.

Section 6.4 _Third Party Consents_

 

(a) Seller will request, from the appropriate parties (and in accordance with
the documents creating such rights and/or requirements), the Consents or
waivers of requirements that Consents be obtained, which are identified (or
should be identified) in Exhibit 4.5. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such Consents and/or waivers. Upon the Closing,
Seller shall turn over to Buyer its files relating to its efforts to obtain
such Consents and shall retain copies of such files and from and after Closing
until the six month anniversary thereof, Seller shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure such Consents.

 



14 (b) If Seller is unable to obtain any Consent prior to Closing, then (i) the
Easement to which such Consent relates and, except for any related Permits,
all other Properties related to such Easement (the "Retained Easements and
Properties") shall not be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing, (ii) the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by the aggregate
Consent Properties Allocated Values of the Retained Easements and Properties
(the "Consent Escrow Amount") and (iii) and the Parties and the Escrow Agent
shall enter into the Escrow Agreement (which Escrow Agreement shall include,
among other customary terms and provisions, provisions providing (A) that upon
the consummation of a Retained Easement Closing, a portion of the Consent
Escrow Amount equal to the aggregate Consent Properties Allocated Values
attributable to the Retained Easements and Properties being assigned to Buyer
at such Retained Easement Closing be released to Seller and (B) that upon the
consummation of an Alternative Transaction, the remainder of the Consent
Escrow Amount then held by the Escrow Agent be released to Seller). At the
Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Consent Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement. During
the six (6) month period following the Closing, Seller shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any outstanding Consents with
respect to the Retained Easements and Properties and if and when any such
Consents are obtained by Seller, Seller shall assign the Retained Easements
and Properties to which the obtained Consent relates to Buyer pursuant to a
conveyance that is substantially similar to the Conveyances delivered at
Closing (the conveyance of such Retained Easements and Properties to Buyer, a
"Retained Easement Closing"), and Buyer shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay
Seller the Consent Properties Allocated Value of each Retained Easement that
is conveyed to Buyer. If, as of the date that is six (6) months following the
Closing, any Consents remain outstanding with respect to any Retained
Easements and Properties then, at Buyers option, (i) Parent and Buyer will in
good faith negotiate the terms and conditions of, and enter into, an
agreement that provides for either (A) the sale of the equity interests in
Seller, after giving effect to the conveyance of the Excluded Assets to Parent
(or an affiliate thereof) (the "Entity Sale") or (B) a multi-survivor or
divisional merger of Seller and Buyer (the "Merger" and together with the
Entity Sale, each, an "Alternative Transaction") pursuant to the
Texas Business Organizations Code, as amended (the "TBOC"), and as defined by
TBOC Section 1.002(55), which will result in (1) Seller surviving the Merger
and being vested with all of the Excluded Assets (and all Damages
associated therewith) and (2) either Buyer surviving the Merger (in the
situation where a Merger as described in TBOC Section 1.002(55)(B) is
consummated) or a newly formed limited liability company wholly-owned by Buyer
surviving the Merger (in the situation where a Merger as described in TBOC
Section 1.002(55)(A) is consummated) and Buyer (or such newly formed limited
liability company, as applicable) being vested with all of the Retained
Easements and Properties (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no other
properties and no liabilities, obligations or Damages other than these related
to the Properties and for which Buyer has agreed (in this Agreement) to be
liable), it being acknowledged and agreed that terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Survival Periods,
which shall be deemed to have commenced as of the Closing Date, in Section
15.1 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the terms of such agreement providing
for the Entity Sale or the Merger, or (ii) Buyer shall direct the Escrow
Agent to pay the Seller the balance of the Consent Escrow Amount (in which
case, Seller shall assign the Retained Easements and Properties with respect
to which Consents remain outstanding to Buyer pursuant to a conveyance that
is substantially similar to the Conveyance). Upon the closing of the
transactions contemplated by an Alternative Transaction, Buyer shall direct
the Escrow Agent to pay the Seller the balance of the Consent Escrow Amount.
Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that, for federal and state
income Tax purposes, Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Consent Escrow
Amount and any interest or other income earned with respect to the Consent
Escrow Amount shall be treated as income of Buyer until the Consent Escrow
Amount is released upon final disbursement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and
agree that any disbursement of the Consent Escrow Amount to Seller shall be
treated as a payment to which the installment sale provisions of Section 453
of the Code apply.

 



15 Section 6.5 _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by:

 

(i) the mutual written consent of the Parties;

 

(ii) either Party, upon written notice to the other Party, if the Closing will
not have occurred (or becomes permanently incapable of occurring) on or
before the Termination Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 6.5(a)(ii) will not be available to a Party if
its breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the principal cause of
the Closing failing to occur on or before such date;

(iii) Buyer (so long as Seller, at such time, does not have a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(iv)) upon Sellers (A)
breach of any of its representations or warranties or (B) failure to comply
with any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, other than the
covenants contained in Section 6.2, _provided_ that Seller has not wilfully or
in bad faith failed to perform such covenants, in each case, which breach or
failure (1) would give rise to either of the conditions to Closing set forth
in Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(b) not being satisfied by, or becoming incapable of
being satisfied by, the Termination Date and (2) either (I) cannot reasonably
be cured prior to the Termination Date or (II) if such breach or failure can
reasonably be cured, it has not been cured prior to the first to occur of (x)
5:00 p.m. Central Time on the date that is twenty (20) days following receipt
by Seller of written notice of such breach and (y) 5:00 p.m. Central Time on
the date immediately preceding the Termination Date;

(iv) Seller (so long as Buyer, at such time, does not have a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(iii)) upon Buyers (A)
breach of any of its representations or warranties or (B) failure to comply
with any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, in each case, which
breach or failure (1) would give rise to either of the conditions to Closing
set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) not being satisfied by, or becoming
incapable of being satisfied by, the Termination Date and (2) either (I)
cannot reasonably be cured prior to the Termination Date or (II) if such
breach or failure can reasonably be cured, it has not been cured prior to the
first to occur of (x) 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the date that is twenty (20)
days following receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach and (y) 5:00
p.m. Central Time on the date immediately preceding the Termination Date, it

have willfully or in bad faith breached its obligation to obtain any Easement
Amendment in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2 solely by virtue of

amounts that exceed $5 million (inclusive of the Easement Amendment Payment).

affiliates or any of its or their representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(a) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding
any transaction that is similar to the transaction contemplated hereby (or
that otherwise involves, directly or indirectly, the Properties) (any
such transaction, a "Competing Transaction"), (b) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person or entity
concerning a possible Competing Transaction or (c) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding a Competing
Transaction. Seller shall immediately cease (and cause to be terminated), and
shall cause its affiliates and all of its and their representatives to

Article VII.

_Due Diligence Examination_

Section 7.1 _Assertion of Title Defects_

 

Buyer may, to the extent it deems appropriate, conduct, at its sole cost,
title, environmental, or other examination or investigation as it may choose
to conduct with respect to the Properties. Should, as a result of such
examination and investigation or otherwise, matters come to Buyers attention
which would constitute one or more Title Defects (as defined below in Section
7.2(a)) or Environmental Defects (as defined below in Section 7.2(b)) then the
Parties may resolve such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as applicable,
as follows:

 

(a) Should there be one or more of such Title Defects which Buyer determines
it is unwilling to waive, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such Title
Defects on or before 5 p.m. Mountain Time on the third (3) business day prior
to Closing (the "Defect Date"). Such notice must state for each Title Defect
the reduction proposed by Buyer to the Purchase Price for such Title Defect.
Such Title Defects of which Buyer so provides notice are herein called
"Asserted Title Defects." In the event that Buyer so notifies Seller of any
Asserted Title Defect, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation)
to attempt to cure such Asserted Title Defect to the reasonable satisfaction
of Buyer prior to the date that is no later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing. All matters that could constitute a Title Defect that are
not Asserted Title Defects are waived by Buyer.

(b) Should there be one or more Environmental Defects which Buyer determines
it is unwilling to waive, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such
Environmental Defects no later than the Defect Date. Such Environmental
Defects of which Buyer so provides notice are herein called "Asserted
Environmental Defects". In the event that Buyer so notifies Seller of any
Asserted Environmental Defect, Seller shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to attempt to cure such Asserted Environmental Defect to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer prior to Closing. All matters that could
constitute an Environmental Defect that are not Asserted Environmental Defects
are waived by Buyer.

Section 7.2  _Defects Defined_

The term "Defect" as used in this Article VII shall mean a "Title Defect" or
an "Environmental Defect."

 



17 (a) A "Title Defect" means that (i) Sellers title to and ownership of an
Easement is such that it does not entitle Seller (or, immediately after
Closing, will not entitle Buyer) to construct, own, operate, maintain, repair
or use all or any portion of the AGS North Pipeline or the Expansion System,
_provided_  that the taking or condemnation, after the date hereof, of an
Easement under Applicable Laws shall not constitute a Title Defect, or (ii)
Sellers ownership of the Easements is subject to a lien, encumbrance,
mortgage or similar security interest other than (A) a lien for current
period taxes not yet due or delinquent, (B) a mechanics or materialmens lien
(or other similar lien) for pre-Effective Date liabilities, to the extent the
same relates to expenses incurred which are not yet due and which Seller
agrees in a writing will be paid by Seller in full and promptly when due, (C)
a lien or other encumbrance created by the grantor of an Easement or the
predecessors in interest of such grantor prior to the grant of such Easement
to Seller, or (D) the Seller Lien. The fact that a particular Easement
Property is subject to a third party Consent shall not constitute a Title
Defect with respect to such Easement Property. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that a "Title Defect"
shall include the existence of any fact or other matter that causes the
following to be true: (A) the AGS North Pipeline (and all other Properties
that are "in service") are not located entirely within or on property covered
by a Basic Document and (B) one or more gaps exist in any of the Easements or
Permits located along the route shown on the map attached hereto as Exhibit
A.

(b) An "Environmental Defect" is a Property or operation with respect to a
Property that (i) is in violation of any applicable Environmental Laws, (ii)
has been in violation of or otherwise not in compliance with any applicable
Environmental Laws and has not otherwise been remediated or corrected in
accordance with or as necessary to achieve compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws, or (iii) otherwise causes liability under applicable
Environmental Laws. An "Environmental Defect" does not include any matter
disclosed on Exhibit 4.9.

 

Section 7.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments_

 

If Asserted Title Defects or Asserted Environmental Defects are presented to
Seller on or before the Defect Date and Seller is unable (or unwilling) to
cure such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect to Buyers
reasonable satisfaction before Closing, then:

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to agree upon a reduction in
the Purchase Price to account for such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect in the following manner:

(i) for any Asserted Title Defect relating to the AGS North Pipeline, the
amount of reduction shall be equal to (A) the costs and expenses incurred in
replacing the Easement that is subject to the Asserted Title Defect with an
equivalent Easement or an equivalent replacement Easement, (B) the costs and
expenses associated with relocating any pipeline or other Properties located
on the Easement subject to the Asserted Title Defect (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any costs and expenses incurred in any associated
interruption in service on such pipeline or other Properties and/or (C) in
the case of a Title Defect resulting from a lien or encumbrance that is
liquidated in amount, the amount necessary to obtain or release the applicable
lien or encumbrance from the Asserted Title Defect Easement;

 

(ii) for any Asserted Title Defect relating to the Expansion System, the
amount of reduction shall be equal to (A) the least amount necessary to
obtain corrective action such that the matter would no longer be a Title
Defect, (B) to the extent applicable, the necessary costs and expenses
incurred in redesigning (or otherwise modifying) the pipeline development
and construction plan with respect to the Expansion System (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any actual costs and expenses incurred in any re-
permitting activities and/or in conducting any environmental studies or
assessments, but excluding any incidental or consequential damages relating
thereto), (C) to the extent applicable, the costs incurred in replacing the
Easement that is subject to the Asserted Title Defect with an equivalent
Easement or an equivalent replacement Easement and/or (D) in the case of a
Title Defect resulting from a lien or encumbrance that is liquidated in
amount, the amount necessary to obtain or release the applicable lien or
encumbrance from the Asserted Title Defect Easement;

 



18 (iii) for any Asserted Environmental Defect the amount of reduction shall be
equal to the amount of any fines, payments, charges or penalties that could
reasonably be expected to be imposed by a Governmental Authority against Buyer
under applicable Environmental Laws, including the cost to investigate and
remediate the Property (or applicable portion thereof), if remediation is
required; and

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Allocation and the Consent Properties
Allocated Values may be considered in (but shall not be determinative of) the
calculation of the amount of the reduction to the Purchase Price attributable
to any Asserted Title Defect or any Asserted Environmental Defect.

(b) If the Unadjusted Purchase Price reduction which would result from this
Article VII with respect to all Asserted Title Defects does not exceed one
percent (1%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price ("Title Deductible"), then no
adjustment of the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall occur. If such reductions
for Asserted Title Defects exceed the Title Deductible the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amount by which such reduction exceeds
the Title Deductible. If the Unadjusted Purchase Price reduction which would
result from this Article VII with respect to all Asserted Environmental
Defects does not exceed one percent (1%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
("Environmental Deductible"), then no adjustment of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall occur. If such reductions for Asserted Environmental Defects
exceed the Environmental Deductible the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted by the amount by which such reduction exceeds the Environmental
Deductible.

 

(c) If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree prior to the Closing, upon an
appropriate reduction with respect to any Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect (or the validity of either), the amount of such reduction
for such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect shall be
determined post-Closing by arbitration in accordance with Article XIV.

 

(d) For each Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect (as
applicable) (i) for which notice was given by Buyer on or before the Defect
Date, (ii) that Seller has not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer
prior to Closing, and (iii) for which the associated reduction has been agreed
or determined prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
at Closing by the agreed or determined reduction for such Asserted Title
Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect (as applicable).

(e) For each Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect (i) for
which notice was given by Buyer on or before the Defect Date, (ii) that Seller
has not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer prior to Closing, and
(iii) for which the validity of or associated reduction has not been agreed
or determined prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing
by Buyers reasonable proposed reduction for such Asserted Title Defect or
Asserted Environmental Defect (as applicable).

(f) If, after the completion of the arbitration regarding any Asserted Defect
for which the Purchase Price was reduced pursuant to Section 7.3(e), the
reduction determined by the arbitrator(s) with respect to such Asserted Defect
exceeds Buyers reasonable proposed reduction for such Asserted Defect, Seller
shall pay Buyer within five (5) business days after the completion of such
arbitration an amount equal to (i) the reduction determined by the arbitrator
for such Asserted Defect _minus_ (ii) Buyers reasonable proposed reduction
for such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect.

 



19 (g) If, after the completion of the arbitration regarding any Asserted Title
Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect for which the Purchase Price was
reduced pursuant to Section 7.3(e), the reductions determined by the
arbitrator(s) with respect to such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted
Environmental Defect is less than Buyers reasonable proposed reduction for
such Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect, Buyer shall pay
Seller within five (5) business days after the completion of such arbitration
an amount equal to (i) Buyers reasonable proposed reduction for such
Asserted Title Defect or Asserted Environmental Defect _minus_ (ii) the
reduction determined by the arbitrator for such Asserted Title Defect or
Asserted Environmental Defect.

 

Section 7.4 _Termination for Identified Defects_

 

If the (i) the aggregate reduction agreed pursuant to Section 7.3(a) in the
Purchase Price for all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Environmental
Defects, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate of Buyers reasonable proposed reductions
in the Purchase Price for all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted
Environmental Defects, the reductions for which have not been agreed by Buyer
and Seller or determined by arbitration prior to Closing, exceed (in each
case, as determined without giving effect to the Title Deductible or the
Environmental Deductible) fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by
delivery of written notice thereof to the other Party.

 

Section 7.5 _Casualty Loss_

 

If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date all or any
portion of the Properties is destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, earthquake,
storm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage, accident or other
casualty of a similar nature or shall be taken by condemnation or under the
right of eminent domain (all of which are herein called "Casualty Loss"), and
the aggregate loss to the Properties as a result of such Casualty Loss exceeds
ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer, and Buyer shall have the right to elect (such election being in
its sole and absolute discretion) by written notice to Seller prior to Closing
to terminate this Agreement or, in the absence of such election, shall proceed
to close and, by written notice to Seller prior to the Closing either: (i)
to cause the Properties affected by such casualty or taking to be repaired or
restored to at least its condition prior to such casualty or taking (if
practicable), at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(which work may extend after the Closing Date so long as such work is being
done and continues to be done in a diligent manner), (ii) to enter into an
indemnity agreement with Seller to indemnify Buyer through a document
reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer against any costs or expenses that
Buyer reasonably incurs to repair the Properties subject to such casualty or
taking, (iii) to accept an assignment from Seller to Buyer of all rights to
insurance, condemnation awards and other claims Seller may have against third
parties with respect to the casualty or taking or (iv), if mutually agreed by
Seller and Buyer, to adjust the Purchase Price.

Purchase Price shall be made between Buyer and Seller so that:

(a) all operating expenses and capital costs (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Asset Taxes and Income Taxes) that are incurred in the operation
of the Properties on or after the Effective Date will be borne by Buyer, and
all proceeds and revenues which are attributable to the Properties (including
without limitation the performance of the Transferred Contracts) with respect
to the period on or after the Effective Date will be received by Buyer;

(b) operating expenses and capital costs (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Asset Taxes and Income Taxes) that are incurred in the operation of

Price at Closing; and

(d) the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer in accordance
with Section 10.3(b) are paid or otherwise economically borne by Buyer, and
the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller in accordance with Section
10.3(b) are paid or otherwise economically borne by Seller, such that
the Unadjusted Purchase Price is increased by the amount of all Asset Taxes

to Buyer, based upon the best information then reasonably available to
Seller, a statement reflecting the amount of the adjustments expressly
provided for in this Agreement, including in Section 3.1, Section 6.4 and
Section 10.1 and Article VII. If the amount of adjustments so determined
which would result in a credit to Buyer exceed the amount of adjustments so
determined which would result in a credit to Seller, the Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount of such excess, and, if the converse is
true, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such
excess.

(b) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing ("Post Close
Settlement Date"), Buyer and Seller shall review any additional information
which may then be available pertaining to the adjustments expressly provided
for in this Agreement, including in Section 3.1, Section 6.4 and Section 10.1
and Article VII, shall determine if any additional adjustments (whether the
same be made to account for expenses or revenues not considered in making the
adjustments made at Closing, or to correct errors made in such adjustments)
should be made beyond those made at Closing, and shall make any such
adjustments by appropriate payments from Seller to Buyer or from Buyer to
Seller, as applicable, within ten (10) days of the Post Close Settlement
Date.

by appropriate payments from Buyer to Seller or from Seller to Buyer within
ten (10) days of the discovery of such adjustments.

 

Section 10.3 _Tax Matters_

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties understand and expect that the sale of the
Properties contemplated by this Agreement should be exempt from Pennsylvania
sales and use Taxes as an isolated transaction pursuant to 72 P.S. § 7204(1).
To the extent that any Transfer Taxes are due with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties agree to be equally responsible
for such Transfer Taxes, and each Party shall indemnify and hold the other
Party (and its affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, contractors and agents) harmless, for its share of any and
all such Transfer Taxes. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with each other
in demonstrating that the requirements for any applicable exemptions from or
reductions to Transfer Taxes have been met.

Date.

(ii) For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section
10.3(b)(i), (1) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts or imposed on a transactional basis shall be allocated to the period
in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred and (2)
Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the Effective Date
by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period that occur before the Effective Date, on the one hand, and
the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the
Effective Date, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (2) of the preceding
sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on which
ownership of the applicable Properties gives rise to liability for the
particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

(iii) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not determinable at
the time an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is to be made with
respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to Sections 10.1 or 10.2, as applicable,
(1) the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in
estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment, and
(2) upon the later determination of the actual amount of such Asset Tax,
timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent
necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is
allocable to such Party under this 
Section 10.3(b).

 

(iv) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, and at the requesting Partys reasonable
expense, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Asset Taxes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the control and conduct of any
audit or judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to Asset Taxes
that is a third party claim shall be governed by Section 11.2.

 



25 (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all Income Taxes incurred
by or imposed on Seller, its direct or indirect owners or affiliates, or any
combined, unitary, or consolidated group of which any of the foregoing is or
was a member, and no such Taxes shall be taken into account as adjustments to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Sections 10.1 or 10.2.

(c)  _Certain Other Tax Matters_. As soon as practicable, but not later than
10 days prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) provide the Pennsylvania Department
of Revenue with written notice of the planned transfer of assets pursuant to
this Agreement to Buyer and (ii) request the issuance of a certificate
showing that all state taxes have been paid by Seller for all periods up to
and including the transfer date and all tax reports have been filed by Seller
for all periods up to and including the transfer date, each as described in

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall, from
and after the Closing, indemnify, defend and hold each Buyer Indemnitee
harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by such
Buyer Indemnitee arising out or relating to (i) a breach of any covenant,
agreement and obligation of Seller set forth in this Agreement (except for
the covenants of Seller in Section 8.3(a)), (ii) for the breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this Agreement (or any
certificate delivered by Seller at Closing) for which written notice is
received by Seller from Buyer within the applicable Survival Period, (iii)
the matters disclosed on, or that are required to be disclosed on Exhibit 4.6,
Exhibit 4.8 and Exhibit 4.9 (for the representation and warranties in Sections
4.6, 4.8 and 4.9 to be true and correct) and (iv) Damages suffered or
incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee arising out of or relating to third party
claims brought against Buyer (which shall exclude claims by affiliates of
Buyer or claims by Buyers successors and assigns) with respect to the
Retained Obligations. Sellers indemnity under this Section 11.1(a) shall not
cover or include any matters pertaining to title to the Properties or
environmental matters, including Title Defects and Environmental Defects,
which will be governed exclusively by Article VII hereof.

(b) Buyer shall, from and after the Closing, assume, indemnify, defend and
hold each Seller Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all Damages
suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee arising out of or relating to
(i) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer set forth in
this Agreement (except for the covenants of Buyer in Section 8.3(b)) and (ii)

Seller under this Section 11.1(b) for any Damages to the extent Seller is
obligated to indemnify Buyer for such Damages pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or
Section 13.1 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

(c) THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATIONS SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DUTIES,
OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION,
LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE
(INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE
OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE) OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR (ii) STRICT LIABILITY.

 



26 Section 11.2 _Notice of Claim_

 

If indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1 is sought, within the Survival
Periods specified herein, then the person seeking or claiming indemnification
(the "Indemnitee") shall give written notice to the indemnifying Party of the
event giving rise to the obligation to indemnify, describing in reasonable
detail the factual basis for such claim, and if such claim or action is by a
third party, allow the indemnifying Party to assume and diligently conduct the
defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, and cooperate with the indemnifying Party in the defense thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume control of the defense of any claim or action to the extent the claim
or action, individually or in the aggregate with any other claim or action,
involves potential Damages that exceed the amount of the indemnification
available under this Agreement. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
separate counsel to represent the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee is advised by
counsel that an actual conflict of interest makes it advisable for the
Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel and the reasonable expenses
and fees of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying Party. An
indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, (i) settle any claim or action or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written
release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such claim or
action or (ii) settle any claim or action or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely
affects the Indemnitee (other than as a result of money damages covered by
the indemnity).

Section 11.3 _Limits on Indemnification_

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI,

 

(a) in no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify or hold Buyer
Indemnitees harmless (i) under Section 11.1(a)(ii) of this Agreement for an
aggregate amount in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price; or (ii) under Section 11.1(a)(i), Section 11.1(a)(iii) or Section
11.1(a)(iv) for an aggregate amount in excess of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price; and

(b) Seller shall be obligated to indemnify and hold Buyer Indemnitees
harmless under this Agreement only for claims and Damages with respect to
which notice is received by Seller from Buyer within the applicable Survival
Period.

Section 14.1 _Selection of Arbitrators_

 

Except for disputes with respect to the Allocation (which shall be resolved in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(b)) and except for the matters
described in Section 15.8, any dispute or controversy with respect to this
Agreement shall be finally resolved by a board of arbitration in accordance
with the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, with depositions limited to two (2) per
Party, and shall be administered by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association. A Party desiring arbitration shall give a
written notice to the other, which notice shall name a qualified, impartial,
and independent arbitrator. Within ten (10) days after the receipt of such
notice, the other Party shall name a qualified, impartial, and independent
arbitrator, or failing to do so, the Party giving notice shall name the
second. Within ten (10) days after sending the original notice of submission,
the two arbitrators so appointed shall name the third qualified, independent
arbitrator, or failing to do so, the third arbitrator may be appointed by the
American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules (with the panel
so picked being the "Arbitrators").

 

Section 14.2 _Determination_

 

The Arbitrators selected to act hereunder shall be qualified by education and
experience to pass on the particular question in dispute and must have at
least ten (10) years experience in the gas pipeline industry. The arbitration
shall be conducted in Harris County, Texas. The Arbitrators shall promptly

any award of attorneys fees, costs, or expenses, nor any damages prohibited
pursuant to Section 15.16. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
arbitration proceedings and award shall be maintained in confidence by the
Parties. If any part or provision of this dispute resolution clause is invalid

such covenant is otherwise specified in this Agreement), (e) (i) the covenants
to indemnify set forth in Section 11.1(a) (other than the covenant set forth
in Sections 11.1(a)(i) (as described above in Section 15.1(d)), (a)(ii) and
(a)(iv)), and (ii) the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyances,
shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months and (f) the

expiration of the applicable Survival Period with respect to any matter of

notice as provided in Section 11.2 prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period.

Section 15.2  _Exclusive Remedy_

agreements contained in this Agreement that survives the Closing, (ii) other

relating to the purchase and sale of the Properties as contemplated hereby,
in each case, shall be any right to Sellers payment, indemnification or other
or other rights under Article X, Article XI, Article XIII and otherwise in
this Agreement (or any other Transaction Document). If no such rights under
Article X, Article XI and/or Article XIII for such claims are expressly
provided therein or otherwise in this Agreement (or any other Transaction
Document), then, from and after Closing such claim (other than any
claim contemplated by Section 15.2(d)) shall be waived and released to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 



30 (c) If the Closing does not occur due to a breach by either Seller or Buyer
(that occurred prior to the termination of this Agreement) of any covenant or
agreement applicable to such breaching Party, then the non-breaching Party
shall have all remedies available to it under Applicable Law with respect to
such termination. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
provision does not limit or otherwise modify the Parties rights to specific
performance (pursuant to Section 15.8).

 

(d) The terms of this Section 15.2 and Section 15.6 shall not be applicable to
the extent that a Party has committed actual fraud or willful misconduct.

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be taken all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to the extent that the fulfillment of such conditions is
within the control of such Party. After the Closing, Seller shall execute and
deliver, and shall otherwise cause to be executed and delivered, from time to
time, such further documents (including additional original Conveyances), and
do such further acts and things, as may be reasonably necessary to more fully
and effectively grant, convey and assign the Properties to Buyer.

Section 15.4  _Binding Effect; Successors and Assigns_

The Agreement shall be binding on the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the right to
assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other Party first having been obtained; _provided_ ,
that Buyer shall have the unconditional right to assign to any of its
affiliates its right to receive any or all of the Properties at Closing.

Section 15.5  _Expenses_

Except as expressly set forth herein, each Party shall bear and pay all
expenses incurred by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 15.6 _Entire Agreement; Time of the Essence_

 

This Agreement, the Conveyances, the Transition Services Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents contain the entire understanding of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, and discussions among the Parties with respect
to such subject matter. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 

Section 15.7 _Public Statements_

 

Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to any publicity
and other releases at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except as required by Applicable Law or
the applicable rules or regulations of any governmental body or stock
exchange, prior to Closing, neither Party shall issue any publicity or other
release without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

Section 15.8 _Injunctive Relief_  

The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur
if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement (without any obligation to post a bond or prove actual
damages), and shall be entitled to enforce specifically this Agreement, in
the courts of Harris County, Texas.

 



31 Section 15.9 _Amendments_

 

This Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented, restated or discharged
(and provisions hereof may be waived) only by an instrument in writing signed
by Buyer and Seller (or, in the case of a waiver, signed by the Party to be
charged with the waiver thereof).

 

Section 15.10 _Governing Law_

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Texas without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles thereof that would otherwise require the application of the law of
any other jurisdiction, except that matters involving real property law shall
be governed by the laws of Pennsylvania. The exclusive venue and jurisdiction
for the enforcement of the matters described in Section 15.8 shall be the
federal or state courts in Harris County, Texas. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to be subject to such venue and jurisdiction in Harris
County, Texas and acknowledges that said county is the exclusive court for
venue and jurisdictional purposes with respect to such matters.

 

Section 15.11 _Multiple Counterparts; Fax_

 

This instrument may be executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of
which for all purposes is to be deemed an original, and all of which
constitute collectively, one instrument. It is not necessary that each Party
execute the same counterpart so long as identical counterparts are executed by
each such Party. This instrument may be validly executed and delivered by
facsimile or other electronic transmission. This Agreement shall not be
binding upon any Party unless and until it has been executed by Seller and
Buyer.

 

Section 15.12 _Exhibits_

 

Each Exhibit attached hereto is incorporated herein by reference for all
purposes and references to this Agreement shall also include such Exhibit
unless the context in which used shall otherwise require.

Section 15.13 _Joint Preparation_

 

This Agreement shall be considered for all purposes as prepared through the
joint efforts of the Parties and shall not be construed against one Party or
the other as a result of the preparation or submittal of any provision hereof
by any Party.

Section 15.14  _Severability_

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision to any
person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially (or by arbitration) to
be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect of
invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent
and agreement of the Parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended to
modify such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and
enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not
possible, by substituting therefore another provision that is valid,
legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.
