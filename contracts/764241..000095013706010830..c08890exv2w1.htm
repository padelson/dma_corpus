 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 5, 2006 ("Agreement"), is made by and among Integra Bank Corporation, an Indiana corporation ("Integra"), PFC Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integra ("Sub"), and Prairie Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Prairie"). 

  

 WHEREAS, Integra is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), and is the owner of all of the outstanding capital stock of Integra Bank National Association, a national banking association ("Integra Bank"). 

  

 WHEREAS, Prairie is registered as a bank holding company under the BHCA and is the owner of all of the outstanding capital stock of Prairie Bank and Trust Company, an Illinois banking corporation ("Prairie Bank"). 

  

 WHEREAS, Integra and Prairie have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Prairie to merge with Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, Prairie has received the opinion of Hovde Financial, Inc., its financial advisors, that the consideration to be paid to stockholders of Prairie pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that immediately after the Merger becomes effective, Prairie Bank shall merge with and into Integra Bank (the "Bank Merger"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Integra, Sub and Prairie have each approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE MERGER AND THE BANK MERGER_   

  

 _Section 1.1 Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 below), Prairie and Sub will merge with Prairie as the resulting or surviving corporation ("Surviving Corporation") and the separate corporate existence of Sub will thereupon cease in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Integra may at any time change the method of effecting the combination with Prairie (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article I) if and to the extent it reasonably deems such change to be desirable, including, without limitation, to provide for Sub to become the Surviving Corporation, to provide for the merger of the Surviving Corporation into Integra or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integra as a condition to the opinion contemplated in Section 7.2(d) or to change the effective time of the Bank Merger; provided, however, that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Prairie Common Stock"), of Prairie as provided for in this Agreement, (B) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (C) would result in any material adverse tax consequences to Prairie stockholders not expressly contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 1.2 Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 6.1), Integra and Prairie shall cause a certificate of merger complying with the requirements of the DGCL to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger") specifying that the Merger will become effective at 11:59 p.m. (CDT) on the day on which the Closing Date occurs (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 _Section 1.3 Effect of Merger_. The Merger will have the effects specified in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Prairie will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Prairie and all of its rights, privileges, powers and franchises, public as well as private, and all its debts, liabilities and duties as a corporation organized under the DGCL, will continue unaffected by the Merger. 

  

 _Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with applicable law.

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES_   

  

 _Section 2.1 Conversion of Shares_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Prairie Common Stock not owned by Integra or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Integra, except for any such shares of Prairie Common Stock (i) held in the treasury of Prairie, or (ii) owned by Prairie stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal and payment for such shares pursuant to § 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive either (A) if and only if the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(d) with respect to the election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), are satisfied, 5.914 shares of common stock, stated value $1.00 per share and the related rights to purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no par value, which are attached to and trade with such shares ("Integra Common Stock"), of Integra (the "Per Share Stock Consideration") and $65.26 in cash; or (B) if the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(d) are not satisfied, 5.760 shares of Integra Common Stock (the "Adjusted Per Share Stock Consideration") and $63.57 in cash. The shares of Integra Common Stock and cash provided for in this Section 2.1(a) are referred to as the "Merger Consideration". 

   

 (b) Each holder of Prairie Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Integra Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share 

   ##### 

  

    

of Integra Common Stock multiplied by the Market Price (as defined in Section
8.6(a)(vi)). 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, each share of Prairie Common Stock held in Prairies treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of Prairie Common Stock owned by Integra or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Integra (except for any shares that are Trust Account Shares or Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and retired. 

   

 (e) Each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 _Section 2.2 Treatment of Stock Options_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, all rights under any stock option granted by Prairie or its predecessors pursuant to Prairies existing stock option plans (collectively, the "Prairie Option Plans") that remain outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the options referenced in Section 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) below ("Unexercised Options"), shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Prairie Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase Integra Common Stock ("Integra Substitute Options") in an amount and at an exercise price determined in this Section 2.2(a) and otherwise subject to the terms of the agreements evidencing the original grants of such options. The adjustments provided in this Section 2.2(a) with respect to Unexercised Options shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

   ##### 

  

    

Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price of the original
option. For purposes of this Section 2.2(b), the Integra Common Stock portion
of the Merger Consideration shall be valued at the Market Price. 

  

 _Section 2.3 Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Integra shall designate Integra Bank to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in connection with the Merger pursuant to an exchange agent agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this Section 2.3. Except as set forth herein, from and after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Prairie Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration for each share of Prairie Common Stock so represented by the Certificate surrendered by such holder thereof. The certificates representing shares of Integra Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration shall be properly issued and countersigned and executed and authenticated, as appropriate. 

   

 (b) _Notice of Exchange_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Integra shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail and/or make available to each record holder of a Certificate a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedures to be used in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereon, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the person entitled thereto the Merger Consideration for each share of Prairie Common Stock so represented by the Certificate surrendered by such holder thereof, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. 

   

 (c) _Transfer_. If delivery of all or part of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such delivery or exchange that the Certificate surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery or exchange shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such delivery or exchange in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) _Right to Merger Consideration_. Subject to Section 2.3(e) below, until surrendered and exchanged in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.3, each Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable to the holder of the shares of Prairie Common 

   ##### 

  

    

Stock evidenced by such Certificate, together with any dividends or
other distributions as provided in Sections 2.3(e) and 2.3(f) below, and
shall have no other rights. From and after the Effective Time, Integra shall
be entitled to treat such Certificates that have not yet been surrendered for
exchange as evidencing the right to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Prairie Common Stock represented by
such Certificates may be converted, notwithstanding any failure to surrender
such Certificates. One hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation or its
successor any shares of Integra Common Stock and funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) which Integra has made available to
the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation or its successor (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, cash
in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions, if any,
deliverable or payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Prairie Common Stock for any Merger Consideration (or
dividends, distributions or interest with respect thereto) delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. 

   

 (e) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Certificates_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Integra on Integra Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, provided that no dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Integra Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the share of Integra Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. The Surviving Corporation, or its successor, shall pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Prairie on Prairie Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such certificate is entitled as a result of the Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be 

   ##### 

  

    

made against Prairie, Integra or the Exchange Agent or any other party with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (g) _Voting With Respect to Unexchanged Certificates_. Holders of unsurrendered Certificates will not be entitled to vote at any meeting of Integra shareholders. 

   

 (h) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Integra Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate or Certificates. No dividends or distributions of Integra shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and any such fractional share interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of shareholders of Integra. In lieu of any such fractional shares, holders of Certificates otherwise entitled to fractional shares shall be entitled to receive promptly from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in an amount equal to the fraction of such share of Integra Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the Market Price. 

  

 _Section 2.4 Closing of Prairies Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Prairie shall be closed at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Prairie Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Prairie, the Merger Consideration to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement may be delivered to a transferee, if a Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes. Integra and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Prairie to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement for their shares of Prairie Common Stock, which books shall be conclusive with respect to the ownership of such shares. In the event of a dispute with respect to the ownership of any such shares, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration not already paid represented thereby in escrow with an independent party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims to such Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 2.5 Changes in Integra Common Stock_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Integra Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted proportionately such that the holders will receive the same amount of Integra Common Stock as if the Integra Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger had been outstanding at the record date for such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, or dividend. 

  

 _Section 2.6 Dissenters Rights_. No holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to the Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to this Article II unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal of such shares of Prairie Common Stock under § 262 of the DGCL, and any such stockholder shall be entitled 

   ##### 

  

    

to receive only the payment provided by § 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Dissenting Shares. If any Prairie stockholder who otherwise would be deemed
to hold Dissenting Shares shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any such
shares, such shares of Prairie Common Stock shall thereupon be treated
as though such shares of Prairie Common Stock had been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1. Prairie
shall give Integra (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable law received by Prairie relating to Prairies
rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal
under § 262 of the DGCL. Prairie shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Integra (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

accepted accounting practices, except as disclosed in the Integra Reports.
The reserves, the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and the
carrying value for real estate owned which are shown in Integras Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 are, to Integras
Knowledge, adequate in all respects under the requirements of
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and
safe and sound banking practices to provide for possible losses on items for
which reserves were made, loans and leases outstanding and real estate owned
as of the respective dates. 

   

 (b) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Integra Reports filed since August 29, 2002, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Integra have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct.

   #####

significant role in Integras internal control over financial reporting.

 (e) As of the date hereof, Integra has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting other than as disclosed in the Integra Reports. 

  

 _Section 3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Integra Reports filed by Integra with the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2005, there has not been any change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of Integra and its subsidiaries which has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 3.9 Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Integra Reports filed by Integra with the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of Integra, threatened against or affecting Integra or any of Integras subsidiaries which, if decided adversely to Integra, would be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Integra or any of Integras subsidiaries having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 3.10 Compliance with Laws and Orders_. Except as disclosed in the Integra Reports filed by Integra with the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, the businesses of Integra and its subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, order, decree, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, in the case of Integra Bank, all statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the banking business and the exercise of trust powers), except for violations which individually or in the aggregate do not, and would not reasonably be expected to, have a Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Integra or any of Integras subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Integra, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same in each case other than those, the outcome of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 3.11 Fees_. Except for fees paid and payable to Howe Barnes Hoefer and Arnett, neither Integra nor any of Integras subsidiaries has paid or will become obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 3.12 Agreements with Bank Regulators, Etc._ Neither Integra nor any Integra Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party

subject to any specific order or directive by, or is a recipient of any
extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Governmental Entity which
restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its management, nor
has Integra been advised by any Governmental Entity that such Governmental
Entity is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement,
memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment
letter or similar submission. 

  

 _Section 3.13 Approval Delays_. Integra knows of no reason why the granting of any of the regulatory approvals referred to in Section 3.6, would be denied or unduly delayed. Integra Bank is "well capitalized" in accordance with the Bank Regulations and will be "well capitalized" on a pro forma basis immediately following the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. The most recent CRA rating of Integra Bank is "Satisfactory" or better. 

  

 _Section 3.14 Financial Resources_. Integra will have sufficient cash available on the Closing Date to enable it to comply with its obligation to fund the Merger Consideration under Section 2.1 and to perform its other obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 3.15 [Reserved]_. 

  

 _Section 3.16 Notice of Breach or Potential Breach_. Integra shall promptly notify Prairie of any change, circumstance or event which would cause any of the representations or warranties made by Integra and Sub pursuant to this Agreement to be untrue as of the date hereof or at the Closing Date or which prevents Integra and Sub from complying with any of their obligations hereunder. To Integras Knowledge, there is no fact or development which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Integras or its subsidiaries continuing business, which has not been set forth in this Agreement.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PRAIRIE_

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 4.1 Corporate Organization_. Prairie is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Prairie is registered as a bank holding company under the BHCA. Prairie has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Prairie has heretofore delivered to Integra true and complete copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as currently in effect. 

  

 _Section 4.2 Authority_. Prairie has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, subject to the Required Prairie Vote (as defined in Section 4.16). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly approved by the Board of Directors of Prairie and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Prairie are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated other than the Required Prairie Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes valid and binding obligations of, Prairie, enforceable against Prairie in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought. 

  

 _Section 4.3 Capitalization_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Prairie consists of 700,000 shares of Prairie Common Stock and 10,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Prairie Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on October 4, 2006, 532,497 shares of Prairie Common Stock were validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and no shares of Prairie Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding.

Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, there are no stockholders agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary is a party with respect to the transfer or voting of the capital stock of Prairie. As of the date of this Agreement, there were outstanding under Prairie Option Plans, unexercised options (whether vested or unvested) to purchase an aggregate of 46,915 shares of Prairie Common Stock, for which adequate shares of Prairie Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under Prairie Option Plans. The Prairie Disclosure Letter sets forth for each of the outstanding unexercised options, the holder, the date of grant, the date of expiration and the exercise price. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 4.4 Subsidiaries_. The Prairie Disclosure Letter sets forth the name and state of incorporation of each subsidiary of Prairie (collectively, the "Prairie Subsidiaries" and each a "Prairie Subsidiary"). Prairie Bank is the only Prairie subsidiary which is a financial institution and it is a bank duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Illinois and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Each Prairie Subsidiary is a corporation or other business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or foreign business entity in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Prairie Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. All outstanding shares of capital stock of each Prairie Subsidiary is owned by Prairie or another Prairie Subsidiary and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, are not subject to preemptive rights and are owned free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, convertible securities or any other agreements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any Prairie Subsidiary obligating any Prairie Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of its capital stock or obligating any Prairie Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, option, warrant, right, convertible security or other similar agreement or commitment.

The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 _Section 4.6 Consent and Approvals; No Violation_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Prairie nor the consummation by Prairie of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, (b) violate, conflict with, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any lien or other encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary is a party or to which they or any of their respective properties or assets are subject, except for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of liens or other encumbrances which will not 

   ##### 

  

    

have a Material Adverse Effect or (c) require on the part of Prairie any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of or from, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) filing the Delaware
Certificate of Merger, (ii) filings with, and, if necessary, approval by the
FRB, the OCC and the State Agency, or (iii) consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits, filings or notifications which, if not obtained or
made will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

 _Section 4.7 Financial Information_. Prairie has previously furnished Integra with true and complete copies of the audited consolidated balance sheets of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and related consolidated income statements and statements of changes in stockholders equity and of cash flows for the three (3) years ended December 31, 2005, together with the notes thereto, and the unaudited, consolidated balance sheets of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and the related unaudited consolidated income statements and statement of changes in stockholders equity for the six months then ended (together, the "Prairie Financial Statements").

The books and records of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries since January 1, 2001 have been, and are being, maintained in accordance with generally applied accounting principles and all other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. There exist no material liabilities of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, of a type required to be disclosed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, except as disclosed in the Prairie Financial Statements. To the Knowledge of Prairie, there is no fact or circumstance that would indicate that Prairie will not be able to comply with the audit, recordkeeping and management review of internal controls requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") as of December 31, 2006. 

  

 _Section 4.8 Taxes_.

Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, Prairie and each Prairie Subsidiary have prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed, or caused to be duly and timely filed, Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or before the date hereof, except to the extent that all such failures to file, taken together, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, Prairie and each Prairie Subsidiary have paid, or have made adequate provision or set up an adequate accrual or reserve for the payment of, all Taxes shown or required to be shown to be owing on all such Tax Returns, together with any interest, additions or penalties related to any such Taxes or to any open taxable year or period. 

    ##### 

 

    

 (b) Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, neither Prairie nor any of Prairies Subsidiaries has consented to extend the statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of any Tax. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, neither Prairie nor any of Prairie Subsidiaries is a party to any action, audit or proceeding, nor to the Knowledge of Prairie is any such action or proceeding threatened, by any Governmental Entity in connection with the determination, assessment or collection of any Taxes, and no deficiency notices or reports have been received by Prairie or any of Prairie Subsidiaries in respect of any material deficiencies for any Tax, assessment, or government charge. 

   

 (c) During the period commencing January 1, 1999, and ending on the close of business on the Closing Date (the "S Period"), Prairie has been an "S corporation" within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the Code, and a valid election under Section 1362 of the Code has been in effect with respect to Prairie at all times for the S Period. A valid S election or similar election has been in effect with respect to Prairie during the S Period in all relevant state and local jurisdictions in which Prairie is subject to Tax and in which such election is required. Each of Prairies stockholders has been a Person described in Section 1361(b)(1)(B) of the Code at all times that such Person held shares of Prairie Common Stock during the S Period, and at no time during the S Period was any stockholder of Prairie a non-resident alien. 

   

 (d) During the S Period, Prairie Bank was a qualified subchapter S subsidiary ("QSub"), and a valid election under Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code has been in effect with respect to Prairie Bank at all times for such period. A valid QSub election or similar election has been in effect with respect to Prairie Bank during such period in all relevant state and local jurisdictions in which Prairie is subject to Tax and in which such election is required. 

   

 (e) Prairie will not be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period ending after the Effective Time as a result of any (i) change, made on or prior to the Closing Date, in the method of accounting for a tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" within the meaning of Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in the regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) occurring or existing before the Closing Date, (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, and (v) if an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code is not made with respect to the Merger, prepaid amounts which in the aggregate exceed $20,000 received on or prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 _Section 4.9 Employee Plans_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, all employee benefit, welfare, bonus, deferred compensation, pension, profit sharing, stock option, employee stock ownership, consulting, severance, or fringe benefit plans, formal or informal, written or oral and all trust agreements related thereto, relating to any present or former directors, 

   ##### 

  

    

officers or employees of Prairie or Prairie Subsidiaries ("Prairie Employee
Plans") have been maintained, operated, and administered in substantial
compliance with their terms and currently comply, and have at all relevant
times complied, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1934, as amended ("ERISA"),
the Code, and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth in the Prairie
Disclosure Letter, with respect to each Prairie Employee Plan which is a
pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), each pension plan as
amended (and any trust relating thereto) intended to be a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code either (a) has been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to be so qualified, (b) is the subject of a
pending application for such determination that was timely filed, or (c) may
still be submitted for such determination as an on-cycle filing under Revenue
Procedure 2005-66. None of Prairie, any of the Prairie Subsidiaries, or any
entity considered one employer with any of them under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code has ever established or maintained a pension plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or has ever been a participating employer in a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.
Each Prairie Employee Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
operated in good faith compliance with Code Section 409A since January 1,
2005. There is no basis for any person to assert that Prairie or any of the
Prairie subsidiaries has an obligation to institute any employee plan or any
such other arrangement, agreement or plan. Except as set forth in the Prairie
Disclosure Letter, neither Prairie nor a Prairie Subsidiary was or has used
any insurance policy to provide funding for a Prairie Employee Plan. Except
as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will
(A) constitute a stated triggering event under any Prairie Employee Plan that
will result in any payment (whether pay or otherwise) becoming due from
Prairie or any of the Prairie Subsidiaries to any present or former officer,
employee, director, stockholder, consultant or dependent of any of the
foregoing or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due, to any present or former officer, employee,
director, stockholder, consultant, or dependent of any of the foregoing.
Neither Prairie nor any of the Prairie Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health or life insurance benefits under any Prairie Employee Plan,
except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in
the Prairie Disclosure Letter, there are no restrictions on the rights of
Prairie or any of the Prairie Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any such
Prairie Employee Plan without incurring any liability thereunder. 

  

 _Section 4.10 Material Contracts_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the Prairie Financial Statements, neither Prairie nor any Prairie Subsidiary is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits under (a) any employment, severance, termination, consulting or retirement agreement (collectively, "Benefit Agreements") providing for aggregate payments to any person in any calendar year in excess of $50,000, (b) any material agreement, indenture or other instrument relating to the borrowing of money by Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary or the guarantee by Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary of any such obligation (other than trade payables and instruments relating to transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business) or (c) any other contract or agreement or amendment thereto that, if Prairie Common Stock was registered under the Exchange Act, would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K or (after August 23, 2004) a Form 8-K filed with the Commission as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Prairie Contracts"). Neither Prairie nor any Prairie 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiary is in default under any Prairie Contract, which default
is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred any event that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute such
a default. 

  

 _Section 4.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the Prairie Financial Statements, since December 31, 2005 there has not been any change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary which has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 4.12 Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of Prairie, threatened against or affecting Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to Prairie, would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator, outstanding against Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the business of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2001, Prairie and Prairie Bank have continuously maintained fidelity bonds insuring them against acts of dishonesty in such amounts as are customary, usual and prudent for organizations of their size and business. To the Knowledge of Prairie and Prairie Bank, there are no facts which would form the basis of a claim or claims under such bonds. Neither Prairie nor Prairie Bank has reason to believe that its respective fidelity coverage would not be renewed by the carrier on substantially the same terms as the existing coverage, except for possible premium increases unrelated to Prairies and the Prairie Subsidiaries past claim experience. 

  

 _Section 4.13 Compliance with Laws and Orders_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Prairie Financial Statements, the businesses of Prairie and each Prairie Subsidiary are not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, order, decree, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, in the case of a Prairie Subsidiary that is a bank, all statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the banking business and the exercise of trust powers), except for violations which individually or in the aggregate do not, and, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future will not, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary is pending or, to the Knowledge of Prairie, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, in each case other than those the outcome of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 4.14 Agreements with Bank Regulators, Etc._ Neither Prairie nor any Prairie Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter, board resolution or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Governmental Entity which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its management, except for those the existence of which has been disclosed in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, nor has Prairie been advised by any Governmental Entity that such Governmental Entity is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter or similar 

   ##### 

  

    

submission, except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter. Neither
Prairie nor any Prairie Subsidiary is required by Section 32 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act to give prior notice to a federal banking agency of the
proposed addition of an individual to its board of directors or the
employment of an individual as a senior or executive officer. Prairie knows of
no reason why the granting of the regulatory approvals referred to in Section
4.6 above would be denied or unduly delayed. 

  

 _Section 4.15 Fees_. Except for fees paid and payable to Hovde Financial, LLC, neither Prairie nor any Prairie Subsidiary has paid or will become obligated to pay any fee (including any break-up or termination fee) or commission to any broker, finder, intermediary or any other person in connection with, or as a result of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 4.16 Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the (i) holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Prairie Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Prairie capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) the holders of seventy-five (75%) of the outstanding shares of Prairie Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Prairie capital stock necessary to approve the termination of the Prairie Stockholder Agreement dated December 31, 1998 (the "Prairie Stockholder Agreement") by and among Prairie and its stockholders named therein (collectively, the "Required Prairie Vote"). 

  

 _Section 4.17 Environmental Matters_. (a) To the Knowledge of Prairie, neither Prairie nor any of the Prairie Subsidiaries is in violation of or has any liability, absolute or contingent, in connection with or under any Environmental Law, except any such violations or liabilities which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect; (b) to the Knowledge of Prairie, none of the Loan Portfolio Properties, Trust Properties and Other Properties of Prairie or any of the Prairie Subsidiaries is in violation of or has any liability, absolute or contingent, under any Environmental Law or as a result of the presence of any Hazardous Substances, except any such violations or liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) to the Knowledge of Prairie, there are no actions, suits, demands, notices, claims, investigations or proceedings pending or threatened relating to any Loan Portfolio Properties, Trust Properties and Other Properties including, without limitation, any notices, demand letters or requests for information from any federal or state environmental agency relating to any such liability under or violation of Environmental Law, which would impose a liability upon Prairie or any Prairie Subsidiary pursuant to any Environmental Law, except such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 4.18 Labor_. (a) Neither Prairie nor any of the Prairie Subsidiaries are engaged in, or have engaged in, any unfair labor practice; (b) there is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage actually pending, or, to the Knowledge of Prairie, threatened, against or directly affecting Prairie or the Prairie Subsidiaries; (c) no union is currently certified, there is no union representation question and no union or other organizational activity that would be subject to the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.

employees or independent contractor for any wages, salaries, commissions,
bonuses, benefits or other compensation for any services performed by them or
amounts required to be reimbursed to them. 

  

 _Section 4.19 Material Interests of Certain Persons_. Except as set forth in the Prairie Disclosure Letter, no officer or director of Prairie, or any "associate" of any such officer or director, has any material interest in any material contract or property (real or personal), tangible or intangible, used in or pertaining to the business of Prairie or any of the Prairie Subsidiaries. 

  

 _Section 4.20 Employment Agreements_. The Prairie Disclosure Letter lists each agreement, arrangement, commitment or contract (whether written or oral) for the employment, election, retention or engagement, or with respect to the severance, of any present or former officer, employee, agent, consultant or other person or entity to which Prairie or any of the Prairie Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by and which, by its terms, is not terminable by Prairie or such Prairie Subsidiary on thirty (30) days written notice or less without the payment of any amount by reason of such termination.

As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents, as amended, including any financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied with the relevant statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the regulatory authority with which they were filed, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 _Section 4.22 Loan Portfolio_. 

   

 (a) The Prairie Disclosure Letter lists as of August 31, 2006 each loan of Prairie Bank that has been classified by the FDIC, the State Agency or the FRB or management as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss" or that has been identified by accountants or auditors (internal or external) as having a significant risk of uncollectability. The most recent loan watch list of Prairie Bank and a list of all loans which Prairie Bank has determined to be thirty (30) days or more past due with respect to principal or interest payments or has been placed on nonaccrual status has been provided to Integra.

In addition, for a period of not less than four years after the Effective Time, Integra will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current directors and officers insurance policies maintained by Prairie as of the date hereof; provided, however, that if the annual cost of such "tail" insurance policies are not available at a cost not greater than 200% of the annual premium paid on the date of this Agreement by Prairie for such insurance (the "Insurance Cap"), Integra shall cause to be obtained as much comparable insurance for as long a period (not to exceed four years from the Effective Time) as is available for a cost not to exceed the Insurance Cap.

dollars ($1,000,000), and in the event of a Prairie Stockholder Termination,
Prairie shall pay to Integra, upon its written demand, an amount equal to the
sum of Integras Expenses, but not in excess of two hundred thousand Dollars
($200,000). 

   

 (c) In addition to any payments described in Section (b), if there is a Prairie Breach Termination or a Prairie Stockholder Termination, and within eighteen (18) months after such termination of this Agreement Prairie enters into an agreement, contract, letter of intent or understanding with any party other than Integra providing for the acquisition of control of Prairie or Prairie Bank by such other party, then: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) if the prior termination of this Agreement was a Prairie Breach Termination, Prairie shall pay to Integra, upon its written demand, the additional sum of three million eight hundred thousand dollars ($3,800,000); or 

   

 (ii) if the prior termination of this Agreement was a Prairie Stockholder Termination, Prairie shall pay to Integra, upon its written demand, the additional sum of four million eight hundred thousand dollars ($4,800,000); 

   

 _provided, however_ , that in each such case, the provisions of this
Section 8.10 shall in no way limit Integras rights against any such third
party. 

   

For purposes of this Section 8.10, the phrase "control of Prairie or
Prairie Bank" means the acquisition by any such third party of: (x) legal
or beneficial ownership (as defined by Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) of greater than twenty percent (20%) of the then issued
and outstanding voting stock of Prairie or Prairie Bank through any
transaction to which Prairie, Prairie Bank or any Affiliate of Prairie or
Prairie Bank is a party (other than by transfers among or between members of
a family, caused by redemptions or repurchases of Prairie capital stock by
Prairie or by issuance of shares of Prairie Common Stock or other securities
to holders of record of Prairie Common Stock as of the date hereof); or (y)
all or substantially all of the assets of Prairie or Prairie Bank (except
transfers to an Affiliate of Prairie or Prairie Bank). 

   

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Integra pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(i), (ii) or (iii) after a Competing Transaction has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the senior management of Prairie or the Prairie Board of Directors at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the stockholders of Prairie contemplated by this Agreement at the Prairie Stockholders Meeting, then Prairie shall pay to Integra, upon its written demand, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Integra, the sum of four million eight hundred thousand dollars ($4,800,000), plus an amount equal to the sum of Integras Expenses, but not in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). 

   

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated by Integra pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(iv) after a Competing Transaction has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the senior management of Prairie or the Prairie Board of Directors at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the stockholders of Prairie contemplated by this Agreement at the Prairie Stockholders Meeting, and subsequently, the stockholders of Prairie do not approve the Merger at the Prairie Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof as contemplated hereunder, then Prairie shall 

   ##### 

  

    

pay to Integra, upon its written demand, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an amount designated by Integra, the sum of four million
eight hundred thousand dollars ($4,800,000), plus an amount equal to the sum
of Integras Expenses, but not in excess of two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000). 

   

 (f) The sums payable by Prairie under this Sections 8.10(b), (c), (d) and (e) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Integra and shall constitute liquidated damages and Integras receipt thereof shall be Integras sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for all breaches of this Agreement by Prairie or failure by its stockholders to approve this Agreement. 

   

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated by Prairie because (i) Integra committed a breach of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement (but not a breach of its representations or warranties); or (ii) there is a breach of Integras representations or warranties as of the Agreement Date, unless, in either case, such breach is a result of the failure by Prairie to perform and comply in all material respects with any of its material obligations under or on the date required hereunder, or such breach or breaches, individually or in the aggregate, do not result in or would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Integra, then Prairie shall be entitled to recover any and all amounts and shall have any and all rights to which it may be entitled at law or in equity. 

   

 (h) If the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 8.11 Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof. 

  

 _Section 8.12 Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto. Upon any such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated to the extent possible. 

  

 _Section 8.13 Update and Supplement to Disclosure Letters_. Prairie and Integra shall be permitted to update and supplement their respective disclosure letters so as to disclose exceptions to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III hereof in the case of Integra and Sub and Article IV hereof in the case of Prairie which are a result of events which 

   ##### 

  

    

occur after the date hereof; provided, however, that, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, (a) no exceptions or other information set forth on
any such updated or supplemented disclosure letter shall be deemed to cure
any representation or warranty which was not true and correct as of the date
of this Agreement, (b) the exceptions and other information set forth on any
such updated or supplemented disclosure letter shall not be taken into
consideration in determining, for purposes of this Agreement, whether the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3 in the case of Integra and Sub, and
Section 7.2 hereof in the case of Prairie shall have been satisfied, and (c)
this Section 8.13 shall not relieve any party of its obligations under
any covenant set forth herein.

 Attention:  

  

      Re:   |   | Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October _
_, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Integra Bank Corporation
("Integra"), PFC Merger Corp. ("Sub") and Prairie Financial Corporation
("Prairie")  
---|---|--- 
   

  

Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Prairie, as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). 

  

 Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock of Prairie owned by me as of the effective time of the merger of Prairie with a subsidiary of Integra as contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Merger") will be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock of Integra ("Shares") and cash. This letter is delivered to Integra pursuant to Section 5.17 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

1\. I represent and warrant to Integra and agree that: 

   

 A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares I receive pursuant to the Merger in violation of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. 

   

 B. I understand that the issuance of the Shares to me pursuant to the Merger shall be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act. I also understand that because I may be deemed an "affiliate" of Prairie and because any distributions by me of the Shares shall not be registered under the Securities Act, such Shares must be held by me unless (i) the sale, transfer or other distribution has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) the sale, transfer or other distribution of such Shares is made in accordance with the provisions of Rule 145, or 

    ##### 

  

    

(iii) in the opinion of counsel acceptable to Integra some other exemption
from registration under the Securities Act is available with respect to any
such proposed distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of such
Shares. 

   

2\. I understand and agree that: 

   

 A. Stop transfer instructions shall be issued with respect to the Shares and there shall be placed on the certificates representing such Shares, or any certificate delivered in substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

    

"The shares represented by this Certificate have been issued to an affiliate
of a party to a transaction with Integra Bank Corporation pursuant to the
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933. A stop transfer
order with respect to this Certificate has been issued to the Transfer Agent.
The shares represented hereby will be transferred on the books of Integra
Bank Corporation only upon delivery to the Transfer Agent of evidence,
reasonably satisfactory to Integra Bank Corporation, that such
transfer complies in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder." 

  

 B. Unless the transfer by me of Shares is a sale made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, Integra reserves the right to place the following legend on the Certificates issued to my transferee: 

    

"The shares represented by this Certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and were acquired from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, applied. The shares have not been acquired by the
holder with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may
not be sold or otherwise transferred unless the shares have been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption
from registration is available." 

  

 I understand and agree that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute Certificates without any legend if I deliver to Integra a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance satisfactory to Integra, to the effect that no such legend is required for the purpose of the Securities Act. 

    ##### 

  

  

 I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and understand the requirements of each and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Shares by me. 

   

Very truly yours
