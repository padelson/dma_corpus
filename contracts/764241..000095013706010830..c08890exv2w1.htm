</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Prairie has received the opinion of Hovde Financial, Inc., its financial advisors,
that the consideration to be paid to stockholders of Prairie pursuant to this Agreement is fair
from a financial point of view;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties intend that immediately after the Merger becomes effective, Prairie Bank

no other corporate proceedings on the part of Prairie are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions so contemplated other than the Required Prairie Vote. This

stock of Prairie consists of 700,000 shares of Prairie Common Stock and 10,000 shares of preferred

paid and nonassessable and no shares of Prairie Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. As of

Effect on the business of Prairie and the Prairie Subsidiaries. Since January&nbsp;1, 2001, Prairie and

To the Knowledge of Prairie and Prairie Bank, there are no facts which would form the basis of a
claim or claims under such bonds. Neither Prairie nor Prairie Bank has reason to believe that its
respective fidelity coverage would not be renewed by the carrier on substantially the same terms as
the existing coverage, except for possible premium increases unrelated to Prairie&#146;s and the Prairie
Subsidiaries&#146; past claim experience.

shares of common stock of Integra (&#147;Shares&#148;) and cash. This letter is delivered to Integra
pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.17 of the Merger Agreement.

under the Securities Act, such Shares must be held by me unless (i)&nbsp;the sale, transfer or other
distribution has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;the sale, transfer or other

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&#147;The shares represented by this Certificate have been issued to an
affiliate of a party to a transaction with Integra Bank Corporation
