Section 2.5 _Effects on Capital Stock and Assumed RSUs_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties, each share of Company Stock (including
Company Restricted Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Stock owned by Parent, the Merger
Subsidiaries or the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration
(collectively, the "Merger Consideration"):

(i) Conversion of Company Stock.

(A) Subject to Section 2.5(d), each share of Company Stock with respect to
which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a "Mixed
Election") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.7
(each, a "Mixed Consideration Election Share") shall be converted into the
right to receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Per Share Mixed Consideration") of (x) the Per Share Mixed
Election Cash Amount plus (y) that number of shares of validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable Parent Stock equal to the Per Share Mixed Election
Stock Amount. The "Per Share Mixed Election Stock Amount" shall be equal to
(1) (a) fifty-five percent (55%) of the Purchase Price divided by the Closing
Average minus (b) the Calculated Option Amount, minus (c) the Assumed RSU
Amount, divided by (2) the total number of shares of Company Stock issued and
outstanding  



 

14  immediately prior to the Effective Time. The "Per Share Mixed Election Cash
Amount" shall be equal to (1) $7.30 minus (2) the Per Share Mixed Election
Stock Amount multiplied by the Closing Average.

(B) Each share of Company Stock with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to
Section 2.7 (each, a "Cash Election Share") shall be converted into the right
to receive (1) an amount in cash (not to exceed $7.30 per share), without
interest (the "Per Share Cash Election Cash Consideration"), equal to (x) the
Maximum Cash Amount minus (i) the product of the total number of Mixed
Consideration Election Shares and the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount
(such product being the "Mixed Election Cash Amount"), minus (ii) the Non-
Assumed Option Cash Amount and minus (iii) the Dissenters Cash Amount,
divided by (y) the sum of the total number of Cash Election Shares; and (2)
in the event the Per Share Cash Election Cash Consideration is less than $7.30
per share, that number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Parent Stock as is equal to $7.30 minus the Per Share Cash
Election Cash Consideration divided by the Closing Average (the "Per Share
Cash Election Stock Consideration").

(C) Each share of Company Stock with respect to which an election to receive
stock consideration (a "Stock Election") has been properly made and not
revoked pursuant to Section 2.7 (each, a "Stock Election Share") shall be
converted into the right to receive (1) that number of shares of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Stock (the "Per Share Stock
Election Stock Consideration") as is equal to (x) the Maximum Stock Amount
minus (i) the product of the total number of Mixed Consideration Election
Shares and the Per Share Mixed Election Stock Amount (such product being the
"Mixed Election Stock Amount"), minus (ii) the product of the total number of
Cash Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Stock Consideration (the
"Cash Election Stock Amount"), (iii) the Calculated Option Amount and minus
(iv) the Assumed RSU Amount, divided by (y) the total number of Stock Election
Shares (the "Stock Election Stock Amount"); _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall the number of shares of Parent Stock issued per share of Company
Stock under this Section 2.5(a)(i)(C) multiplied by the Closing Average exceed
$7.30; and (2) if the Per Share Stock Election Stock Consideration is
less than the number of shares of Parent Stock as is determined by dividing
$7.30 by the Closing Average (such difference being the "Stock Election
Shortfall Amount"), an amount in cash, without interest (the "Per Share
Stock Election Cash Consideration"), equal to the product of the Stock
Election Shortfall Amount and the Closing Average.

(D) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the sum of
(1) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.5(a)(i)(A), (B) and (C) plus (2) the Calculated Option Amount plus
(3) the Assumed RSU Amount (the sum of the amounts in clauses (1), (2) and
(3), the "Total Stock Amount") would be greater than the Maximum Stock Amount
(the  



 

15  "Excess Stock Amount"), then the shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to
the Stock Election shall be decreased to the minimum extent necessary on a
pro rata basis, such that the Total Stock Amount shall not exceed the Maximum
Stock Amount and each Stock Election Share shall receive additional cash in an
amount equal to the number of shares of Parent Stock by which such
Stock Election Shares Stock Election Stock Amount has been reduced
multiplied by the Closing Average.

(E) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sum of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(i)(A), (B) and (C) plus (2) the Option Stock Amount
plus (3) the Assumed RSU Amount would be greater than nineteen and one-half
percent (19.5%) of the shares of Parent Stock outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the "Stock Threshold"), the number
of shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be
decreased by the minimum number of shares necessary (the "Decreased Shares");
_provided_ , _however_ , that no decrease shall be made to the extent that
the Stock Threshold is exceeded as a result of a reverse stock split, stock
buy-back or other action by Parent, such that the Total Stock Amount shall not
exceed the Stock Threshold. In such event, the amount of cash paid pursuant
to Section 2.5(a)(i) shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of
the Decreased Shares and the Closing Average.

(F) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Total Cash Amount exceed the Maximum Cash Amount; in no event shall
the Total Stock Amount exceed the lower of the Maximum Stock Amount and the
Stock Threshold; and in no event shall the (i) Total Cash Amount plus (ii)
the Closing Average multiplied by the Total Stock Amount, exceed the Purchase
Price. To the extent any of these requirements are violated, the allocations
of Merger Consideration shall be adjusted pro rata, relative to cash or stock
as applicable, to the least extent necessary to comply with all requirements.

(ii) _Repurchase Rights_. If any shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
Company Restricted Stock Award or other agreement with the Company (such
shares of stock, the "Company Restricted Stock") that does not by its terms as
disclosed in Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or by the terms
of another agreement with the Company in effect as of the date hereof and
disclosed on Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) provide that
such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, then such awards
shall be treated as assumed and (x) the shares of Parent Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Restricted Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends until such time as such repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition expires or is otherwise extinguished,
at which time Parent shall cause such legends to be removed and (y) the  



 

16  cash portion of the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares
of Company Restricted Stock shall be withheld and retained by Parent and
shall be subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition. Parent shall hold the cash portion of the Merger Consideration so
withheld until such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
expires or is otherwise extinguished at which time such portion of the Merger
Consideration will be distributed to such former holder of shares of Company
Restricted Stock; _provided, however_ , such cash shall be permanently
retained by Parent upon forfeiture by the holder of such shares of Parent
Stock pursuant to the terms that governed such Company Restricted Stock prior
to the Effective Time. Upon consummation of the Merger, Parent will
automatically succeed to and become entitled to exercise the Companys rights
and remedies under any such Contract without modification. The Company shall
use reasonable efforts to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, the
Final Surviving Entity is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

(b) _Merger Subsidiary One Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of
Merger Subsidiary One outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) share of common stock of the
Interim Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Treasury Shares_. Each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the
Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Merger Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "Treasury Shares")
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Treatment of Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued by virtue of the First Step Merger. All fractional shares of
Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the First Step Merger shall be aggregated
and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be
entitled to receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying
such fractional share by the Closing Average. For purposes of calculating the
splits of stock and cash to be received by any Stockholder pursuant to Section
2.5, all calculations shall be completed prior to determining fractional
shares.

(e) _Changes in Capitalization_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the provisions of
this Agreement shall be adjusted to fully reflect the change in
capitalization.

(f) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, to the extent appraisal rights are available under
Section 262 of Delaware Law, shares of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder
who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented  



 

17  thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised such
stockholders statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares
of Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law ("Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.5. Any such stockholder shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Dissenting Shares held by
a stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such stockholders statutory right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 of Delaware Law shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, the
right to receive the same Merger Consideration received by each Cash Election
Share, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Stock in the
manner set forth in Section 2.8. The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal received by the Company, written
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of Delaware Law and received by the Company in respect of
Dissenting Shares and (y) the opportunity and right (at Parents election) to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Shares. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required
by an Order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of
Dissenting Shares.

Section 2.6 _Company Options and Company RSUs; Company ESPP_. The Board of
Directors of the Company has adopted or will adopt prior to the Effective
Time resolutions, and the Company has taken and/or shall take, as applicable,
all actions, necessary prior to the Effective Time to effect the following:

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders of Company Options, each
Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent (the
"Assumed Options") and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an
option denominated in shares of Parent Stock and which has other terms and
conditions substantially identical to those of the related Company Option
except that (i) each Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares
of Parent Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below),
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Stock at which such Assumed
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided, however,_
that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Option be performed in a
manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section
409A of the Code. The "Option Stock Amount" means the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 2.6(a). The "Option
Exchange Ratio" means (i)(A) 0.267008, multiplied by (B) the Elected Stock  



 

18  Percentage; plus (ii) (A) the quotient obtained by dividing $7.30 by the
closing sale price for Parent Stock on the NASDAQ for the last trading
day immediately prior to the Closing Date, multiplied by (B) the Elected Cash
Percentage. The Company agrees that the assumption and adjustment of Company
Options in accordance with this Section 2.6(a) shall preserve the compensation
element of each Company Option as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless determined otherwise by Parent, each Company Option that is
held by a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Non-Assumed Options") shall not be assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section
2.6 and shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be canceled and
extinguished and the vested portion thereof shall automatically be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock
that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Non-Assumed Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time (for these purposes, after giving
effect to any applicable vesting acceleration provisions) and (ii) $7.30, less
any per share exercise price of such Non-Assumed Options. All Company Options
held by non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
Non-Assumed Options for purposes of this Agreement and converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to the immediately preceding sentences. The
Company shall at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time provide a
notice to all holders of Assumed Options and Non-Assumed Options of the effect
of the transaction on their options. The Company shall also provide notice
that all holders of outstanding Company Options which as of the Effective Time
will be Non-Assumed Options have the opportunity to exercise their vested
options on or before the termination date of the option and during a specified
period prior to the Effective Time, and that upon a failure to so exercise a
Non-Assumed Option, each Non-Assumed Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be extinguished and converted into a right to receive
cash in accordance with this section. Parent shall take such actions as are
necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Company Options pursuant to
this Section 2.6, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent
Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.6. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to each holder of any Company Option an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Company Option.
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Assumed Options promptly (but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business
Days) following the Effective Time and Parent shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such Assumed Options remain outstanding. The Company
and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the
preparation of such registration statement prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time by virtue of the
First Step Merger and without any action on behalf of the Parties, each
Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested ("Assumed RSUs"), shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into a restricted stock unit with terms and conditions substantially
identical to those of the related Company RSU, except that the Assumed RSUs
will represent the right to receive upon vesting (or such later payment event
as provided for with respect to each such Assumed RSU), 0.267008 of a share of
Parent Stock with respect to each share of Company Stock that was subject to
the Assumed RSU. Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the
assumption and conversion of the Company RSUs pursuant to this Section 2.6,  



 

19  including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.6. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to each holder of any Company RSU an appropriate notice setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to such Company RSU. Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares
of Parent Stock issuable upon vesting of the Assumed RSUs promptly (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days) following the Effective Time and
Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed RSUs
remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

(c) _ESPP_. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i)
provide that no Offering Periods shall commence under the Company ESPP on or
following the date hereof and (ii) terminate the Company ESPP on or before the
last day of the payroll period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time
(but in all events at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time).

(d) Equity Plan Awards. As provided in Section 2.5 and Section 2.6(a)
and (b), the Parties intend that each of the outstanding awards under the
Company Equity Plans, other than the Non-Assumed Options, shall be treated as
assumed by Parent under the terms of each of the Company Equity Plans.

Section 2.7 _Election Procedures_

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Election Form") shall be mailed together with
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or at such other time as the Company and
Parent may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Company
Stock as of the close of business on the record date for notice of the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the "Election Form Record Date").

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial
owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions),
other than any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) that such holder
elects to make a Mixed Election, (ii) that such holder elects to make a Stock
Election, or (iii) that such holder elects to make a Cash Election. Any
Company Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other
time and date as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline")
(other than any Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall be deemed to have
made a Cash Election.

(c) Parent shall make available one (1) or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Company Stock between the Election Form Record Date
and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline,
and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.



 

20 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if
required by Parent or the Final Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such customary and reasonable amount as the Final Surviving
Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate) or Uncertificated Shares representing all
shares of Company Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.
In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the
certificates for the shares of Company Stock represented by such Election Form
shall be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the
Election Form, and such holder shall thereafter be deemed to have made a Cash
Election except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to all of such shares of Company Stock. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

Section 2.8 _Exchange Procedures_

(a) _Exchange Agent; Letters of Transmittal_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent"), who shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company
Stock for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this ARTICLE 2, the following:

(i) a number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient to issue the Total Stock
Amount issuable pursuant to ARTICLE 2, minus (A) the Assumed RSU Amount and
minus (B) the Calculated Option Amount;

(ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Total Cash Amount payable
pursuant to ARTICLE 2, minus the Non-Assumed Option Cash Amount; and

(iii) cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends
or other distributions which holders of shares of Company Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5.

(b) All shares of Parent Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant hereto shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".
Pursuant to irrevocable  



 

21  instructions, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver the Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund to the former Company Stockholders who
are entitled thereto pursuant to Section 2.5.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the
Effective Time (other than any holder that has previously and properly
surrendered all of its Certificates or Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with Section 2.7), a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall be in a customary form reasonably acceptable to the
Company and shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of (i) Certificates or
(ii) Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent shall
reasonably specify) for use in such exchange.

(d) _Surrender and Payment_. Each Company Stockholder that holds Company Stock
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares) converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon receipt of a
letter of transmittal properly completed in all material respects and the (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or (ii) receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares delivered pursuant to
either Section 2.7 or this Section 2.8, the Merger Consideration without
interest in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such
Total Stock Amount, at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of
Company Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or
such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(f) _Stock Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Final Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this ARTICLE 2.

(g) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
(and any interest or other income earned thereon) made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.8(a) that remains unclaimed by Company
Stockholders twelve (12) months after the  



 

22  Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Section 2.8 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any Company
Stockholder for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may determine is customary and reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Final Surviving Entity with
respect to such Certificate, and upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of a
duly completed letter of transmittal in accordance with this Section 2.8,
following the Effective Time the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, without interest.

(i) _Dividends on Parent Stock_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Stock constituting part of the Merger
Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in
Section 2.5(d), shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not
surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, as provided in this Section 2.8. Following such surrender or
transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name
such shares of Parent Stock have been registered, (i) promptly following such
surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(d) and the
amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with
respect to such shares of Parent Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Stock.

(j) _Withholding_. Parent, the Final Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to holders of Company Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Final
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Tax law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

of the consummation of the Merger, the Company Stockholder Approval (as
defined below). The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions

materially delay or impede performance by the Company of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.4 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), (a) assuming the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof, or any equivalent

amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Liens on any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, any Material Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound.

compliance in all material respects with the requirements of COBRA.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) constitute an event under a Company Benefit Plan that
will or may result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of,
or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any Person or

pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code. No condition or
circumstance since the date of the documents provided in accordance with

associated with such termination) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
at any time after the Effective Time.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement between or applying to one or more employees
and a trade union, works council, employee congress or other form of employee
association or employee representative body, and no such collective
bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no pending labor dispute, strike or work stoppage,
slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations or grievances, or other labor disputes
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no such disputes have
occurred or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, been
threatened, during the past three years. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding labor or employment-related Order,

Company, threatened, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of
their current or former employees, which controversies have or
could reasonably be expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation before any Governmental Authority or any court of
competent jurisdiction. No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any term of any employment contract, non-disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use of trade
secrets or proprietary information of others. Within the past three years, to
the extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has implemented any
plant closing or layoff of employees that implicated the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any similar foreign, state
or local law, regulation or ordinance (collectively, the "WARN Act"), such
plant closing or layoff of employees complied with the WARN Act in all
material respects.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to

Tax law).

(ii) employment authorization or work visa status, (iii) date of hire and
service dates and (iv) current wages, salaries or hourly rate of pay,
benefits, vacation entitlement, commissions and bonus (whether monetary or
otherwise). Each Person who is an independent contractor is properly
classified as an independent contractor for purposes of all employment-
related Applicable Law and all Applicable Law concerning the status of
independent contractors. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability, whether absolute or contingent, including any
obligations under any Company Benefit Plan, with respect to any
misclassification of a Person performing services for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.

(k) Except as listed in Section 4.19(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains, or sponsors any

40  been "materially modified" at any time after October 3, 2004, and (iv) the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any adverse tax
consequences to the participants in such plan under Section 409A of the Code
(including the inclusion in income of deferred amounts, or any additional tax
pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code).

(l) All Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock have been
appropriately authorized by the Companys Board of Directors or a
duly authorized committee thereof, including approval of the exercise or
purchase price or the methodology for determining the exercise or purchase
price, if applicable, and the substantive terms of the Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock. All Company Options, which might
otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, have an exercise price that
is not less than the fair market value of the Company Stock on the date the
option was granted as determined under Section 409A of the Code on the date
the option was granted. No Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted
Stock has been retroactively granted, or the exercise or purchase price of any
Company Options determined retroactively. 

Section 4.20 _Intellectual Property Matters_

the following forms of intellectual property and all intellectual property
rights arising under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction
with respect thereto: (i) trade names, trademarks, service names and service
marks (registered and unregistered), domain names, trade dress and
applications to register any of the foregoing and all goodwill associated
with any of the foregoing (collectively, "Marks"), (ii) patents and patent
applications (including all reissues, divisions, substitutions, continuations,
continuations-in-part, extensions, reexaminations thereof and foreign

excluding any Copyrights or Patents that cover or protect any of the
foregoing (collectively, "Trade Secrets").

(b) Section 4.20(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list of all registered Marks and applications for
registration of Marks owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Company Registered Marks"); Section 4.20(b)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of all
Patents owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company Patents"); and Section 4.20(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of all registered Copyrights
and all pending applications for registration of Copyrights owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Registered
Copyrights" and, together with the Company Registered Marks and the Company
Patents, the "Company Registered IP"). The Company Registered IP is subsisting
and is not, to the knowledge of the Company, subject to any interference,
reissue, reexamination, opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no such action is or has been threatened in
writing with respect to any of the Company Registered IP. The Company  



 

41  Registered IP is, to the knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable,
and no notice or claim challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of,
or alleging the misuse of, any of the Company Registered IP has been received
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company or a Subsidiary has (i)
filed, prosecuted, perfected and maintained each item of Company Registered IP
in compliance with all Applicable Laws, (ii) not taken any action or failed
to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the
abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of any of the Company Registered IP and (iii) timely paid
all filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees, and
annuities with respect to any of the Company Registered IP, other than for
those items of Company Registered IP that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has, in the exercise of its reasonable business discretion,
determined to have no substantial value to the Company or the respective
Subsidiary.

(c) Subject to (i) reasonable and customary disclosure in the ordinary course
of business to Third Parties pursuant to non-disclosure agreements and (ii)
non-exclusive licenses granted to Third Parties in the ordinary course of
business, the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to
maintain and protect their rights in the Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, other than Intellectual Property that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, in the exercise of its reasonable
business discretion, determined to have no substantive value to the Company or
the respective Subsidiary ("Company Intellectual Property"), and to maintain
the confidentiality of all of the Trade Secrets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, no portion of the source code
for any Company Intellectual Property that is software used in or with any
existing or proposed product of the Company has been provided, disclosed or
licensed to any escrow agent or other Third Party. The policy of the Company
is to have each employee, consultant, contractor and other Person who has
participated in the creation of any material Company Intellectual Property
(each, a "Contributor") enter, and each Contributor that is a third party or
current employee has entered, into a written agreement that assigns or
obligates the Contributor to assign to the Company all such Contributors
right, title and interest in such Contributors contribution to such material
Company Intellectual Property, and to the extent that a right is
not assignable, Contributor has waived any such right, including moral
rights. The Company has made available to Parent the Companys standard form
of proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements. Except
as set forth in Section 4.20(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any submission to, or entered
into any Contract with, any standards bodies or other organizations that would
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant licenses or that
would otherwise impair the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries control of
any of the Company Intellectual Property. Section 4.20(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is obligated to license (or to grant any
rights or immunities under) any of the Company Intellectual Property in
connection with any technical standard or standards body. A copy of each such
Contract has previously been provided to Parent.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries own all
Company Intellectual Property free and clear of any Liens or joint ownership
interests. Except as set forth in Section 4.20(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any Contract with any third party that would create a Company joint ownership
interest. Section 4.20(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule  



 

42  identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has created a Company joint ownership interest. A copy of each
such Contract has previously been provided to Parent. None of the Company
Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding Order restricting the use
thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2001, no funding,
facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority were used, directly or
indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Company
Intellectual Property.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) assigned rights in
or to any Company Intellectual Property to a Third Party, (ii) except for
Company Intellectual Property jointly developed with a Third Party in which
the Company retained non-exclusive, royalty-free license rights, granted to
any third party any exclusive rights under or to any Company Intellectual
Property or (iii) granted any rights under or to any Company
Intellectual Property other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the
ordinary course of business in connection with (x) the sale or distribution of
the products of the Company or a Subsidiary, (y) an obligation to license
necessary claims to Third Parties on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
in connection with technical contributions to standards bodies or (z)
reciprocal licenses of necessary claims with Third Parties on royalty-free or
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. 

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the conduct of the business of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor any of the products or services
distributed, licensed, sold or offered by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
infringes upon, misappropriates or constitutes the dilution of any
Intellectual Property of any Third Party or constitutes unfair competition or
trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, and since January 1,
2007, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any such infringement,
misappropriation or dilution, or unfair competition or trade practices.

(g) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby will (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) result in, or give any other Person the
right or option to cause or declare, (i) a loss or ownership of, or Lien on,
any Company Intellectual Property, (ii) the release, disclosure or delivery
of any Company Intellectual Property to any Person, including to or from any
escrow agent, or (iii) any grant, assignment, or transfer to any other Person
of any license or other right or interest under, to or in any of the Company
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no Third Party has
made any unauthorized disclosure of any Trade Secrets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the products sold, marketed, licensed or
otherwise distributed by the Company and its Subsidiaries do not contain
"back door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," "worm,"
"spyware" or "adware" (as such terms are commonly understood in the software
industry) or similar function or code designed or intended to have any of the
following functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming or otherwise
purposefully impeding in any manner the operation of, or providing
unauthorized access to, a computer system, device or network or (ii)
compromising the privacy or security of a user or damaging or destroying any
data or file without the users consent.



 

43 (i) No software used in a product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any agreement obligating the Company to make source code owned by
the Company or incorporated in the Company products available to third parties
or to publish or place in escrow any source code owned by the Company or
incorporated in the Company products. No event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the
disclosure or delivery by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any Person of any such Company-owned source code, and no portions of such
Company-owned source code have been disclosed, delivered or licensed to any
Person.

Merger for such shares of Company Stock is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

Section 4.26 _Antitakeover Statutes_. The Company has taken all commercially
necessary action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other anti-takeover law or similar statute or regulation
(other than the interested stockholder provisions codified in Section 203 of
the Delaware Law) or any anti-takeover provision in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company is applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger, the Support Agreements or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, accordingly, no such anti-takeover law or similar statute or
regulation and no such provision applies or purports to apply to any such
transactions. Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in
Section 5.15 hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken and will
take all actions necessary to ensure that the restrictions applicable to
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the Delaware Law are, and
will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Support Agreements and to the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.27 _No Additional Representations_. Parent acknowledges and agrees
that except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries  



 

46  nor any of their respective Representatives has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, to Parent or any of its Representatives
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
Representatives makes any representation or warranty to Parent with respect
to any financial projection or forecast relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE 5 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule delivered herewith and

Parent with the SEC and publicly available prior to the date hereof, Parent
and the Merger Subsidiaries jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualifications_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary One is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Subsidiary Two is a

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary One and Merger Subsidiary Two has the requisite corporate or
similar power and corporate or similar authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent is duly qualified to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or in good standing that would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parents Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that were filed as
Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.3 to Parents Registration Statement on Form S-1,
respectively, are complete and correct copies thereof as in effect on the
date hereof, and all amendments thereto, as currently in effect. Parent is not
in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, except for any
such violations that, in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

and Merger Subsidiary Two has all necessary corporate or similar power and
corporate or similar authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions

this Agreement by each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger Subsidiary
Two and the consummation by each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger
Subsidiary Two of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate or similar action on the part
of each of them, and no other corporate or similar proceedings on the part of
any of them are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than the filing of the Certificates
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with Delaware Law. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger
Subsidiary Two and, assuming this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger
Subsidiary Two, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.3 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall

the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger Subsidiary Two of this
Agreement do not, and the  



 

48  consummation by each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary One and Merger Subsidiary
Two of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (with or without notice

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or similar organizational documents of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, as in effect on the date hereof, (b)
assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations described in Section
5.3 have been obtained prior to the Effective Time and all filings and

with or violate any Applicable Law applicable to Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent or by which any of their properties or assets are bound or (c) require
any consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any
benefit under, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of

creation of any Liens on any property or asset of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent pursuant to, any Contract to which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for matters that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary One or Merger Subsidiary Two to consummate, or
prevent or materially delay, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) Parent has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements or other
documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2008 (collectively, the "Parent SEC
Documents"). Each Parent SEC Document (a) as of its date, complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, as in effect on the date so filed
and (b) did not, at the time it was filed (or, if subsequently amended or
supplemented, at the time of such amendment or supplement), contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Subsidiary of Parent is separately subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received by Parent
from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents. Parent
has made available to the Company correct and complete copies of any

recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of its Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, or to the knowledge of Parent,
alleged fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over

design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting, and to
the knowledge of Parent, there is not any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.
The certifications and statements required by (A) Rule 13a-14 under the
Exchange Act and (B) 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
relating to the Parent SEC Documents were, at the time of their respective
filing or submission, accurate and complete and complied in all material
respects as to form and content with Applicable Law.

(c) Since January 1, 2008, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the knowledge of Parent, any Representatives of Parent has received
or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. To
the knowledge of Parent, no attorney representing Parent or any of its

50  or any of its Representatives to the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent. To the knowledge
of Parent, no employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or
is providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the

on a consistent basis during the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and each of the
Parent Financial Statements presents fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of operations and cash flow of Parent for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, to normal period end adjustments).

Section 5.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of a nature, whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent, except for liabilities
or obligations (a) that are incurred after June 30, 2009 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (b) that were incurred under
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
(c) that were disclosed or reserved against in the most recent Parent
Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or (d) that represent no
more than $5,000,000 in the aggregate (not including for this calculation any

thereto, at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. The Registration Statement (except for such portions thereof

or supplement thereto is first mailed to the Company Stockholders or at the
time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they are made not misleading.

Section 5.10 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, arbitration, claim,
investigation or proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any respective

"Financing").

Section 5.14 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or the holders of any other securities of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (equity or otherwise), is required by
any applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or

securities of Parent or any of its Affiliates are traded, in order for Parent
or any of its Affiliates to consummate the Merger or effect the Financing.

(q) terminate the employment of any of the individuals, or amend or rescind or
otherwise materially alter, the employment arrangements of the individuals,
set forth on Schedule A attached hereto;

(r) take any action which would reasonably be expected to cause any conditions
of the Merger to not be satisfied;

(s) make any representations or issue any communications to current or former
employees, independent contractors or directors that are inconsistent in any
material respect with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
including any representations regarding offers of employment from Parent, any
Subsidiary of Parent, or the Final Surviving Entity; or

(t) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 6.2 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, Merger Subsidiary One or Merger Subsidiary Two,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete and independent control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.3 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement_

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with
the SEC, the Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall include
(i) a prospectus for the issuance of shares of Parent Stock pursuant to the
Merger, and (ii) a proxy statement of the Company for use in connection with
the solicitation of proxies for the Merger Proposal to be considered at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (as may be amended or supplemented from time to
time, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing with the SEC and to keep the Registration
Statement effective through the Closing in order to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause its respective Representatives to, fully cooperate with the other party
hereto and its respective Representatives in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish
 



 

56  the other party hereto with all information concerning it and its Affiliates
as the other party hereto may deem reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto, and each
of Parent and the Company shall provide the other party hereto with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement has become
effective (but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company
Stockholders. Subject to and without limiting the rights of the Board of
Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 6.5(a), the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject
to Section 6.5(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall publicly
reaffirm such recommendation at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting within forty-eight (48) hours following any written request to do so
by Parent.

(c) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
comply in all material respects as to form and substance with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or
declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the
time the Registration Statement is declared effective, on the date the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to stockholders, or at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule
425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a
"Regulation M-A Filing") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing
is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
notify each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event
or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement
to, the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation
M-A Filing so that any such document would not include any misstatement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, and as promptly as practicable thereafter, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and the Company shall
each notify the other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of
any written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or
oral request by the SEC or its staff for  



 

57  amendments or supplements to, the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply
the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the foregoing
filings. Prior to filing the Registration Statement or mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to stockholders (or filing or mailing any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto), each of Parent and the Company, as the case
may be, (i) shall provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such
document or response all comments reasonably and timely proposed by such other
Party and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or response to the SEC
prior to receiving such other Partys approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Parent and the Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Stock to
be issued pursuant to the Merger will be registered (to the extent required),
qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under any applicable
federal or state securities or blue sky laws.

Section 6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_

(a) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1,
the Company shall (i) establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders and take a vote
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholders approval in favor of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein in accordance with
Delaware Law (the "Merger Proposal") at a meeting of the Company
Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective (but taking into account any advance notice or other requirements
under Applicable Law), (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. Provided this Agreement has not
otherwise been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Companys obligations
pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i) and (ii) shall not be affected by the public
announcement or public disclosure of, or the communication to the Company of,
any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or indication of interest with respect
thereto, or by an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting solely (i) for
up to ten (10) Business Days, if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) for up to ten
(10) Business Days, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in
order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by
issuing a press release, filing materials with the  



 

58  SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Adverse Recommendation
Change), (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting by any other Applicable Law, Order or a request
from the SEC or its staff or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_

(a) Subject to Section 6.5(b), the Company shall not, and the Company shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate
or knowingly encourage any inquiries or indication of interests regarding, or
the making or submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into
or participate in any discussions or negotiations (oral or written) regarding
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest with respect
thereto, or furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, except as required by Applicable Law,
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise assist, cooperate in any
way with, or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
any effort by, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest with respect
thereto, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation (or publicly recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry or indication of interest with respect thereto, or
take any public action or make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an
"Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement
in principle, letter of intent, term sheet or other similar instrument
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Third
Party (other than Parent and its Representatives) that may be ongoing as of
the date hereof with respect to any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry or indication of interest with respect thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal received
by the Company after the date hereof that was not solicited in
material violation of Section 6.5(a), or, prior to the date of this Agreement
in material violation of that certain Letter Agreement dated August 17, 2009,
between Parent and the Company (the "Letter Agreement") and with respect
to which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (i)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) that taking the actions set forth in
clauses (A), (B) or (C) below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal is
necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.5(c) and Section 6.5(d), (A) provide access to its
properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records and furnish information,
data and/or draft agreements with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition  



 

59  Proposal or (C) in the event that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or enter into an agreement
regarding such Superior Proposal; _provided, however,_ that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (x) the Company has given Parent five (5) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal as initially proposed by such Person (it
being understood and agreed that any material change to the consideration
offered and/or other change to the material terms of any Superior Proposal as
initially proposed by such Person shall require an additional notice to
Parent and a new three (3) Business Day notice period), (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith and, if requested
by Parent in writing, the Company shall have met with Parent to discuss
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any
changes or revisions to this Agreement committed to by Parent and shall not
have determined that the Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect or shall have
determined to make such Adverse Recommendation Change even if such changes
were to be given effect and (z) the Company has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Section 6.5.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company or any of
its Representatives of (i) any indication that a Third Party is considering
making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information by any Third
Party that may be considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
or indication of interest with respect thereto, or (iii) any Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, along with the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal, and, to the extent available, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy or a written summary of the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status (including any change to the material terms) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, potential Acquisition Proposal or information
request. Following a determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a written notice advising it that the Board of
Directors of the Company has made such determination together with a copy of
any draft or definitive agreements related to such Superior Proposal and a
summary of the material terms of such Superior Proposal. The Company agrees
that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement or other agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

(d) Prior to furnishing any information to or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any Person making an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(c), the Company shall receive from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement, the terms of which shall be no less
favorable to the Company than, in the aggregate, those contained in the
letter agreement dated as of May 11, 2009 between the Company and Parent, as
amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (a copy of which shall be provided
for informational purposes only to Parent). The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries not previously provided to Parent or the Parent
Representatives that is provided to any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal. The  



 

60  Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision or any existing standstill to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, unless the Board of Directors of the
Company determines that such action is necessary in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (in which case, such termination,
waiver, amendment or modification shall, to the extent approved by Parent,
also apply to the Confidentiality Agreement and the Letter Agreement, to the
extent applicable).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 6.5 shall prohibit or restrict the Company or the Board of Directors
of the Company from (a) taking and/or disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (b) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, such disclosure would be necessary under Applicable Law (including
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act); _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall this Section 6.5(e) affect the obligations of
the Company otherwise specified in Section 6.5.

Section 6.6 _Access to Information_

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and each of its and their Representatives to: (i) provide to Parent, the
Merger Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to the officers, employees, agents, Contracts,
properties, assets, offices and other facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (ii) furnish, or cause
to be furnished, (A) such reasonably available information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other
aspects of or information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives may
reasonably request so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of the Company, cause a violation of any agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, cause a risk of loss or
privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or could cause a violation of Applicable Law and (B) to
Parent, unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each fiscal month then ended and related consolidated
statements of earnings and cash flows (which the Company shall furnish to
Parent at substantially the same time such information is furnished on a
monthly basis to the management of the Company in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), weekly booking, backlog and shipment
reports, weekly flash reports, weekly cash forecasts, periodic revenue and
gross margin reports, periodic sales forecasts, quarterly data and financial
summary reports and quarterly financial models; _provided, however,_ that the
foregoing shall not require the Company to disclose any information to the
extent such disclosure would contravene Applicable Law. No investigation made
or information provided, made available or delivered to Parent, the Merger
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the Parties
thereunder.



 

61 (b) Any information provided, made available or delivered by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to Parent, the
Merger Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to
Section 6.6(a) shall be held in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (a)
the Effective Time or (b) the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement
according to its terms, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Action and Assurances_

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be
fulfilled the Closing conditions under this Agreement, including the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals
required under Applicable Law from any Governmental Authority and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority. Each party hereto, at the
reasonable request of another party hereto, will execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (i) hold
separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective
businesses or assets, (ii) enter into any consent decree or other agreement
that would restrict either Parent or the Company in the conduct of its
business as heretofore conducted, (iii) litigate or otherwise contest any
administrative or judicial action that may be brought in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) enter into any licensing
arrangement with respect to any of its assets or properties.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
waiver, in form provided by Parent to the Company prior to the date hereof
or otherwise in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of each former
Company director and officer regarding any obligation of the Company, its
successors and assigns to maintain any standby letter of credit or other Third
Party guarantee in connection with indemnification obligations set forth in
any applicable indemnification agreement or arrangement between the Company
and such director and/or officer.

(c) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Interim
Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving Entity shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger
Subsidiary One or Merger Subsidiary Two any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
Merger Subsidiary One or Merger Subsidiary Two, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Interim Surviving
Corporation or Final Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Interim Surviving Corporation or Final
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.



 

62 Section 6.8 _Notices of Certain Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall give prompt written
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company,
of (a) any material notice or other material communication received by such
Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(b) any material claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations
commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, overtly threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (c) any fact, event or circumstance known to such
Party that would cause or constitute, or would reasonably be expected to
cause or constitute, a breach in any material respect of any such Partys
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or would
prevent, materially delay or impede, or would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or impede, the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the Party receiving such notice or
prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant or failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; provided, further, however, that a failure to
comply with this Section 6.8 prior to the Closing Date in and of itself will
not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in ARTICLE 7 to
be satisfied unless (i) such failure materially prejudices another Partys
ability to exercise its rights or remedies hereunder prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) the underlying event would independently result in the failure of
a condition set forth in ARTICLE 7 to be satisfied.

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent.
Thereafter, except with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or other
action taken by the Company pursuant to Section 6.5, none of the Parties
shall (and each of the Parties shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to) issue any press release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the
Company, in the event the disclosing party is Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or (b) Parent, in the
event the disclosing party is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives, in each case, with such consent not to be
unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld; _provided, however,_ that if a
Party determines, after consultation with counsel, that a press release or
public announcement is required by, or reasonably necessary in order to comply
with, Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of NASDAQ or any other
securities exchange on which the Company Stock or the Parent Stock is listed,
or is otherwise permitted pursuant to the exercise of the Companys rights
under Section 6.5(b), such Party may make such press release or public
announcement, in which case the disclosing Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other Parties reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.



 

63 Section 6.10 _Obligations with Respect to Continuing Employees and Benefit
Matters_

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, subject
to compliance with Applicable Law and Parents applicable benefit plans, the
employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the Final Surviving
Entity (the "Continuing Employees") shall, with respect to benefits of the
Company that are not continued after the Effective Time, receive employee
benefits substantially similar to those received by similarly situated
employees of Parent (taking into account the employees performance and
geographic location).

(b) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law and Parents applicable benefit
plans, Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to recognize the service
of each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent
with respect to any plans or programs in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time (i) for purposes of
eligibility for vacation, (ii) for purposes of eligibility and participation
under any health or welfare plan (other than any post-employment health or
post-employment welfare plan), (iii) for purposes of eligibility for any
matching contributions under a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code and (iv) for the purpose of
determining the amount of any severance payable under any severance plan of
general application, except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would
result in duplicative benefits. Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Entity
to recognize any vacation time of Continuing Employees that has accrued and
has not been used as of the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that Parent
shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to promptly pay after the Closing all
Continuing Employees for any accrued and unused vacation time that is in
excess of the maximum number of accrued and unused vacation days allowed with
respect to Parent employees generally minus five (5) days, and thereafter
Continuing Employees will be subject to the maximum vacation accruals
applicable to Parent employees of similar seniority.

(c) Any Continuing Employee who (i) is not a party to an employment,
consulting, change in control or severance agreement or contract
providing severance payments or (ii) has not entered into an employment or
consulting agreement with Parent or any of its current Subsidiaries and whose
employment is terminated without "cause" within twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time and who signs a release in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent (it being understood that the form of release customarily
used by the Company shall be reasonably acceptable), shall receive severance
benefits equal to two weeks of such Continuing Employees annual base salary,
plus one week of such Continuing Employees annual base salary for each year
of service with the Company and/or Parent. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Final Surviving Entity to, assume the obligations, including without
limitation, any severance obligations, under any employment, consulting,
change in control or severance agreement or contract providing severance
payments between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and
any Continuing Employee.

(d) With respect to any group health plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
and subject to compliance with Applicable Law and any such group health plan,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to, take commercially
reasonable steps to waive limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such  



 

64  Continuing Employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were
satisfied or did not apply to such Continuing Employees under the applicable
group health plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

(e) With regard to payments to be made under the Companys Annual Cash
Incentive Plan and any sales and business development incentive plans
(collectively, the "ACIP") for the second half plan period of 2009 (including,
without limitation, any payments due from the first half plan period of
2009), if the Effective Time occurs after the date on which payments to
participants under the ACIP are scheduled to be made, the Company shall make
all such payments to the participants on the date or dates determined by the
Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of the ACIP (the "ACIP
Payment Date"). If the Effective Time occurs prior to the date such payments
have been made, Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to,
pay each participant under the ACIP the payments that would be due under the
applicable terms of such plan, and, if any participant in the ACIP is
terminated without "cause" by Parent or the Final Surviving Entity, or any of
their Affiliates, prior to the date such payments are made, then,
notwithstanding any provision of the ACIP requiring that the participant
remain employed as of an applicable payment date in order to receive payment,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to, pay each
such participant terminated without "cause," the payment that would otherwise
have been paid to such person if such person had remained an employee as of
the applicable ACIP Payment Date.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing in this Section 6.10, expressed or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the
compensation and benefit plans, programs or arrangements maintained for or
provided to Continuing Employees or any other employees of Parent prior to, on
or following the Effective Time, or of either Final Surviving Entity
following the Effective Time, or impose an obligation on any of the Company,
Parent or, on or after the Effective Time, either Final Surviving Entity, to
establish, continue, amend, terminate or otherwise take any action with
respect to any compensation or benefits plan, program or arrangement or (ii)
confer upon or give to any Person (including any current or former employees,
directors, or independent contractors of any of the Company, Parent, or, on
or after the Effective Time, either Final Surviving Entity), other than the
Parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with
respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.10). For the avoidance
of doubt, no provision of this Agreement shall create any Third Party
beneficiary rights in any employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or
any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions or existence of employment and benefits
that may be provided to any employee by the Company, Parent or either Final
Surviving Entity or under any benefit plan which the Company, Parent or either
Final Surviving Entity may maintain. 

(g) Unless otherwise directed by Parent at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall not take any action to terminate
the Company Benefit Plans that are self-funded "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of ERISA or that are intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (collectively, "Surviving Benefit Plans"). If Parent shall direct
the Company to terminate the Surviving Benefit Plans, the Company shall take
any and all actions required to terminate the Surviving Benefit Plans as of a
date no later than one (1) day prior to the Closing Date. Such actions shall
include providing to Parent  



 

65  executed resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors terminating the
Surviving Benefit Plans. The form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to the review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The Company shall also take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Surviving Benefit Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. If the Company is required to terminate its 401(k) plan
pursuant to this Section 6.10(g), Parent shall (or cause the Final Surviving
Entity to) take such actions as are necessary to cause a retirement plan
maintained by it or one of its ERISA Affiliates that is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code to accept qualifying direct and indirect rollover
distributions of the Continuing Employees balances under the Companys 401(k)
plan. In the event that termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time.

Section 6.11  _Indemnification and Insurance_

(a) The Company shall purchase prior to the Closing an insurance and
indemnification policy in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time ("DandO Insurance") covering each such person currently covered
by the officers and directors liability insurance policies of the Company.
For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
as applicable shall cause the Final Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under each indemnification Contract listed in Section 6.11 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule between the Company and/or its applicable
Subsidiaries and any of their applicable current or former directors and
officers (each an "Indemnified Person"). In addition, for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Final
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to) cause the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Final Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall
not, unless required by Applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who were covered by such provisions.

(b) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her Representatives and in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise. If Parent or the Final Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such
consolidation or merger or  



 

66  (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of such surviving corporation shall expressly
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Final Surviving Entity set
forth in this Section 6.11. Parent shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to
in this Section 6.11 in connection with their enforcement of their rights
provided in this Section 6.11 and shall unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any
and all amounts payable under this Section 6.11.

Section 6.12 _Tax Treatment as Reorganization_

(a) Each of Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries and the Company intends, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the First Step Merger and
the Second Step Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Parties hereto adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

(b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, the Merger
Subsidiaries and the Company shall report the First Step Merger and the Second
Step Merger, taken together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(c) Each of Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries and the Company agrees to use
all commercially reasonable efforts in order for the Company to obtain a
written tax opinion from its tax counsel (as specified in Section 7.3(d)), in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to them, dated as of the Closing
Date to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, for United States
federal income tax purposes, the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger,
taken together, will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (the "Tax Opinion"). As a condition precedent to
the rendering of such Tax Opinions, Parent (and the Merger Subsidiaries) and
the Company shall, as of the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Dechert LLP
or Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (or such other nationally-recognized
law firm as Parent or the Company may select in lieu thereof), officers
certificates, dated and executed as of the dates of such Tax Opinion (the
"Tax Representation Letters"), in substantially the forms attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit B and Exhibit C, respectively. In rendering the Tax
Opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on customary assumptions and
representations reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, including
representations set forth in the Tax Representation Letters.

(d) If for any reason, including any payments required to be made to any
holders of Dissenting Shares, the First Step Merger and the Second Step
Merger, taken together, will not satisfy the "continuity of interest"
requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e), necessary to qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, then,
if requested by the Company, the Maximum Cash Amount shall be reduced only to
the extent as is necessary for the First Step Merger and the Second Step
Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the calculations in Section 2.5 shall be re-
calculated taking into account such reduced Maximum Cash Amount; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall the Maximum Stock Amount be exceeded.

  

 

67 Section 6.13 _Third Party Consents and Assignments_. As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, approvals,
assignments and waivers under any of its Contracts set forth in Section 4.4(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 4.17(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. In connection with seeking such consents, approval,
assignments and waivers, each of Parent and the Company shall keep the other
party informed of all material developments; _provided, _ that neither party
shall be obligated to pay any amount or make any material amendment to any
such agreement to obtain any such consent. Such consents, approvals,
assignments and waivers shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. In
the event the Merger does not close for any reason, neither party shall have
any liability to the other party, its stockholders or any other Person for any
costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from either party seeking to
obtain such consents, approvals, assignments and waivers.

Section 6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or similar
law becomes applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), each of (i) Parent and the Merger
Subsidiaries and their Boards of Directors, and (ii) subject to Section 6.5,
the Company and its Board of Directors, shall take all commercially
reasonable action necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of Company Stock (including any derivative securities with
respect to such shares) by each Person who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. 

Section 6.16 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent of the resignations of each of (i) the directors of the Company from
the Board of Directors of the Company and all committees thereof and (ii) the
officers of the Company, such resignations to be effective as of the
Effective Time.

Section 6.17 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing upon the Effective Time
on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.

Section 6.18 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholders litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no settlement of any such
litigation shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



 

68 Section 6.19 _Regulatory Filings_

(a) Without limiting the generality of the obligations of the parties pursuant
to Section 6.5 and subject to Section 6.5(b), Parent and the Company shall
collectively determine whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority by any party hereto or any Subsidiary thereof is
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the parties hereto will reasonably cooperate with each
other in seeking and obtaining any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings or furnishing information required in
connection therewith. To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties or
their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of
the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the
other and each of their respective Subsidiaries that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that confidential competitively sensitive
business information may be redacted from such exchanges. Each of the Company
and Parent promptly shall notify and provide a copy to the other party of any
written communication received from any Governmental Authority with respect to
any filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and
any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such filing or any such transaction. To the extent
reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or conversation
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the
opportunity to the other party to attend or participate. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the parties to this Agreement will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearance,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection with
Proceedings under or related to the HSR Act.

(b) The parties (i) shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and state securities or applicable
Blue Sky Laws in connection with the Merger and (ii) shall promptly prepare
and file all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions and filings, and use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all necessary consents from any Governmental Entities necessary to
consummate the Merger. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other
with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than the portions of such filings that include confidential information
not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

73  of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
prior to the earlier of (x) the Outside Date and (y) twenty (20) Business
Days after Parent receives written notice of such breach from the Company;
_provided, however,_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate

become void and of no effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on
the part of Parent, the Merger Subsidiaries or the Company (or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives) hereunder; _provided,
however,_ that the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 6.6(b) and Section
8.3, ARTICLE 9 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; and provided,
further, that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or

this Agreement, including any willful failure to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other Parties. In no event shall any
Party be liable for punitive damages.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_

by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount equal to $8.5 million (such
amount, the "Company Termination Fee") as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days after such termination). If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), then, in the
event that, (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
such termination any Third Party shall have publicly made, publicly proposed
or publicly disclosed an intention to make a bona fide Acquisition Proposal,
which bona fide Acquisition Proposal was not retracted or rescinded prior to
such termination and (ii) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (for this purpose, substituting "fifty
percent (50%)" for each reference to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Company Termination Fee, such
payment to be made promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
after the consummation of, such Acquisition Proposal.



 

74 (b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, Parent and the Merger Subsidiaries would not
enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Company Termination
Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment Parent commences a legal
action which results in a judgment against the Company for all or any portion
of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) in connection with such action. In circumstances where a
Company Termination Fee is payable, upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or the
Merger Subsidiaries with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

or to such other address, facsimile number or electronic mail as such Party
may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the other Parties hereto.
All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed received
on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m.
on a Business Day in the place of receipt. Otherwise, any such notice,
request or communication shall be deemed to have been received on the next
succeeding Business Day in the place of receipt.

Section 9.2 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties of the Parties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (or the Schedules or Exhibits
attached hereto) shall survive the Effective Time. None of the covenants or
agreements of the Parties in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time,
other than (a) the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
ARTICLE 9, in ARTICLE 2 and in Section 6.7(c), Section 6.10 and Section 6.11
and (b) those other covenants and agreements contained herein (including for
the avoidance of doubt, those covenants and  



 

76  agreements contained in Section 6.12(a) and Section 6.12(b)) that by their
terms apply, or that are to be performed in whole or in part, after
the Effective Time, in each case which shall survive the consummation of the
Merger until fully performed.

Section 9.3 _Amendments and Waivers_

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended prior to the Effective Time
if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the
case of an amendment, by each Party; _provided, however,_ that, after approval
of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment that, by
Applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without
such stockholder approval.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Merger
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties under this
Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Parties contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the
other Parties or conditions to the obligations of the waiving Parties
contained herein; _provided, however,_ that after any approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no extension or waiver that, by
Applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,
requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without such
stockholder approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

Section 9.4  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, including Section 8.3, all costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring, or required to incur, such expenses, whether or not the
First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger are consummated.

Section 9.5  _Disclosure Schedule References_. The Parties hereto agree that
the disclosure of any fact or item in a particular Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to
be a disclosure with respect to (i) the representations and warranties of the
Company or Parent and the Merger Subsidiaries, respectively, that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representation or warranty of the Company or Parent and the Merger
Subsidiaries, respectively, that is contained in this Agreement, but only if
the relevance of such disclosure to such representation or warranty is
reasonably apparent. The inclusion of an item in either the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an
admission by either party that such item is material or represents a material
fact, event or circumstance, would or is likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, a Company Material Event or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, exceeds specified monetary thresholds or creates a measure
for, or further defines the meaning of, materiality or material adverse effect
 



 

77  and their correlative terms for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure on
any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule relating to a possible breach or violation of any contract or law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that a breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

Section 9.6 _Mutual Drafting; Headings_. Each Party has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the Parties. The captions, headings and table
of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

Section 9.7 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Parties in Interests_

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any such assignment shall be null and void; _provided, however,_ that Parent
and the Merger Subsidiaries may assign all or any of their rights (but not
their obligations) hereunder to one or more of their wholly-owned Affiliates
without obtaining any such consent, and Parent and the Final Surviving Entity
may assign all or any of their rights or obligations hereunder other than
under ARTICLE 2 and Section 6.11, after the Effective Time to any Person.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

(b) Except for the provisions of ARTICLE 2 and Section 6.11 (which shall each
inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting therefrom who are the intended
third party beneficiaries thereof), nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims and causes of
action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles that
would result in the application of any laws other than the laws of the State
of Delaware.

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out
of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each Party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in
respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or
 



 

78  relating to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
and agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, based upon
or related to this Agreement in any other court. Each Party hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon
or relating to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve process in accordance with Section 9.1, (b) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the service of process in any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement
or the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be properly served or
delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.1.

Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
that the Parties may enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, with all such matters to take place exclusively in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), and any such injunction shall be
in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled, at law or in
equity.

Section 9.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
the Schedules, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and the other instruments delivered pursuant hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Letter Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 9.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction such
term or other provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon a determination that any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the greatest extent possible.



 

79 Section 9.14 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile and in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement, and which shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by facsimile,
electronic mail or otherwise) to the other Parties. Until and unless each
Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties hereto,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication).
