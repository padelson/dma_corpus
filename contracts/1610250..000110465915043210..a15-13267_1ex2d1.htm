contemplated by this Agreement (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at the
offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Suite 4400,

(y) above shall be extended to July 1, 2015 if, prior to such date, the
Purchaser confirms in writing to the Company that it is working in good faith
to obtain the Debt Financing and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby on the terms hereof. The date of the Closing is referred to herein as
the " **Closing Date** ". On the Closing Date, and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger (the " **Certificate of
Merger** ") in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_, with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later
time as may be agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, shall be referred to herein as the "
**Effective Time** ").

 



 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated
in its entirety as set forth in Annex A to the Certificate of Merger, and as
so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with applicable law,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws;
_provided_ , however, that all references to "Rodeo Acquisition Corp." in such
bylaws shall refer to "Sheplers Holding Corporation".

 



      
 

 



 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold such position in accordance with the provisions
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, each to
hold such office in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.6 _Effect of the Merger on the Company Stock and Merger Sub_.

 



 

(a) _Effect on the Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
Company Stockholders, each class, series and subclass of Company Stock (other
than Company Stock held or owned by the Company and Dissenting Stock) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 2.6_ and elsewhere in
this Agreement, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted
automatically into the right to receive that portion of the Final Merger
Consideration as set forth herein and shall no longer be outstanding.

 



 

(i) Each class, series and subclass of Company Stock (other than Company Stock
held or owned by the Company and Dissenting Stock) that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive a portion of the Final Merger Consideration in accordance
with the Distribution Waterfall.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Dissenting Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive potential payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
in accordance with _Section 2.11_.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each Company
Stockholder (other than the Company in respect of treasury stock and other
than holders of Dissenting Stock) at the Effective Time, the amounts described
in this _Section 2.6(a)_ shall be calculated assuming that the Final Merger
Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Initial Consideration, and shall be
adjusted following the Closing as set forth herein. The amount to be paid to
each Company Stockholder for each class, series and subclass of Company Stock
(other than the Company in respect of treasury stock and other than holders of
Dissenting Stock) held shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

(iv) All classes, series and subclasses of Company Stock, when cancelled,
extinguished, and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.6(a)_, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and
each former holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration provided for in this
_Section 2.6(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub s Capital Stock_. At and as of the Effective
Time, each share of Merger Subs capital stock shall be converted into one
share of the Surviving Corporations capital stock. Each certificate of Merger
Sub evidencing ownership of any such capital stock shall automatically be
deemed to evidence ownership of such interests of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Any Company Stock that is owned by the
Company and not issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

2.7 _Mechanism of Payment and Delivery of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) Not less than five days prior to the Effective Time, the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders (other than holders of
Dissenting Stock)) shall appoint a bank or trust company (which bank or trust
company shall have a credit rating of at least AA) to act as paying agent ("
**Paying Agent** ") and enter into a paying agent agreement with such Paying
Agent for the purpose of paying the Final Merger Consideration in accordance
with the Distribution Waterfall. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser
or Merger Sub shall deliver, or Purchaser or Merger Sub shall otherwise take
all steps necessary to cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Paying Agent solely for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders (other than the holders of Dissenting Stock), cash in an
aggregate amount equal to the Aggregate Initial Consideration (less the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund and any amounts otherwise payable to
Company Stockholders that have not delivered an executed Letter of Transmittal
in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_) (the " **Payment Fund** "). In the event
that any Company Stockholder delivers an executed Letter of Transmittal
pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ after the delivery of the Payment Fund to the
Paying Agent, then Purchaser or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Paying Agent
for deposit in the Payment Fund the additional amount(s) payable to such
Company Stockholder. The Payment Fund shall be used solely and exclusively for
purposes of paying the consideration specified in _Section 2.6_ and shall not
be used to satisfy any other obligations of any member of the Company Group.
The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided for in _Section 2.6_ out of
the Payment Fund. After paying such amounts and delivering such Payment Fund
to the Paying Agent, neither Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any Liability to any Person for the
allocation of such amounts among the Company Stockholders, who shall look
solely to the Paying Agent and the Sellers Representative for the payment and
delivery of such items.

 



 

(b) To the extent that a Company Stockholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Stock) delivers (i) a Letter of Transmittal substantially in the
form of _Exhibit D_ hereto (a " **Letter of Transmittal** "), duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (ii) a
certificate representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company
Stock (a " **Certificate** ") or a lost stock affidavit and indemnity (as
described in _Section 2.7(d)_) to the Company prior to the Closing, the
Paying Agent shall pay to such Company Stockholder at the Closing cash in an
amount set forth for such Company Stockholder in the Distribution Waterfall,
which amounts shall be paid by the Paying Agent by check or wire transfer in
accordance with the instructions provided by such Company Stockholder.
Following the Closing, upon surrender by a

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Stock) to Purchaser of
a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the Paying Agent shall
pay to such Company Stockholder, as soon as practicable but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after such surrender, in exchange therefor, cash
in an amount set forth for such Company Stockholder in the Distribution
Waterfall, which amounts shall be paid by check or wire transfer in accordance
with the instructions provided by such Company Stockholder. No interest or
dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the
surrender or transfer of any Certificate. If the consideration provided for
herein is to be delivered in the name of a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate was surrendered, it shall be a condition of such
delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer, including all transfer fees and taxes
paid. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.7(b)_, each Certificate (other than those representing Dissenting Shares or
Company Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_) shall represent,
for all purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the Final Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.6(a)_ in respect of the Company Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, without any interest or dividends thereon.

 



 

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a
holder of Certificates or any other Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered or
transferred by immediately prior to such date on which any Final Merger
Consideration, dividends (whether in cash, stock or property) or other
distributions with respect to Company Stock in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any foreign, federal,
state or local governments or Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) of that fact by the Person (who shall be
the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the portion of Final Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the owner of such lost Certificate shall not be entitled to any portion of the
Final Merger Consideration unless and until such owner executes and delivers a
Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_.

 



 

2.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Stock_. The portion of the
Final Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock, and, upon
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

2.9 _Repaid Indebtedness; Sellers  Transaction Expenses_. It is contemplated
by the parties that, upon the Closing, all Indebtedness of the Company Group
as of the Closing Date set forth on the attached " _Repaid Indebtedness
Schedule_ " will be fully repaid (the " **Repaid Indebtedness** ") and that
such repayment will be funded by Purchaser. In order to facilitate such
repayment, prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain (a) payoff letters
in form and in substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser for all Repaid
Indebtedness of the Company Group, which payoff letters shall, among other
matters, acknowledge the aggregate principal amount and all premiums,
prepayment penalties, accrued but unpaid interest and fees and expenses
constituting the Repaid Indebtedness and the release of related Liens
including the related UCC and other filings and return of collateral upon
payment in full thereof (to the extent required), and (b) take all actions as
may be required or reasonably requested by Purchaser or Merger Sub in
connection with the repayment of all Repaid Indebtedness (and any guarantees
with respect thereto). In addition, it is contemplated by the parties hereto
that, upon the Closing, all of the Sellers Transaction Expenses (to the
extent not paid by the Company Group prior to the Closing) will be fully paid,
and that such payment will be funded by Purchaser. In order to facilitate such
repayment, prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain payoff letters or
releases from each of the recipients of payments of Sellers Transaction
Expenses (including holders of Phantom Rights) (it being agreed that the
Letter of Transmittal is reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser with respect to
holders of Phantom Rights), which payoff letters or releases shall set forth
the full amount due to each such recipient. Subject to the satisfaction of the
Company Groups conditions, covenants and obligations to be satisfied prior to
the Closing, in connection with the Closing, Purchaser shall make payment of
any Sellers Transaction Expenses that are due and payable on the Closing Date
(including payments in respect of Phantom Rights) on the Closing Date in order
to discharge the amounts payable thereunder.

 



 

2.10 _Working Capital and Cash Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Determination of Closing Adjustment_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Purchaser with a good
faith estimate of Working Capital as of the close of business on the day prior
to the Closing Date (" **Estimated Working Capital** ") (prepared in
accordance with the " _Working Capital Schedule_ " attached hereto), a good
faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Cash of the Company Group as of
the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date (" **Estimated
Cash** "), Estimated Transaction Expenses and Estimated Indebtedness and the
amount by which the Aggregate Initial Consideration is to be adjusted on
account thereof. Such estimates shall be subject to the good faith review and
comment of Purchaser, and the Company shall consider any comments in good
faith and shall provide Purchaser and its representatives and advisors with
reasonable access to all relevant records and work papers (subject to, in the
event that the applicable parties have not already done so, the execution by
Purchaser and its representatives and advisors of a customary access agreement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) of the Company and its Subsidiary and its
representatives and advisors to allow Purchaser to review such estimates;
_provided_ that Purchasers approval of the foregoing estimates shall not be a
condition to, or affect the timing of, Closing. Prior to Closing, the Company
shall conduct a physical inventory (with the cost thereof to be shared equally
between the Company and the Purchaser) in accordance with GAAP using the same
accounting principles, practices and methodologies used in preparation of the
Audited

 



      
 

 



 

Financial Statements, at all facilities and warehouses of the Company Group
where inventory is owned and located, on such date(s) as reasonably determined
by the Company as close to the Closing Date as is reasonably practicable
(taking into account factors such as disruption to its normal operations). The
physical count shall be used by Purchaser as the basis for determining
inventory in the Actual Working Capital (it being understood that, if the
physical count of inventory is conducted on any day other than the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, then there shall be a bring down of the
results of such physical count as of the close of business on the day prior to
the Closing Date).

 



 

(b) _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers Representative
the calculation of the actual Working Capital as of the close of business on
the day prior to the Closing Date (" **Actual Working Capital** ") (prepared
in accordance with the " _Working Capital Schedule_ " attached hereto) and a
calculation of (i) the actual Cash of the Company Group as of the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date (" **Actual Cash** "); (ii) the
actual Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (" **Actual Indebtedness** "); and
(iii) the actual Sellers Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date ("
**Actual Transaction Expenses** ").

 



 

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) No later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Transaction Expenses, the Sellers Representative shall notify
Purchaser in writing whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Transaction Expenses. During such thirty (30) day period, the Sellers
Representative and its agents shall be provided with all relevant records and
work papers (subject to the execution by Sellers Representative and its
agents of a customary access agreement reasonably acceptable to Sellers
Representative) of the Company Group and its representatives and advisors to
enable it to evaluate the Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses. If the Sellers Representative
accepts the calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses determined pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)_, or if the Sellers Representative fails within such thirty (30) day
period to notify Purchaser of any dispute with respect thereto, then the
calculation of Actual Working Capital determined pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)_ shall be the " **Final Working Capital** " and the calculation of
Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses determined
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be the " **Final Cash** ", " **Final
Indebtedness** " and " **Final Transaction Expenses** " which, in each case,
shall be deemed final and conclusive and binding.

 



 

(ii) If the Sellers Representative disputes the accuracy of the calculation
of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness or Actual
Transaction Expenses, the Sellers Representative shall provide written notice
to Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by
Purchaser to the Sellers Representative of the calculation of Actual Working
Capital, Actual Cash, Actual

 



       
 

 



 

Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses (the " **Dispute Notice** "),
setting forth those items that the Sellers Representative disputes. During
the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall negotiate in good faith with a view to
resolving their disagreements over the disputed items. During such thirty (30)
day period and until the final determination of Actual Working Capital, Actual
Cash, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses in accordance with
this _Section 2.10(c)(ii)_ or _Section 2.10(c)(iii)_, as the case may be (as
so determined, or as determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(i)_ above, "
**Final Working Capital** ", " **Final Cash** ", " **Final Indebtedness** "
and " **Final Transaction Expenses** " respectively), the Sellers
Representative and its agents shall be provided with all relevant records and
work papers (subject to the execution by Sellers Representative and its
agents of a customary access agreement reasonably acceptable to Sellers
Representative) of the Company Group and its representatives and advisors. If
the parties resolve their differences over the disputed items in accordance
with the foregoing procedure, Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses shall be the amounts agreed upon
by them. If the parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed
items within such thirty (30) day period, then Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall forthwith jointly request that KPMG LLP (the "
**Accounting Arbitrator** ") make a binding determination as to the disputed
items in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will under the terms of its engagement have no
more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than ten (10)
Business Days from the final written submission of information by Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative within which to render its written decision
with respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any unresolved
disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and the final calculation of
Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness or Actual Transaction
Expenses shall be based solely on the resolution of such disputed items. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall review such written submissions and base its
determination in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value
to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either
party or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either party.
The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final and binding
upon the parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction and
the Accounting Arbitrators final calculation of Actual Working Capital shall
be deemed the " **Final Working Capital** " and the Accounting Arbitrators
final calculation of Actual Cash, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Transaction
Expenses shall be deemed " **Final Cash** ", " **Final Indebtedness** ", and "
**Final Transaction Expenses** " respectively. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to be paid by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Sellers (based on each such Persons Applicable Percentage), on
the other, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses_.

 



 

(i) Following the determination of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses, the Aggregate Initial
Consideration shall be recalculated by substituting the Final Working Capital
for the Estimated Working Capital in _Section 1.1_, the Final Cash for the
Estimated Cash in _Section 1.1_, the Final Indebtedness for the Estimated
Indebtedness in _Section 1.1_ and the Final Transaction Expenses for the
Estimated Transaction Expenses in _Section 1.1_ (the " **Adjusted Aggregate
Initial Consideration** ") and if (after taking into account any Upward
Closing Working Capital Adjustment or Downward Closing Working Capital
Adjustment at the Closing) (A) the Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration is
greater than the Aggregate Initial Consideration on the Closing Date, then
such difference shall be paid by Purchaser to the Sellers Representative (for
the benefit of the Sellers in accordance with such Persons Applicable
Percentage) and (B) the Aggregate Initial Consideration on the Closing Date is
greater than the Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration (such difference,
the " **Shortfall Amount** "), then such Shortfall Amount shall be paid from
the Merger Consideration Adjustment Escrow Fund to Purchaser, and the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and Purchaser shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to release to Purchaser from the Merger Consideration
Adjustment Escrow Fund the Shortfall Amount; _provided_ , that if the
Shortfall Amount exceeds the Merger Consideration Adjustment Escrow Amount,

required or appropriate under the terms of the Phantom Rights Plan, such
401(k) Plan, or such other Employee Plans.

 



 

(b) _Section 280G Matters_.

 



 

(i) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make any
payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances
could obligate it to make any payments, that would or may not be deductible
under Section 280G of the Code if the stockholder approval requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not satisfied, then the Company shall,
prior to the Closing, submit for approval, pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder and in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, by the stockholders of the Company entitled to
vote, any payments and/or benefits to any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that may be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code (" **Potential 280G Benefits** "), and, prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser either that (i) the requisite stockholder approval
was obtained, or (ii) no Potential 280G Benefits will be payable or retained,
including by reason that the individual or individuals entitled to such
payments elected to sign waivers forfeiting any payments or benefits that may
be deemed to constitute "parachute payments".

 



 

(ii) To the extent that any contract, agreement, or plan is entered into by
Purchaser, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
Affiliates and a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
before the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide a copy of such contract,
agreement or plan to the Company and the Stockholders Representative at least
five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date and shall cooperate with the
Company in good faith in order to calculate or determine the value (for the
purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or benefits granted or
contemplated therein, which are reasonably expected to be paid or granted in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could
constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(c) The Company Group shall, prior to the Closing Date, use commercially
reasonable efforts to file all Form 5500 Annual Returns/Reports of Employee
Benefit Plan and any required schedules and attachments for each of the
Employee Plans that are delinquent and have not been timely filed with the
Department of Labor pursuant to Title I of ERISA, pursuant to and in
accordance with the Department of Labors Delinquent Filer Voluntary
Compliance Program, and

 



      
 

 



 

pay all associated penalties. The costs incurred by the Company Group,
including but not limited to any filing fees, penalties, printing costs,
distribution costs and legal fees, in connection with such actions shall be
included as Sellers Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(d) Following the end of the 12-month period ending July 29, 2015, Purchaser
will determine whether amounts are payable under the Sheplers Fiscal Year 2015
Management Bonus Plan and the Sheplers Fiscal Year 2015 Store Managers Bonus
Plan (the " **Plans** "), which determination shall be consistent with past
practice (and, notwithstanding the sale to Purchaser, shall as closely as
reasonably possible reflect the costs and expenses that would have been
incurred had the Company remained a standalone entity though July 29, 2015).
Bonuses under the 2015 Plans, if any, shall be paid no later than October 1,
2015. Participants in the Plans shall be limited to those employees who were
employed by the Company Group as of the Closing, other than those who are not
employed with the Company Group through the date bonuses are paid as a result
of a termination for cause or a voluntary resignation.

Financing Sources to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company, or impose any liability on the Company
prior to the Closing (other than in the case of a breach by the Company of

and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained, (iv) neither

written supplement to any schedules referenced herein, from time to time,

reflect any event, condition, fact or circumstance that becomes known to the
Company after the date hereof and that would cause any inaccuracy in or breach
of a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company (an " **Updated
Schedule** "). An Updated Schedule shall not be taken into account for
purposes of _Section 3.2_ or _8.1_ and shall not diminish the Purchaser
Indemnitees right to make indemnification claims pursuant to _Section 8.1_
or Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_
with respect to any matters disclosed in such Updated Schedule.

 



 

4.11 _Support Agreements_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each Seller that did not enter into the Support Agreement as of the date

As a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Organization and Power; Subsidiaries and Investments_.

 



 

(a) Each member of the Company Group is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each
member of the Company Group has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Except as set
forth on the attached " _Capitalization Schedule,_ " no member of the Company
Group owns or controls (directly or indirectly) any stock, partnership

interest in any other Person.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on the attached " _Corporate Organization Schedule,_ "
each member of the Company Group is qualified to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good

 



      
 

 



 

standing in each jurisdiction listed on the attached " _Corporate Organization
Schedule,_ " which jurisdictions constitute all of the jurisdictions in which
the ownership of properties or the conduct of the Business requires such
member of the Company Group to be so qualified, except to the extent the
failure to qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each member of the Company Group has all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted. The organizational
documents of each member of the Company Group, which have previously been
furnished to Purchaser, reflect all amendments thereto, and are correct and
complete in all material respects. No member of the Company Group is in
default or violation of any of the provisions of its organizational documents.

 



 

5.2 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company
Group of this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and each of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the members of the Company Group, as the case may be, and no
other act or proceeding on the part of any member of the Company Group, their
respective governing bodies or stockholders is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery or performance by the Company Group of this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than the Written Consent.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby by the other parties hereto and thereto, this
Agreement constitutes, and the other agreements contemplated hereby upon
execution and delivery by the members of the Company Group, as applicable,
will each constitute, a valid and binding obligation of such member of the
Company Group, enforceable against such Person in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally, and (b) applicable equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

5.3 _Capitalization_. The attached " _Capitalization Schedule_ " accurately
sets forth the authorized and outstanding equity of each member of the Company
Group and the name and number of equity interests held by each stockholder
thereof. All of the issued and outstanding equity of each member of the
Company Group has been validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable and were
not issued in violation of applicable law. The Company owns all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of its Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens
except for Permitted Liens. None of the shares of Company Stock were issued in
violation of any agreement, arrangement or commitment to which the Company is
a party or is subject to or in violation of any preemptive or similar rights
of any Person. Except for this Agreement and as may be set forth on the
attached " _Capitalization Schedule_ ," there are no outstanding or authorized
options, warrants, rights, contracts, pledges, calls, puts, rights to
subscribe, conversion rights or other agreements or commitments to which any
member of the Company Group is a party or which is binding upon any member of
the Company Group providing for (i) the issuance, disposition or acquisition
of any of its equity or any rights or interests exercisable, convertible, or
exchangeable therefor or (ii) any voting or other rights with respect to the
equity of any member of the Company Group. Except as set forth on the attached
" _Capitalization Schedule_ ," there are no outstanding or authorized equity
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with respect to any member of
the Company Group. All of the Restricted Shares and the Phantom Rights that
have not been effectively and validly

 



      
 

 



 

cancelled or repurchased prior to the date hereof will be fully vested upon
the Effective Time. The treatment of the phantom rights agreements and Phantom
Rights Plan set out in this Agreement is consistent with the terms of said
Phantom Rights Plan and the applicable phantom rights agreement in all
respects. The Distribution Waterfall is accurate and correct in all respects
and has been prepared in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Company Charter and Bylaws and each other Company document relating to the
distribution of proceeds or payments of other amounts. All accrued and unpaid
dividends on any Company Stock of the Company shall be paid in full as part of
the Distribution Waterfall. The attached " _Capitalization Schedule_ " sets
forth, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, a true and correct list of
all amounts payable by the Company, including amounts held in a Company Escrow
Account (as defined in those certain letter agreements, dated on or about

Company Stock solely for Purchasers own account, for investment purposes
only, and not with a view to, or with any present intention of, reselling or
otherwise distributing the Company Stock or dividing its participation herein
with others. Purchaser understands and acknowledges that (a) none of the
Company Stock have been registered or qualified under the Securities Act, or
under any securities laws of any state of the United States or other
jurisdiction, in reliance upon specific exemptions thereunder for transactions
not involving any public offering, (b) all of the Company Stock constitute
"restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (c)
none of the Company Stock is traded or tradable on any securities exchange or

Purchaser will not transfer or otherwise dispose any of the Company Stock
acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that may cause any

state securities laws. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act.

 



 

6.6 _Brokerage_. There are no claims for brokerage commissions, finders fees
or similar compensation in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based on any arrangement or agreement made or alleged to have
been made by or on behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub (or their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents), except as set forth on the attached
" _Purchaser Brokerage Schedule_ ".

 



 

6.7 _Financing_. Attached hereto as the " _Financing Commitments Schedule_ "
are true and correct copies of the executed debt commitment letters (including
the summary of terms and conditions attached thereto), each dated on or prior
to the date hereof, from each of GCI Capital Markets LLC and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, and acknowledged by Purchaser (as amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified or replaced from time to time, the " **Debt Commitment
Letters** "), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed,
subject only to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letters are (i) legal,
valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto and
(ii) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Purchaser
and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Merger Sub, each of the
other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, none of the Debt Commitment
Letters has been amended or modified, and the respective obligations and
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect, and the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force
and effect. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 5_ in all material
respects, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser or Merger Sub or to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Merger Sub, any
other parties

 



      
 

 



 

thereto, under the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, to
Knowledge of each of Purchaser and Merger Sub there is no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not
be made available to Purchaser and Merger Sub at the Closing. The aggregate
proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with the unrestricted cash on hand
of Purchaser, will be sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be
provided by Purchaser and Merger Sub for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of Purchasers
and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of
all amounts to be paid by Purchaser and Merger Sub pursuant to Article 2 and
the payment of all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent payable on or prior to the Closing
(including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness and the payment of
Sellers Transaction Expenses as contemplated herein). Except for fee letters
with respect to fees relating to the Debt Financing, of which Purchaser has
delivered true, correct and complete redacted copies to the Company prior to
the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As
of the date hereof, Purchaser and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees which are due and payable on
or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters. Other than as set forth on the _Violations Schedule_ , as of the date
hereof, no "Default" or "Event of Default" (as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) has occurred as of the date hereof, and no condition equivalent to
an "Event of Default" has occurred as of the date hereof and is continuing
that gives rise to the rights of the lenders under the Existing Credit
Agreement to accelerate the obligations thereunder. Purchaser has sufficient
cash on hand or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to
make payment of the Purchaser Fee if such payment is required pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_. The payment of the Purchaser Fee by Purchaser will not
result in a default under the Existing Credit Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Due Diligence Review_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges
that: (a) it has completed to its satisfaction its own due diligence review
with respect to the Company Group and it is entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based on such investigation and the
representations made by the Company in _Article 5_ and, except for the
specific representations and warranties made by the Company in _Article 5_,
it is not relying upon any representation or warranty of any member of the
Company Group or any Affiliate thereof or any officer, director, employee,
agent or advisor, or any of them, nor, except for the specific representations
and warranties made by the Company in _Article 5_, upon the accuracy of any
record, projection or statement made available or given to Purchaser or Merger
Sub in the performance of such investigation, (b) it has had access to its
full satisfaction to the Company Group and their respective books and records,
contracts, agreements and documents (including Tax Returns and related
documents), and employees, agents and representatives and (c) it has had such
opportunity to seek accounting, legal, tax or other advice or information in
connection with its entry into this Agreement and the other documents referred
to herein relating to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby as it has seen fit.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _Solvency_. As of the Closing, and after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing Documents,
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including each member of the Company Group)
will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 6.9_, " **Solvent** " means
that, with respect to any Person and as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person,
will, as of such date, exceed the amount of all "liabilities of such Person,
contingent or otherwise," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations
of the insolvency of debtors, (b) the present fair saleable value of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, be greater than the amount that
will be required to pay the liability of such Person on its indebtedness as
its indebtedness becomes absolute and matured, (c) such Person will not have,
as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct
its business and (d) such Person will be able to pay its indebtedness as it
matures. For purposes of the foregoing definition only, "indebtedness" means a
liability in connection with another Persons (x) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured or (y) right to any equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not
such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation hereunder on the part of any party hereto (other than
pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, the third sentence of _Section 8.3_ (Press
Releases and Announcements; Confidentiality), _Section 8.4_ (Expenses), and
_Article 9_ which shall survive any such termination), except for intentional
or willful breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

satisfied solely as a result of the breach of this Agreement by Purchaser or
Merger Sub), (ii) Purchaser and Merger Sub fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the date the Closing should have occurred

consummate such transactions on that date, the sole and exclusive remedy
available to the Company shall be termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_ and the payment of the Purchaser Fee pursuant to _Section

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Companys receipt and acceptance of the Purchaser Fee pursuant to this

contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries against Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Financing
Sources, and any of their respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
Affiliates, employees, representatives or agents for any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, in each case, in any circumstance in
which the Sellers Representative is permitted to terminate this Agreement and
cause the Company to receive the Purchaser Fee pursuant to _Sections 7.2(b)_
and _(c)_ , and upon the Companys receipt of such amounts, none of Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current,
or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates, employees, representatives or agents shall
have any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this

Gryphon Partners III, L.P., to the Gryphon Indemnity Guarantee (as defined
below) contained in this _Section 8.1(a)(i)_, from and after the Closing,
each of the Sellers (collectively, the " **Seller Indemnitors** "), severally
and not jointly, in proportion to the applicable percentage set forth on the
attached " _Sellers Holdings Schedule_ " (the " **Applicable Percentage** "),
agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the members of the Company Group) and their respective officers,

representatives (collectively, the " **Purchaser Indemnitees** ") in respect
of any loss, Liability, fine, penalty, deficiency, damage or expense
(including reasonable legal

 



      
 

 



 

expenses and costs) but excluding consequential, special, punitive, indirect,
or exemplary damages and excluding any damages measured by a multiple of
earnings (except, in each case, to the extent such damages are awarded to an
unaffiliated third party) (a " **Loss** ") which such Purchaser Indemnitee
suffers as a result of: (A) the breach by the Company of any representation or
warranty contained in _Article 5_ (disregarding all qualifications as to
"materiality" and "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein other than those
set forth in _Sections 5.5(a)_ , _5.6(a)_ , _5.10(a)_ (first sentence),
_5.11_ (first and second sentences), _5.16(d)_ , and _5.19(c)_ ) as of the

covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement required to be performed by
the Company prior to Closing; (C) all Taxes of the Company Group for all
Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through

joined (or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date; (E) the
exercise of appraisal or dissenters rights by any Company Stockholder (it
being agreed that only Losses in excess of the amount such Person would have

respect thereof and not exercised such appraisal or dissenters rights shall
constitute a Loss); and (F) the matters described in Section (a) of the "
_Special Indemnity Schedule_ "; _provided_ , however, that in the case of
clauses (C) and (D) above, the Seller Indemnitors shall be liable only to the
extent such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, of such Taxes included

Transaction Expenses. Any amount payable to any Purchaser Indemnitee by any
Seller Indemnitor for indemnification under this Agreement (other than with
respect to the matters set forth in Section (a)(1) of the _Special Indemnity
Schedule_ ) shall be satisfied (i) first, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund
and then (ii) second, directly from such Seller Indemnitor. Any amount payable
to any Purchaser Indemnitee by any Seller Indemnitor for indemnification with

second, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund and then (iii) third, directly
from such Seller Indemnitor. Notwithstanding that each Seller shall only be

Indemnitee, Gryphon Partners III, L.P. (the " **Guarantor** ") hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees (the " **Gryphon Indemnity
Guarantee** ") to Purchaser and each Purchaser Indemnitee the due and punctual
observance, performance, and discharge of the indemnification obligations of
each of the Management Sellers under this _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ (the "
**Guaranteed Obligations** "). The Gryphon Indemnity Guarantee is a guaranty
of payment and not of collection. Guarantor hereby waives to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, for the benefit of each Purchaser
Indemnitee, and covenants and agrees not to assert or attempt to enforce: (a)
any right to require Purchaser or Merger Sub, as a condition of payment or
performance by Guarantor, to (i) proceed first against the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any other Person or (ii) pursue any other remedy in the power of
any Purchaser Indemnitee whatsoever; (b) any defense arising by reason of the

law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in
amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal and

conflict with the terms hereof; (d) (i) any principles or provisions of law,
statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms
hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of Guarantors obligations
hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting
Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to
set offs, recoupments and counterclaims and (iv) promptness, diligence and any
requirement that any Purchaser Indemnitee protect, secure, perfect or insure
any security interest or Lien or any property subject thereto; (e) notices,
demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of
default hereunder or under this Agreement notices of any renewal, extension or
modification of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement related thereto,
and any right to consent to any thereof; (f) notice of any default under this
Agreement or (g) any right or defense arising by reason of any claim or
defense base upon an election of remedies by any Purchaser Indemnitee,
including any defense based upon an impairment or elimination of Guarantors
rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnity.

 



 

(ii) Any claims by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 8_ must
be made in writing to the Sellers Representative on or before the Seller
Survival Date, it being understood that so long as such written notice is
given on or prior to the Seller Survival Date, such representations and
warranties and covenants that are the subject of such claim shall continue to
survive until such matter is resolved. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Seller Survival Date** " shall mean the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Seller Survival Date
with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
5.1(a)_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.4(a)_ , or _5.20_ , (collectively, the "
**Fundamental Representations** ") shall mean the fourth (4th) anniversary of
the Closing Date; _provided further_ that the Seller Survival Date with
respect to (i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.17_
and Losses pursuant to _Sections 8.1(a)(i)(C)_ , _(D)_ and _(E)_ shall be 30
days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such
matters, (ii) Losses pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(i)(F)_ with respect to
Section (a)(1) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_ shall mean the first

indemnification pursuant to (a) _Section 8.1(a)(i)(A)_ and _Section
8.1(a)(i)(F)_ with regard to Section (a)(2) of the _Special Indemnity
Schedule_ shall not exceed an amount equal to $8,820,000 _less_ the aggregate
amount of all payments made to the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(i)(F)_ with regard to Section (a)(1) of the _Special Indemnity
Schedule_ other than payments satisfied from the Special Escrow Fund (but
including the Indemnification Escrow Fund) and (b) _Section 8.1(a)(i)(F)_

and _Section 8.1(a)(i)(F)_ with regard to Section (a)(2) of the _Special
Indemnity Schedule_ (including from the Indemnification Escrow Fund or Special
Escrow Fund).

 



 

(B) None of the Seller Indemnitors shall be liable to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(i)(A)_ (other than for the breach of
a Fundamental Representation or the representations and warranties contained
in _Section 5.17_ or fraud) unless and until such Purchaser Indemnitee has
collectively suffered Losses as a result of breaches in excess of $735,000 in
the aggregate (the " **Indemnification Basket** ") (the Seller Indemnitors
being obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees solely to the extent
exceeding the Indemnification Basket); _provided_ that, the Seller Indemnitors
shall not be liable to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(i)(A)_ (other than for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or the representations and warranties contained in _Section
5.17_ or fraud), unless and until such Purchaser Indemnitee has suffered
aggregate Losses arising out of a claim or a related group of claims arising
out of the same facts, events or circumstances in excess of $50,000 (provided
that any claim not exceeding such amount shall not be aggregated to count
towards the Indemnification Basket).

 



 

(C) Except with respect to Losses attributable to a breach of the
representation set forth in _Section 5.17(b)(vii)_ (excluding any Losses
attributable to any corporate restructuring taken by the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company Group) on or after the Closing Date),
any Losses claimed by the Purchaser Indemnitees for a breach of

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty set forth in _Section 5.17_ or otherwise with
respect to Taxes shall be limited to Losses incurred with respect to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end
of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained here, in no event will
any Seller Indemnitor be liable for any Losses of the Purchaser Indemnitees
under or in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in an amount in excess of the proceeds actually received by such Seller
Indemnitor on account of the sale by such Person of its shares of Company
Stock hereunder (including for this purpose in the case of a Seller that was a
holder of Phantom Rights immediately prior to Closing, the aggregate payments
received by such Person in respect of such Phantom Rights).

 



 

(b) _Purchaser s Indemnification._

 



 

(i) Subject to the other limitations contained in this _Article 8_, from and
after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Sellers and, for Sellers who are entities, their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, partners (general and limited), agents and
representatives (collectively, the " **Seller Indemnitees** ") and hold each
Seller Indemnitee harmless against any Loss which any Seller Indemnitee
suffers, as a result of: (A) the breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of any
representation or warranty contained in _Article 6_ (disregarding all
qualifications as to "materiality" and "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein); and (B) the breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or the breach
by any member of the Company Group of any covenant or agreement of the Company
Group contained in this Agreement required to be performed by the Company
Group from and after the Closing.

 



 

(ii) Any claims by any Seller Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 8_ must be
made in writing to Purchaser on or before the Purchaser Survival Date, it
being understood that so long as such written notice is given on or prior to
the Purchaser Survival Date, such representations and warranties and covenants
which are required to be performed prior to the Closing that are the subject
of such claim shall continue to survive until such matter is resolved. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Purchaser Survival Date** " shall
mean the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the Purchaser Survival Date with respect to the
representations and warranties of Purchaser and Merger Sub set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ , _6.3(b)(i)_ , or _6.6_ shall mean the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) In the event that Purchaser is obligated to make an indemnification
payment hereunder, such payment shall be made to the Sellers Representative
on behalf of the applicable Seller Indemnitees for distribution thereto.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Notice of Claim_. Any indemnified party making a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ or _(b)_ (an " **Indemnified
Party** ") must give the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the case may
be, written notice of such claim describing such claim and the nature and
amount of such Loss, to the extent that the nature and amount thereof are
determinable at such time (a " **Claim Notice** ") promptly after the
Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim (a " **Proceeding** ") against or
involving the Indemnified Party by a third party; _provided_ that a failure to
notify or delay in notifying the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as the
case may be, will not relieve the indemnifying party (the " **Indemnifying
Party** ") of its obligations pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ or _(b)_ , except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result
thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. With respect to the defense of any
Proceeding against or involving an Indemnified Party in which the claimant
seeks only the recovery of a sum of money for which indemnification is
provided, at its option and expense the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead
counsel of such defense a legal counsel of national standing selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume control of the defense of any claim or negotiation of any settlement
(i) to the extent that the primary object of such claim for indemnification is
to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-
monetary relief against any Purchaser Indemnitee, (ii) the named parties to
any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both a
Purchaser Indemnitee and the Company or the Sellers and the former shall have
been advised in writing by outside legal counsel that there are one or more
legal or equitable defenses available to them that are different from or
additional to those available to the Company or the Sellers (in which event
each shall have the right to utilize counsel of their own choosing) or (iii)
if such action or proceeding involves, or could reasonably be expected to
involve liability that would constitute a material adverse effect on a
Purchaser Indemnitee.

 



 

(iii) _Control of Defense; Exceptions, etc._ The Indemnified Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own expense, with the
Indemnified Party obligated hereby to provide reasonable cooperation with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of claims or litigation, including by making
employees, information and documentation reasonably available.

 



 

(iv) _Settlement of Claims_. The Indemnifying Party must obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to entering into any settlement of any
claim or Proceeding or ceasing to defend any claim or Proceeding unless (a)
the proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by the
Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief
on the Indemnified Party and (b) the proposed

 



      
 

 



 

settlement provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such
claim, and the Indemnified Party will not settle any claim for which it has
sought or is seeking recovery from any member of the Company Group without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(v) To the extent that anything contained in this _Section 8.1(c)_ conflicts
with the provisions of _Section 8.9_, the provisions of _Section 8.9_ shall
control.

 



 

(d) _Net Recovery; Mitigation_. The amount of any Loss shall be net of any
amounts recovered (net of reasonably incurred costs of collection) by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under insurance policies, indemnities,
reimbursement arrangements, or contracts (including with respect to any
breaches thereof) with respect to such Loss, it being agreed that an
Indemnified Party shall be required to make a claim for recovery (including
providing any reasonably required follow up information) under any insurance
policy in force at the time of Loss with respect to any amount of Loss, if
there is a good faith basis for making such a claim but shall not be required
to litigate against any insurance company. Any Loss under this Agreement shall
be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Seller Indemnitors shall have no
liability under this Agreement with respect to any matter to the extent the
expense, loss or liability comprising the Loss (or a part thereof) with
respect to such matter has been taken into account in any adjustment to the
Aggregate Initial Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_. The parties
acknowledge that any right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
shall be subject to any duty to mitigate Losses imposed by applicable law.

 



 

(e) _Release of the Escrow Funds_. On the date which is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
direct the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers Representative (for the
benefit of the Sellers) the then-remaining amount of the Indemnification
Escrow Fund less the aggregate amount of all Losses specified in any then-
unresolved good faith claims for indemnification pursuant to the indemnities
set forth herein. On the date which is six months following the Closing Date,
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to
release to the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) the
then-remaining amount of the Special Escrow Fund less the aggregate amount of
all Losses specified in any then-unresolved good faith claims for
indemnification pursuant to the indemnities set forth herein.

 



 

(f) _Payments_. Any payment pursuant to an undisputed claim for
indemnification shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of written notice from the Indemnified Party stating
the amount of the claim, unless the claim is subject to defense as provided in
_Section 8.1(c)_ or is a dispute, claim or controversy which is the subject
of an unresolved litigation proceeding, in which case payment shall be made
not later than thirty (30) days after the amount of the claim is finally
determined or any such dispute is resolved.

 



 

(g) _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this
_Section 8.1_ (including any

 



      
 

 



 

agreement by any Company Stockholder to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal) shall be the exclusive remedy
of each party hereto and the Sellers with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including without limitation with respect to
any environmental, health or safety matters) (except for (x) claims of fraud,
(y) claims for equitable relief and disputes under _Section 2.10_, which
disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism
set forth in _Section 2.10_, and (z) claims under a Sellers Letter of
Transmittal). After the Closing Date, no party may seek the rescission of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

8.2 _Mutual Assistance_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
cooperate with the other parties hereto in the expeditious filing of all
notices, reports and other filings with any Governmental Authority required to
be submitted jointly by any of the parties hereto in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated
hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Subsequent to the Closing, each of the parties hereto, at the cost of
the requesting party, will assist the other parties hereto (including by the
retention of records and the provision of access to relevant records for a
period not to exceed six (6) years from the Closing Date) in the preparation
of their respective Tax Returns and the filing and execution of Tax elections,
if required, as well as in the defense of any audits or litigation that may
ensue as a result of the filing thereof, to the extent that such assistance is
reasonably requested.

 



 

8.3 _Press Release and Announcements; Confidentiality_. Unless required by any
applicable law, rule, regulation or stock exchange requirement (in which case
each of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, rule, regulatory or stock exchange requirement, consult with
the other party prior to any such disclosure as to the form and content of
such disclosure), from and after the date hereof, until the Closing Date, no
press releases, announcements to the employees, customers or suppliers of the
Business or other releases of information related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be issued or released except with the
consent of both Purchaser and the Sellers Representative. Subject to the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential, except (x) to the extent required by any applicable stock
exchange requirement or reporting requirement under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended from time to time, in each case as such exceptions are
applicable to Purchaser or its Affiliates, (y) that the parties may disclose
such terms to their respective investors, prospective investors, employees,

with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such
Persons agree to or are bound by contract or a professional obligation to keep
the terms of this Agreement confidential) and (z) to defend or maintain any
litigation in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that Purchaser and Merger Sub are subsidiaries of a public company

in accordance with its terms, except as modified by the provisions of this
_Section 8.3_. The parties hereto agree that such Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate automatically as of the Closing, except with respect to
confidential information regarding any of the Company Stockholders or their
respective Affiliates.

 



 

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall be solely responsible for and shall bear all of its own

(a) At the Closing, Gryphon Partners III, L.P. shall be constituted and
appointed as the Sellers Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Sellers **

 



      
 

 



 

 **Representative** " shall mean the representative, true and lawful agent,
proxy and attorney in fact of the Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, with full power and authority on such Sellers
behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) to pay
such Sellers expenses (whether incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred
in connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (iii) to
receive, give receipt and disburse any funds received hereunder on behalf of
or to such Seller and each other Seller and to holdback from disbursement any
such funds to the extent it reasonably determines may be necessary, (iv) to
execute and deliver any certificates representing the Company Stock and
execution of such further instruments as Purchaser shall reasonably request,
(v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller all documents contemplated
herein and any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) to take all other actions to
be taken by or on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith, (vii) to
negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all disputes under this
Agreement, including without limitation, disputes regarding Estimated Working
Capital and any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.10_ and all claims for
indemnification made by any Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_,
(viii) to waive any condition to the obligation of the Sellers to consummate
the transactions contemplated herein, (ix) to give and receive notices on
behalf of the Sellers, including without limitation, any notice of a claim for
which indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ and (x) to do
each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Seller is, or
the Sellers collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement. The Sellers, by approving the principal terms of the Merger
and/or accepting the consideration payable to them hereunder, irrevocably
grant unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and
perform each and every act and thing necessary or desirable to be done in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to
all intents and purposes as the Sellers might or could do in person. Each of
the Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest,
are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers Representative
and shall survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of any Seller.

 



 

(b) All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the Sellers
Representative shall be final and binding upon all the Sellers and no Seller
shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same, except for fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. Neither the Sellers
Representative nor any agent employed by Sellers Representative shall incur
any liability to any Seller relating to the performance of its duties
hereunder except for actions or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith or
willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in
respect of amounts actually received on behalf of such Seller. The Sellers
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Sellers shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative and any
accountants, attorneys or other agents whom the Sellers Representative may
retain to assist in carrying out Sellers Representatives duties hereunder.
The Sellers shall reimburse the Sellers Representative for all costs and
expenses, including professional fees, incurred.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Sellers Representative becomes unable to perform
the Sellers Representatives responsibilities or resigns from such position,
the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders holding, prior to the Closing, a majority of the Company Stock
shall select another representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted
representative shall (i) be deemed to be the Sellers Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise the rights and powers of, and be
entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and other benefits of, the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers
Representative an amount to be determined by the Sellers Representative, at
its reasonable discretion (the " **Sellers  Representative Expense Fund**")
to be held in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by
the Sellers Representative for its obligations in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. Any balance of the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes shall be
returned to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentage.

 



 

(f) Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation (i) shall be fully
protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, shall have no
Liability to the Company Stockholders with respect to, actions, decisions and
determinations of the Sellers Representative and (ii) shall be entitled to
assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Sellers
Representative are fully authorized by all of the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(g) _Sellers  Counsel_.

 



 

(i) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Company Group
and the Sellers Representative (and its Affiliates) have retained Kirkland and
Ellis LLP (" **Sellers  Counsel**") to act as their counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that Sellers Counsel has not
acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that no other party or Person has the status of a
client of the Sellers Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes
as a result thereof. All of the parties recognize the commonality of interest
that exists and will continue to exist until the Closing between the Company
Group, the Sellers Representative and Sellers Counsel, and the parties agree
that such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after the
Closing. Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises between Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates and Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates, Sellers
Counsel may represent Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of Sellers Representative or any of its
Affiliates may be directly adverse to Purchaser, any member of the Company
Group or any of their respective Affiliates and even though Sellers Counsel
may have represented a member of the Company Group in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Specifically, the parties agree that Purchaser shall
not, and shall not cause the Company Group to, and shall cause the Company
Group not to, seek to have Sellers Counsel disqualified from representing
Sellers Representative in connection with any dispute that may arise between
Sellers Representative and Purchaser or any member of the Company Group in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates hereby waive, on behalf
of themselves and each of their

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such representation by
Sellers Counsel. Each of Purchaser and the Company further agrees that, as to
all pre-Closing communications among Sellers Counsel, any member of the
Company Group and any Company Stockholder that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege,
the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege belong to Sellers Representative and its Affiliates, as applicable,
and may be controlled by Sellers Representative and its Affiliates and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates, subject in all cases to _Section 8.7(g)(ii)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with any dispute that may arise between
Sellers Representative and Purchaser or a member of the Company Group,
Sellers Representative (and not Purchaser or the Company Group) shall have
the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that
may apply to any communications between a member of the Company Group and
Sellers Counsel that occurred before the Closing, subject in all cases to
_Section 8.7(g)(ii)_. Purchaser and the Company agree to take, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the
intent of this _Section 8.7(g)_.

 



 

(ii) The parties further acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company Group
retained Sellers Counsel to provide legal services with respect to the
matters set forth in Section (a)(1)(i) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_ ,
(ii) Sellers Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person (other
than the Sellers Representative) in connection with matters described in
Section (a)(1)(i) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_ (iii) no other party or
Person (other than the Sellers Representative) has the status of a client of
the Sellers Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a
result thereof and (iv) Sellers Counsel desires to represent the Company
Group with respect to the matters described in Section (a)(1)(i) of the
_Special Indemnity Schedule_ after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in
_Section 8.7(g)(i)_ to the contrary, as to all pre-Closing communications
among Sellers Counsel, any member of the Company Group and any Company
Stockholder that relate in any way to the matters described in Section
(a)(1)(i) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_ (except for information relating
to the Sellers negotiations with potential bidders), the attorney-client
privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any
evidentiary privilege belong to Company Group, and may be controlled by the
Company Group (other than in connection with any proceeding between Sellers
Representative, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and/or the Company Group,
on the other hand). The Sellers Representative and the Company Stockholders
(a) waive any conflict related to or arising from Sellers Counsel undertaking
any representation of the Purchaser or the Company Group relating to the
matters described in Section (a)(1)(i) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_ and
(b) agree that they will not object, and hereby consent to, Sellers Counsel
representing Purchaser and the Company Group in any and all matters and
Sellers Counsel disclosing to Purchaser and the Company Group any and all
information, work product and communications relating to the matters described
in Section (a)(1)(i) of the _Special Indemnity Schedule_.

 



 

8.8 _Directors and Officers Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after
the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any member of the
Company Group (including

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation) to, amend, repeal or modify (in a manner adverse to
the beneficiary thereof) any provision in such Persons certificates of
incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or comparable
governing documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or
advancement of expenses to, any officers, directors or managers, it being the
intent of the parties hereto that the officers, directors and managers of the
Company Group on the date hereof shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement to the full extent of the law.
Any amounts paid after Closing for indemnification to any officer, director or
manager of the Company Group shall be included in the definition of Losses for
purposes of _Article 8_ to the extent of any related breach of this
Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, each such beneficiary of such indemnification
and such Persons estate, heirs and representatives, and are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have pursuant to law, the organizational
documents of any member of the Company Group, contract or otherwise. Prior to
the Closing, the Company may elect (in its sole discretion) to purchase at its
cost (which cost shall be included in the Sellers Transaction Expenses) an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys and its
Subsidiaries directors and officers that shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for such time period and on such terms as the Company
so determines. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policy in full
force and effect, and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 



 

8.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company will promptly provide or make available to Purchaser copies of
all Tax Returns that are to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall
permit Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing
it, providing Purchaser with a reasonable time for such review and comment,
and shall reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are requested by Purchaser. The Company will timely file, or cause
to be timely filed, all such Tax Returns and shall pay all Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company Group which are
filed after the Closing Date for any Taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a " **Straddle Period** "). No later than thirty (30) days
prior to filing any income Tax Return, and no later than fourteen (14) days
prior to filing any other type of Tax Return, Purchaser shall submit such Tax
Return to the Sellers Representative for its review and comment, and
Purchaser shall include all reasonable revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Sellers Representative. Exclusive of any
indemnification rights under _Article 8_, five (5) days prior to the filing
of such Tax Returns, the Sellers shall pay to Purchaser any Taxes shown as due
and owing on any such Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including on or after the Closing Date, the
Company Group) shall not file, or cause to be filed, any restatement or
amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund relating to, any Tax Return
of any member of the Company Group for any Taxable period that begins prior to
the Closing Date (regardless of whether such Taxable period ends prior to the
Closing Date) without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 8.9_, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative,
and their Affiliates, representatives, and employees, shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with (i) the filing
of Tax Returns, (ii) any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii) the preparation of any financial statements to
the extent related to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and
(upon the other partys request) the provision, of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; _provided_ , that the party requesting assistance shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such
assistance; _provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to provide
assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the
business and operations of such party. Furthermore, the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns that relate to Taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall provide the
Sellers Representative with notice of any written inquiries, audits,
examinations or proposed adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority, which relate to any such Taxable periods within ten
(10) days of the receipt of such notice; provided, however, the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the Sellers have been materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure. Within five (5) days of the Sellers Representatives receipt
of such notice the Sellers Representative shall notify the Purchaser in
writing whether it has elected to control such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding. If the Sellers Representative does not provide notice within five
(5) days as described in the proceeding sentence or if the Sellers
Representative elects not to control any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding, then Purchaser shall control such matter, provided, that (x) the
Sellers Representative shall have the right to participate in any such matter
at its sole cost and expense, (y) Purchaser shall keep the Sellers
Representative reasonably informed of the status of such matter (including
providing the Sellers Representative with copies of all written
correspondence regarding such matter), and (z) to the extent that Purchaser,
the Company Group or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, pay any amounts
out-of-pocket with respect to the defense of such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding, the Sellers shall promptly reimburse such Person for such amounts
to the extent such defense is with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Purchaser shall not settle any such proceedings without the Sellers
Representatives written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Sellers Representative elects to
control any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding then the Sellers
Representative shall reasonably consult, in good faith with Purchaser before
taking any action with respect to the conduct of such audit, litigation, or
other proceeding, shall not settle such audit, litigation, or other proceeding
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Purchaser, and counsel of
its own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully (at Purchasers
sole cost and expense) in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such
audit, litigation, or other proceeding. The provisions of this _Section 8.9_
shall govern the audit of any Tax Return for, or any other matter related to
(including a breach of representations and warranties

 



      
 

 



 

related to Taxes), any Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.
The Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall jointly control and
participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any audit, litigation,
or other proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, and shall bear their own respective costs
and expenses. Neither the Sellers Representative nor Purchaser shall settle
any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned (except as otherwise set forth herein).

 



 

(d) _Refunds_. Any refunds of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
that are received by Purchaser, the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing Date, (any such refund, a " **Pre-Closing Tax Refund** "),
shall be for the account of the Sellers (net of any Taxes thereon), and
Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers Representative for the benefit of the
Sellers any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within fifteen (15) days after receipt
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such refunds of Taxes shall be for
the account of Purchaser to the extent such refunds of Taxes are attributable
(determined on a marginal basis) to the carryback from a taxable period that
begins after the Closing Date of items of loss, deduction or credit, or other
Tax items, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective Affiliates, including Purchaser). To the extent reasonably
requested and at the Sellers sole cost and expense, Purchaser shall cooperate
with Sellers Representative in obtaining such refunds, including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims, it being understood that (i)
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company Group to not, waive any
carryback of net operating loss or other Tax attribute of any member of the
Company Group generated or otherwise attributable to a Taxable period ending
on or before or including the Closing Date if such waiver would reduce the
amount due to Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.9(d)_, (ii) Purchaser and
the Company Group will carryback any net operating losses for Taxable periods
ending on or before or including the Closing Date to prior Taxable periods as
allowable by applicable Tax law and shall claim Tax refunds as a result of
such carryback (including through the filing of amended Tax Returns), (iii)
any such refunds will be claimed in cash rather than as a credit against
future Tax liabilities, (iv) Purchaser and the Company Group shall cooperate
with the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers) in preparing
and filing Tax Returns (including amendments of prior Tax Returns and claims
for refunds, including claims for refunds on IRS Forms 1139 and/or 4466) for
any Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for any Straddle
Period no later than thirty (30) days after the end of such period, (v) a Pre-
Closing Tax Refund with respect to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall be determined in accordance with _Section
8.9(e)_ and Purchaser shall pay over to the Sellers Representative (for the
benefit of the Sellers) the actual and/or deemed Pre-Closing Tax Refund for
such period (including estimated Taxes paid prior to the Closing Date) within
ten (10) days after the filing of the Tax Return for such period, and (vii) to
the extent Pre-Closing Tax Refunds are reduced because of the inability to
close the tax year of any member of the Company Group on the Closing Date,
then Purchaser shall pay over to the Sellers Representative (for the benefit
of the Sellers) the amount of such reduction within ten (10) days of the
filing of the Tax Return for the applicable Straddle Period.

 



 

(e) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company Group, imposed
in connection

 



       
 

 



 

with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes of the Company Group for a
Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period.

 



 

(f) No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof shall make an election under
Section 338 of the Code or any similar provision of foreign, state or local
law in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) To the extent there is conflict between this _Section 8.9_ and any other
provision of this Agreement, this _Section 8.9_ will control.

 



 

(h) Any payments under this Agreement shall be treated by all parties as
adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a duly
executed and acknowledged certificate, in form and substance acceptable to
Purchaser and in compliance with the Code and Treasury Regulations, certifying
that the Company is not and has not been a United States real property holding
corporation, dated as of the Closing Date and in form and substance required
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h).

among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed
effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any

constitute, a waiver of any other provisions, whether or not similar, nor

9.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth

 



      
 

 



 

herein may be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative, any attempted assignment
without such prior written consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser (i) may collaterally assign its rights under this
Agreement in connection with any secured loan arrangement and (ii) may assign
this Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser; provided, however
that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), no such assignment shall limit or
affect the assignors obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

9.5 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and the parties intend that no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any Person. The use of the word " _including_ " in this
Agreement or in any of the agreements contemplated hereby shall be by way of
example rather than by limitation. Unless the context otherwise requires, any
reference to a " _Section,_ " " _Exhibit,_ " or " _Schedule_ " shall be deemed
to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a
schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," " _herein_ "
and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar import referring to this Agreement
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. References to documents and other information that are to be "made
available", "provided" to Purchaser or language to similar effect means that
such information referred to (i) has been actually delivered (whether by email
transmission or hand delivery) to Purchaser or its outside legal counsel, as
applicable, or (ii) was posted on the electronic data room hosted by
Intralinks, in each case at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date
hereof.

 



 

9.6 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

 



 

9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including as set forth in _Section 8.8_ above), nothing
herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon
or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees or
creditors of the Company Group; _provided_ , that the lenders set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters are express third party beneficiaries for purposes of
_Section 7.2(d)_, _Section 9.11_ and _Section 9.13._

 



 

9.8 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including pursuant to
_Sections 7.2(a)_ through _7.2(d)_ , any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and

 



      
 

 



 

the exercise by a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other such remedy. The parties understand and agree that the covenants
and undertakings on each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related
to the desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the
transaction contemplated herein, that the transactions contemplated herein
represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of the
Company and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates and further agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its terms and further agree
that, although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such
covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
therefor. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its
respective Subsidiaries, that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by the Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of its respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall, except as precluded by _Sections 7.2(a)_ through _7.2(d)_
, be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In the event that any action
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense, that
there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause Purchaser and/or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, only if (A) all conditions in _Section 3.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and those
conditions that are not satisfied solely as a result of Purchasers or Merger
Subs breach of this Agreement) have been satisfied at the time the Closing
would have been required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and remain so
satisfied or will be satisfied at the Closing, (B) Purchaser and Merger Sub
fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (C) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then
the Closing will occur. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letters, and, if entered into prior to the
Closing, the Debt Financing Documents. In the event that all conditions to the
Debt Financing have been satisfied, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other persons providing the
Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing on the Closing Date on the terms
and conditions detailed in the Debt Commitment Letters. It is mutually agreed
by each of the parties to this Agreement that nothing in this _Section
9.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require,
Purchaser or Merger Sub to file suit or commence any proceeding against the
persons providing the Debt Financing to cause such persons to fund such Debt
Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) the Company has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. To
the extent any party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such party pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of
such, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such action (it being understood that this _Section 9.8_
shall not be deemed to alter, amend, supplement or otherwise modify the terms
of any Commitment Letter (including the expiration or termination provisions
thereof)).

 



 

9.9 _Complete Agreement_. This document and the documents referred to herein
contain the complete agreement between the parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

 



 

9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which may be by facsimile, and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

9.11 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any state court sitting in
the State of Delaware or United States federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, over any suit, action or other proceeding brought by any party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to any such suit,
action or other proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. In
the event of any litigation regarding or arising from this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party
its reasonable expenses, attorneys fees and costs incurred therein or in
enforcement or collection of any judgment or award rendered therein.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 9.11(a)_ to the contrary, each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). The provisions of this _Section 9.11(b)_ shall be
enforceable by each Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTION, IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE AGAINST THE FINANCING
SOURCES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.

 



 

9.13 _No Recourse_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement, (i)
in no event may the Sellers, the Company or any other Person seek or permit to
be sought on behalf of the Sellers, the Company or any of their Affiliates or
any other Person, any damages or any other recovery or judgment of any kind,
in law or in equity, from any Purchaser Related Party in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that in no event
shall either of Purchaser or Merger Sub be considered a Purchaser Related
Party for purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, and (ii) the Company and each Seller acknowledge and agree
that they have no right of recovery against, and no personal Liability shall
attach to any such Purchaser Related Party, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Company
against Purchaser or any Purchaser Related Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) None of the Sellers or the Company shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Financing Sources, solely in their
respective capacities as such lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights
or claims against the Sellers in connection with the Debt Financing, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained herein shall restrict the ability of the Sellers and
the Company to seek specific performance of Purchasers obligations hereunder
in connection with the Debt Financing pursuant to and in accordance with, and
subject to the limitations set forth in, _Section 9.8(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 9.13_ are intended to be for the benefit
of the Purchaser, the Financing Sources and the other Purchaser Related
Parties, and all such Purchaser Related Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries hereof.
