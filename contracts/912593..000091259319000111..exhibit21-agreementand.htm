Shareholder (including Dissenting Shareholders) of record for such holder to
use in surrendering the certificates that represented his, her or its Target
Shares in exchange for a pro rata portion of the Closing Aggregate Merger

Target Shareholder together with its executed Transmittal Letter in order to
receive his, her or its pro rata share of the Closing Aggregate Merger
Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall upon written



request provide copies of each Transmittal Letter so received to the
Shareholder Representative.

(ii) Until so surrendered (with such Transmittal Letter), each Target Share
(other than those described in Section 2(h)(ii)) shall represent solely the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration hereunder, into which such

such Target Shareholder as provided herein, any certificates for Target Shares

distribution on Parent Shares to any record holder of outstanding Target
Shares until the holder so surrenders for exchange his, her or its
certificates that represented Target Shares, provided, however that such
dividend or distribution shall be paid over to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the applicable Target Shareholders for distribution upon exchange
as provided herein. In the event that any Target Shares are not so
surrendered, the holder of such outstanding Target Shares will not be entitled
to any interest or earnings on the dividend or distribution with respect
thereto (or any dividend or distribution made in connection therewith).

(iv) Parent may cause the Exchange Agent to return to Parent any such Parent
Shares, and any dividends and distributions thereon, remaining unclaimed one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the Effective Time. Upon receipt, Parent
shall hold such remaining Parent Shares for the benefit of the applicable
Target Shareholders; provided, however, that Parent shall not be liable to any
Target Shareholder in respect of any such Parent Shares delivered to a public
official as required by and pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Target Share certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such
fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and the providing of an indemnity by such Person, substantially in form
attached hereto as Exhibit 2(e)(v),against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Target Share certificate, the Per
Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Target Share
represented by such certificate, in the amounts, at the times, and in the
manner contemplated by this Section 2(e).

(vi) Parent shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

(vii) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent (without duplication)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Per Share Merger
Consideration, otherwise payable to any holder of Target Shares pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law; provided,
however, prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the applicable
withholding agent shall provide notice to the affected recipient of the
amounts subject to withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such recipient
to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from
withholding tax. To the extent that amounts are so required under applicable
Tax Law to be deducted or withheld from the



payment of Per Share Merger Consideration to a Target Shareholder, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent (and any other Person that has a
withholding obligation pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication) is
hereby authorized to sell whole shares of Parent Shares comprising such
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Target
Shareholder as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to this Agreement), as the case may be, to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement, and Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding
obligation pursuant to this Agreement) shall notify such holder of such sale
and (x) remit the applicable portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the
appropriate taxing authority and (y) remit the remaining net proceeds of such
sale (after deduction for the amounts described in clause (x)) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Amounts so withheld and timely and properly
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Target Shares
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(f) Closing of Transfer Records. After the close of business on the Closing
Date, transfers of Target Shares outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall
not be made on the stock transfer books of Surviving Entity.

(g) Allocation of Purchase Price. For purposes of determining the amount of
the New Hampshire Indemnity Escrow Fund, amounts payable with respect to
controlling interest transfer taxes and Title Policy amounts, the Parties
agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated (i) among the Communities
comprising the Property, and (ii) between the Improved Land and the Expansion
Land, in each case, as set forth on the attached Exhibit 2(g).

(h) Appraisal Rights.

(i) Any Target Shareholder who wishes to exercise its dissenter's or appraisal
rights under the Dissenter's Rights Statute shall initiate such exercise by
(A) prior to the Target Shareholder vote on the Merger, giving written notice
to the Target in accordance with the Dissenter's Rights Statute of such Target
Shareholder's intent to assert dissenter's or appraisal rights under the
Dissenter's Rights Statute if the Merger is consummated; and (B) not voting or
permitting to be voted such Target Shareholder's Target Shares in favor of or
approving the Merger (each Target Shareholder who so initiates the exercise of
such rights, being a "Dissenting Shareholder").

(ii) The Target Shares held by any Dissenting Shareholder, at and as of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2(d)(iv)(A); provided, however,
that such Target Shares shall only represent the right to receive a cash
payment in the amount of the Fair Value of such Target Shares, plus interest,
as provided by the Dissenter's Rights Statute, if, and only if:

(A) after the Closing, such Dissenting Shareholder takes all necessary actions
required under the Dissenter's Rights Statute to properly perfect the exercise
of its dissenter's or appraisal rights under the Dissenter's Rights Statute,
including without limitation, properly completing the form as required by the
Dissenter's Rights Statute sent by the Surviving Entity with the Appraisal
Notice,



and timely delivering such form as directed in the Appraisal Notice to the
Surviving Entity together with the certificates representing such Dissenting
Shareholder's Target Shares by the Return Date (as defined in Section 5(g))
set forth in the Appraisal Notice; and

(B) such Dissenting Shareholder has not withdrawn the exercise of such rights
by written notice to the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent on or before
the Return Date.

(iii) The provisions of Section 2(h)(ii) notwithstanding, the Target Shares
held by any Dissenting Shareholder shall in no event represent the right to
receive a cash payment in the amount of the Fair Value of such Target Shares,
plus interest, as provided by the Dissenter's Rights Statute and shall
continue to represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
if:

(A) as of the Return Date, such Dissenting Shareholder fails to take all
actions described in clause (A) of Section 2(h)(ii) or;

(B) on or before the Return Date, the Dissenting Shareholder has withdrawn the
exercise of such rights as described in clause (B) of Section 2(h)(ii).



(iv) The Target Shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder that pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2(h)(ii) represent the right to receive a cash payment
in the amount of the Fair Value of thereof, plus interest, as provided by the
Dissenter's Rights Statute are referred to herein as such Dissenting
Shareholder's "Dissenter's Shares".

(v) In the event that the Requisite Target Vote approving the Merger is
obtained, then:

(A) prior to the Closing, Target shall comply in all respects with all
applicable provisions of the Dissenter's Rights Statute;

(B) at the Closing, for avoidance of doubt, Parent shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration for all Target
Shares held by the Dissenting Shareholders;

(C) following the Closing, Surviving Entity shall comply in all respects with
all applicable provisions of the Dissenter's Rights Statute, including, if
applicable, sending to each Dissenting Shareholder the Appraisal Notice and
required form pursuant to the Dissenter's Rights Statute and, if applicable,
cash payment of the Fair Value of the Dissenting Shareholder's Dissenter's
Shares plus interest; and

(D) As promptly as reasonably practical, but in no event later than the third
Business Day following the Return Date, the Surviving Entity shall provide to
the Exchange Agent, Escrow Agent and Shareholder Representative a listing of
Dissenting Shareholders whose Target Shares have been converted to the right
to receive a cash payment in the amount of the Fair Value of such shares, plus
interest,



as provided by the Dissenter's Rights Statute, pursuant to Section 2(h)(ii)
and the number of Dissenter's Shares so held by each such Dissenting
Shareholder (the "Perfected Dissenting Shareholder Listing" and each such
Dissenting Shareholder on such list being a "Perfected Dissenting
Shareholder") or, if none, a written statement that as of and at the Return
Date, there are no Dissenting Shareholders whose Target Shares have been
converted to such right (the "No Perfected Dissenting Shareholder Statement")
and shall direct the Exchange Agent to return (and the Exchange Agent shall so
return) to the Parent the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration received
from the Parent with respect to any such Dissenter's Shares.



(E) Surviving Entity shall not permit or consent to the withdrawal by a
Perfected Dissenting Shareholder of its appraisal rights under the Dissenting
Right's Statute following the Return Date.



(vi) Target shall bear any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent,
Surviving Entity, or Target in connection with complying with the Dissenter's
Rights Statute, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses to
the extent assessed against the Surviving Entity, and also including any
amounts by which the Fair Value of a Perfected Dissenting Shareholder's
Dissenter's Shares, as determined, settled or otherwise agreed to, consistent
with the Dissenter's Rights Statute and paid to such Perfected Dissenting
Shareholders exceeds the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration which would
have been paid to such Perfected Dissenting Shareholders for their Target
Shares had such Perfected Dissenting Shareholders not exercised their rights
under the Dissenter's Rights Statute, which fees, costs, expenses and amounts,
if not otherwise paid by Target prior to the Closing, shall be payable solely
from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to the extent thereof in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement (and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse
against the Target Indemnifying Parties beyond the Indemnification Escrow Fund
for any such liability). The provisions of the foregoing sentence
notwithstanding, in the event that aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
which would have been paid to such Perfected Dissenting Shareholders in
respect of their Target Shares had they not exercised their rights under the
Dissenter's Rights Statute exceeds the aggregate Fair Value of such Perfected
Dissenting Shareholders' Dissenter's Shares paid to such Perfected Dissenting
Shareholders, Parent shall within five (5) Business Days of the last payment
of such Fair Value, pay the amount of such excess to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the Distribution Shareholders in accordance with their
Distribution Percentage.





(i) Distribution of the Post-Closing Escrow Amount and Pre-Closing Escrow
Amount. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no portion of any
Post Closing Escrow Amount shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent until the
fifth (5th) day following the Pre-Closing Dividend Distribution Date. On the
fifth (5th) day following the Pre-Closing Dividend Distribution Date, the
Escrow Agent shall, after funding the Post-Closing Escrow Accounts from the
Pre-Closing Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 2(c)(iv), disburse the
balance of the Pre-Closing Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as follows:



(A) If either the Target shall have delivered to Escrow Agent a No Dissenting
Shareholder Statement as provided in Section 2(c)(x) or the Surviving Entity
shall have delivered a No Perfected Dissenting Shareholder Statement as
provided in Section 2(h)(vi)(D), then the Escrow Agent shall so disburse the
balance of the Pre-Closing Escrow Amount, together with any interest or other
amounts earned thereon, to an account designated in writing by the Shareholder
Representative in the Escrow Agreement. Promptly upon receipt thereof,
Shareholder Representative shall disburse and cause to be delivered to each of
the Distribution Shareholders by check or by wire transfer such Distribution
Shareholder's amount thereof in accordance with his, her, or its Distribution
Percentage.

(B) If the Surviving Entity shall have delivered a Perfected Dissenting
Shareholder Listing to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 2(h)(vi), the
Escrow Agent shall so disburse the balance of the Pre-Closing Escrow Amount as
follows:

(i) to each such Perfected Dissenting Shareholder on the Perfected Dissenting
Shareholder Listing, an amount (less any required tax withholding) equal to
the Pre-Closing Dividend Amount times a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of Target Shares owned by such Perfected Dissenting Shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the denominator of which was the
total number of Target Shares held by all Target Shareholders immediately
prior to the Effective Time, together with any interest or other amounts
earned thereon, via check in accordance with the information provided in the
Perfected Dissenting Shareholder Listing; and

(ii) the balance of the Pre-Closing Escrow Amount remaining after the
distribution described in Section 2(i)(B)(ii), together with any interest or
other amounts earned thereon, to an account designated in writing by the
Shareholder Representative in the Escrow Agreement. Promptly following receipt
thereof Shareholder Representative shall cause to be delivered to each of the
Distribution Shareholders by check or wire transfer such Distribution
Shareholder's amount thereof in accordance with his, her, or its Distribution
Percentage.

(j) Deposit. Within two (2) Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement by the Parties, Merger Sub shall deliver the Deposit to the Title
Company. The Merger Sub shall cause the Title Company, promptly upon receipt
of the Deposit, to provide written notice to the Target of the Title Company's
receipt of the Deposit. The Title Company shall invest the Deposit in an
interest bearing savings or money market account, as directed by Merger Sub.
If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement closes in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing the Deposit plus interest
shall be returned to Merger Sub and there shall be no credit applied toward
the Purchase Price. In the event the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement fails to close, the distribution of the Deposit plus interest shall
be governed by Section 11.

to the extent applicable.

(i) Taxes and Tax Treatment.

(i) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all material Tax
returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any valid extension
to file). Each such Tax return is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Parent and each such Subsidiary



has paid (or Parent has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes required to be
paid. All material Taxes which Parent or its Subsidiaries are required by Law
to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent
required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities within the
time period prescribed by Law. The most recent audited financial statements
contained in the SEC Documents filed with the prior to the date of this
Agreement reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all material
Taxes payable by Parent and any of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Parent and
each such Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall
continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are
adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since
December 31, 2018, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and
other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of
property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any material
audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or
foreign Taxes; to the Knowledge of Parent, no material audit, examination or
other proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is being considered by any Tax
authority; and no material audit, examination or proceeding in respect of
federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has occurred since December 31, 2018. No deficiencies for any
Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of
Parent, proposed) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including claims
by any Taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be
subject to Taxation, which individually or in the aggregate would be material,
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been
granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are no liens, claims and
encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
except for statutory liens, claims or encumbrances for Taxes not yet due or
payable and for which appropriate reserves have been established on their
respective financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

(ii) Parent (A) has been subject to taxation as a "real estate investment
trust: ("REIT") within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the
requirements for qualification as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ended
December 31, 1994, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to operate, in a
manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT through the Effective Time and the Drop Down and (C) has not taken or
omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to result in the
failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT. Each Subsidiary of Parent
which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company (that has
not joined with Parent in making an election to be a taxable REIT subsidiary
in accordance with Section 856(1) of the Code) since its formation has (A)
been and continues to be classified for federal income Tax purposes as a
partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an association
taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not owned any assets
(including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Parent to violate
Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. No Subsidiary of Parent since its formation has
been or is now a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes
other than a corporation that qualifies as a qualified REIT subsidiary or a
taxable REIT subsidiary. Since its inception, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have not incurred (i) any



material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been
previously paid; and (ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5)
(for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or
856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification requirements applicable to
REITs). Each corporation, trust or other entity taxable as an association
which has merged with and into Parent either (1) had been subject to taxation
as a REIT at all times since its initial election of REIT status and had
satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, except to the
extent that a failure to satisfy such requirements would not have a material
adverse effect on Parent, or (2) has become a disregarded entity of Parent.
Parent's dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the
Code, for each taxable year, taking into account any dividends subject to
Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (x)
Parent's REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code,
determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year and
(y) Parent' s net capital gain for such year.

(iii) Neither Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries nor, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any of its Affiliates, has taken or agreed to take any
action or Knows of any fact that could be reasonably expected to prevent or
impede the Merger, together with the Drop Down, from qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment or from constituting a "reorganization" qualifying
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(j) Financial Capacity. Parent has, and at the Closing Date will have,
sufficient financial capacity, cash or lines of credit available to pay (i)
the Closing Cash Merger Consideration, and (ii) any and all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any related fees and expenses. At the
Closing Date, Merger Sub and Parent will have sufficient financial capacity
for Merger Sub to assume, by operation of the Merger, the Pre-Closing Dividend
Financing and satisfy its obligations with respect thereto.

(k) New Jersey Properties. As of the Closing Date, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub intends to change the use of any Property located in the State of New
Jersey to any use other than as a "private residential leasehold community,"
as such term is defined in the New Jersey Statute.

(l) New York Properties. As of the Closing Date, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
intends to change the use of any Property located in the State of New York
after the Closing to any use other than for the purpose of manufactured home
lot rentals, within the meaning of the New York Statute.

(m) Proceedings. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has received any notice of any
existing, pending or threatened Proceedings, and there are no existing,
pending or threatened Proceedings Known to Parent, involving Parent, Merger
Sub or SCOLP or any of their properties that could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the performance by Sun or Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Drop Down.

(n) RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW Insurance Policy has been bound as of the
date hereof and such policy has a policy limit and exclusions acceptable to
Parent and Merger Sub and is acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub in all
respects. Parent and Merger Sub Know of no reason why the coverage under the
RandW Insurance Policy will not be in effect at the Closing or why the RandW
Insurance Policy will not be issued after the Closing. A true, complete and
correct copy of the binder for the RandW Insurance Policy, and to which is
attached the form of RandW Insurance Policy, is attached hereto as Exhibit J.



(o) HSR Act. For purposes of determining Parent's compliance with the HSR Act,
Parent's Board of Directors has determined that the fair market value of
Target's assets other than Exempt Assets (as defined below) is less than $90
million. For purposes hereof, (i) "Exempt Assets" are Investment Rental
Property assets held solely for rental or investment purposes and not rented
to entities included within the acquiring person except for the sole purpose
of maintaining, managing or supervising the operation of the real property,
and (ii) "Investment Rental Property" includes (1) property currently rented,

the Surviving Entity shall pay all accrued paid time off with respect to such
employees as of Closing Date in the next payroll cycle post-Closing from the
Target's Account and through the Target's payroll system.

each case related to obligations incurred by Target at or prior to the
Closing), such items



shall be paid by Target. Solely for purposes of providing credits pursuant to
this Agreement, Continuing Employees and Transitional Employees shall be
accounted for as employees of Target and any Target Subsidiary through 11:59
P.M. on the day prior to the Closing Date and shall be accounted for as
employees of Parent or the Merger Sub, as applicable, as of the Closing Date,
but, for avoidance of doubt, for all other purposes, the employment by Target
and any Target Subsidiary of such employees shall not terminate prior to or as
a result of the Merger and will continue through and following the Effective
Time.

Section 5(i), the attached Exhibit 5(i) memorializes certain undertakings
among Target, on the one hand, and Merger Sub and Parent on the other hand
with respect to the matters set forth therein all of which are subject to the
provisions of applicable Law, and incorporated herein by reference as if fully
set forth herein.

(xi) Neither Target, any Target Subsidiary, nor any Target Indemnifying Party
shall have any liability, and Parent and Merger Sub agree that they and the
Surviving Entity shall have sole liability with respect to (and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Target Indemnified Parties as provided
in Section 12(c)(iii) with respect to the following matters (the "Employee
Termination Matters"): (a) Parent's on-boarding process or other action taken
or to be taken by Parent, Surviving Entity or their Affiliates described in
Exhibit 5(i); (b) any decision, action or inaction, by Parent, Merger Sub or
their Affiliates which result in not providing Post-Closing Employment to any
of the Terminated Employees or Continuing Employees or in not providing Post-
Closing Employment to Transitional Employees as anticipated by this Agreement,
in each case arising solely with respect to claims for violations of state or
federal discrimination laws; or (c) any violation of the WARN Act as a result
of any termination of the Terminated Employees or the discontinuation of the
Post-Closing Employment of any Continuing Employee or Transitional Employee.

(j) Termination of Affiliate Agreements. Target shall cause any contract or
arrangement that is disclosed (or should have been disclosed) on Section 3(dd)
of the Disclosure Schedule to be terminated effective as of no later than the
Closing Date without any ongoing liability on the part of Target except as set
forth on such Section of the Disclosure Schedule.

(k) RandW Insurance Policy. Prior to or on the Closing, Parent: (i) shall pay or
cause to be paid, all costs and expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy,
including the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commissions and
other fees and expenses of such policy and (ii) take all reasonable steps and
deliver all declarations and other documents as may be required by the insurer
under the RandW Insurance Policy in order to cause the RandW Insurance Policy to
be in effect at the Closing and for the RandW Insurance Policy to be issued
following the Closing.

(l) Updates to Disclosure Schedule. From time to time prior to the Closing
Date, Target shall deliver to Merger Sub one or more written supplements to
the Disclosure Schedule disclosing any matter arising after the date hereof
which, if not disclosed, would cause the applicable representation or warranty
in Section 3 to no longer be true and correct in all material respects (each a
"Schedule Supplement"). Unless consented to in writing by Merger Sub, or
otherwise as a result of any action expressly permitted by this Agreement, the
disclosure of such matter in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed
to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification or
termination rights contained in this Agreement, or of determining whether or
not the conditions set forth in Section 6 have been satisfied. If the matters
set forth



on any Schedule Supplement would, if not consented to in writing by Merger
Sub, result in a material breach of any representation or warranty of Target
under Section 3, Merger Sub may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
Target. If Parent or Merger Sub has the right to, but does not elect to,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5(l) within three (3)
Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement or if Parent and
Merger Sub proceed with the Closing, then Parent and Merger Sub shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with
respect to such matter and, further, shall have irrevocably waived its right
to indemnification under Section 12 with respect to such matter. If either
Parent or Merger Sub elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5(l), the disclosure in the Schedule Supplement which resulted in the
election to terminate shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation contained in Section 3 for purposes of
determining Parent and Merger Sub's rights under Section 11(a) of this
Agreement.

(m) Environmental Matters.

(i) Target shall maintain all material Environmental Permits which have been
obtained and are in existence and necessary for the ownership, lease,
operation or use of the business or assets of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, through the Closing Date in accordance with
Environmental Law.

Target and the Shareholder Representative agree to the provisions set forth on
the attached Exhibit P.

(n) Access. From the date hereof until the Closing, Target shall (i) afford
Parent and its representatives full and free access to and the right to
inspect all of the Property, including, but not limited to, the right to
conduct environmental, soil, engineering and other tests (provided that Parent
has entered into an access agreement with Target, and if applicable, the
Target Subsidiary owning such Property, in form and substance satisfactory to
Target, in each case, with respect to each Community at which such tests will
be performed), and to inspect the mechanical, plumbing and utility systems
located at the Property together with all other aspects of the Property, and
the books and records, and other documents and data related to Target and the
Target Subsidiaries; (ii) furnish Parent and its representatives with such
financial, operating and other data and information related to Target and the
Target Subsidiaries as Parent or any of its representatives may reasonably
request; and (iii) instruct the representatives of Target to cooperate with
Parent in its investigation of Target and the Property. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 5(n) shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Target.

(o) Bulk Sales Laws and Tax Clearance Certificates.

(i) Target and the Target Subsidiaries shall provide such cooperation as
Merger Sub may reasonably request to allow Merger Sub to comply with any
applicable bulk sales laws in connection with the Merger so as to minimize to
the extent possible Merger Sub's liability for transfer Taxes as a result of
the application of such bulk sales laws. Without limiting the foregoing,
Target and the Target Subsidiaries shall in a timely manner deliver such
notices and make such applications as Merger Sub may request in writing as may
be necessary to allow such compliance.

(ii) At or before Closing, Target shall have delivered to Merger Sub the tax
status certificates or equivalent documents identified on the attached Exhibit
5(o) (the "Tax Clearance Certificates") with respect to applicable sales, use,
bulk, unemployment and other



taxes payable by Target and the Target Subsidiaries and/or otherwise in
connection with the Property attributable to the period prior to the Closing
Date.

(p) Pre-Closing Dividend and Pre-Closing Dividend Financing.

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5(p), prior to the
Closing, Target shall declare the Pre-Closing Dividend subject to the

Closing Escrow Account as provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

(ii) Any Pre-Closing Dividend Financing shall be obtained by Target solely as
described in this Section 5(p).

(iii) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Target has obtained from a third
party lender, other than Parent or its Affiliates (a "Third Party Lender") a
binding commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") to provide a term loan
facility to Target in an amount sufficient for Target to pay the Pre-Closing
Dividend to the Target Shareholders.

(iv) The Pre-Closing Dividend Financing shall be on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter and the Parties shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts (including executing all documents and taking all actions referenced
in the Commitment Letter) to close the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing.

(v) The proceeds of the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing in the amount of the
Pre-Closing Dividend Amount (such amount, less any required tax withholding,
the "Pre-Closing Dividend Financing Proceeds") shall be disbursed to the
Escrow Agent to be held in, and disbursed from, the Pre-Closing Escrow Account
as provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5(p), if, for
any reason, (x) the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing is not obtained prior to
the Closing; or (y) the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing Proceeds are not
disbursed to the Escrow Agent prior to Closing for application as provided in
the immediately preceding clause (iv), then, in each case, Parent agrees that,
immediately prior to the Closing, Parent, at its sole cost and expense, will
cause (A) the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing to be provided to Target by a
replacement Third Party Lender substantially on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter or such other terms as are acceptable to Target, Merger Sub
and the replacement Third Party Lender, and (B) the full Pre-Closing Dividend
Amount to be advanced, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the
Escrow Agent to be held in, and disbursed from, the Pre-Closing Escrow Account
as provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in
performing any obligation under this clause (vi), Parent shall not be deemed
to be a Financing Source.

(vii) If for any reason, the Closing does not occur or this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, (a) Target shall issue instructions to the Escrow
Agent to disburse, and the Escrow Agent shall so disburse, the full Pre-
Closing Escrow Amount to the Third Party Lender providing the Pre-Closing
Dividend Financing in full repayment of the Pre-Closing Dividend Financing;
and (b) neither the Target nor the Shareholder Representative shall



thereafter have any further obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to
the Pre-Closing Dividend, the Pre-Closing Dividend Amount or the Pre-Closing
Dividend Financing.

(q) Termination of Project Contracts. On or prior to the Closing Date, Target
and each Target Subsidiary, as applicable, shall terminate each of the Project
Contracts specified under the heading "Contracts to be Terminated at Closing"
on the attached Exhibit 5(q) (the "Excluded Contracts").

(i) Target and Merger Sub acknowledge that, as of the date of this Agreement,
Target is undertaking the capital improvement projects (collectively, the

Target has budgeted as of the date of this Agreement for the completion of the
Capital Improvement Projects identified on the CapEx Exhibit.

(ii) Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Capital
Improvement Projects on the CapEx Exhibit to be completed before the Closing
Date in accordance with the plans therefor and in accordance with its past
practices for capital improvement projects generally.

(iii) Until the Closing, Target shall keep Merger Sub reasonably informed
regarding the progress of the Capital Improvement Projects. Merger Sub and its
contractors, engineers and consultants shall have the right to visit
Communities periodically during the course of the Capital Improvement Project
to inspect and evaluate same, and Target or its agents shall participate in
and cooperate with such inspections and shall promptly respond to and address
any questions or material concerns raised by Merger Sub or its contractors,
engineers or consultants.

(iv) With respect to each Capital Improvement Project that has not been
completed prior to the Closing: (a) at the Closing, Target shall provide to
Parent a written statement showing the total amount of the costs and expenses
paid since the date of this Agreement in completing such Capital Improvement
Project, together with receipts or other reasonable evidence of payment
therefor reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The amount by which the aggregate
amount budgeted for all such Capital Improvement Project as shown on the CapEx
Exhibit exceeds the aggregate amount of such costs and expenses paid since the
date of this Agreement in completing the Capital Improvement Projects is
referred to as the "CapEx Project Credit." The CapEx Project Credit shall be a
credit in favor of Merger Sub in accordance with Section 9(a)(i)(I).

(s) Tenant Rights Statutes and New Hampshire Statute.

(i) Following the date of this Agreement and through the Closing Date, Target
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all material
respects with the requirements of all applicable Tenant Rights Statutes (other
than the New Hampshire Statute which, for avoidance of doubt, is addressed in
clause (ii) immediately below). In determining such requirements, Target shall
be entitled to rely on the truth and accuracy of the Parent and Merger Sub's
representations set forth in Sections 4(k) and 4(l).



(ii) With respect to the New Hampshire Statute, Target's sole obligations and
undertakings under this Agreement shall be as follows with respect to each New
Hampshire Community:

(A) send the applicable New Hampshire Notice to each applicable New Hampshire
Recipient within five (5) Business Days following the date upon which this

(B) promptly upon receipt thereof, to provide Merger Sub with a copy of any
written New Hampshire Offer which it receives prior to the Closing;

(C) deliver any applicable New Hampshire Affidavits as described in Section
6(b)(v); and

(D) provide the indemnity set forth in Section 12(b)(v) below.

provided, however, for avoidance of doubt (X) Target's compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5(s)(ii) shall not be deemed to be an admission by
Target that the New Hampshire Statute applies to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(t) DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

(i) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all provisions as to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by Target or any Target Subsidiary now
existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to

director, member, manager, employee or agent of Target or a Target Subsidiary
(each a "DandO Indemnified Party") as provided in the Charter Documents of
Target and the Target Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall be assumed by and be obligations of the Merger Sub,
without further action, at the Effective Time (whether or not the Charter
Documents of the Surviving Entity provide for different or no such provisions
for rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of any
DandO Indemnified Party) and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years
following the Closing Date. For six years after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Merger Sub shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party, and provide for the
advancement of expenses and exculpation to such DandO Indemnified Parties,
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), fines and settlements in connection
with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action by or omission of such DandO
Indemnified Party occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (each a "DandO
Claim") whether asserted or commenced prior to, on or after the Closing Date
to the fullest extent required or permitted by the Indemnification Provisions.

(ii) Prior to the Closing, Target shall obtain and fully pay for a "tail"
insurance policy with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time with at least the



same coverage and amount and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries as Target's existing policies with respect to claims arising out
of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(the "DandO Tail Policy"). Target shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail Policy,
and such costs, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be included
in the determination of Transaction Expenses. During the term of the DandO Tail
Policy, Merger Sub shall not take any action following the Closing to cause
the DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or
waived; provided that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any premiums or other amounts in respect
of such DandO Tail Policy.

(iii) In the event Merger Sub or any of its successors or assigns (A)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any

the successors and assigns of Merger Sub shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 5(t).

use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the
Shareholder Representative the Transitional Employees (and their replacements
or other employees assuming their responsibilities, if any) (the "Services
Employees") on an as needed basis in person and via telephone, teleconference,
email or facsimile communication during normal business hours (8:00 A.M.
through 5:00 P.M.) on Business Days, unless otherwise agreed by Parent or
Merger Sub, to provide assistance to the Shareholder Representative in
connection with the following:

(A) the Shareholder Representative's activities described in Section 9(a)(ii),

9(a)(i), the preparation of any notice to, or the response to any notice from,
Parent or Merger Sub as to any Discrepancy, the negotiation, arbitration and
resolution of any Discrepancy, and the determination of the amount of any
Merger Sub Credit or Target Credit;

(B) any actions to be taken by Shareholder Representative pursuant to Section
9(e);

(C) the Shareholder Representative's activities described in Section 10,

the Escrow Agent or the Target Shareholders, as may be deliverable by the
Shareholder Representative during the Services Term.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to
make available to Shareholder Representative the services of any Services
Employee to the extent that doing so would materially interfere with such
Services Employee's primary employment responsibilities to Parent, Merger Sub
or their Affiliates.

(ii) In making the Services Employees so available, the Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide to Shareholder Representative and such Services Employees access
to such books, records and other documents of the Target and Merger Sub and
other personnel of the Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by
Shareholder Representative or such Services Employees, solely for the purposes
of Shareholder Representative's activities described in this Section 5(u).

(iii) Except as otherwise provided for herein, each of the Parties will bear
its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the provisions of this Section 5(u). Parent and Merger Sub
shall be solely responsible for any insurance with respect to, for any
compensation and benefits to, and for any related employment Taxes with
respect to, any of the Services Employees. If Services Employees provide any
services to Shareholder Representative contemplated by this Section 5(u) after
the Services Term, Shareholder Representative shall reimburse Parent and
Merger Sub upon provision of evidence of payment therefor, for (X) the salary
or wages of the Services Employees (at their then current hourly rate) for the
time spent by such Services Employees in rendering services to the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Section 5(u); and (Y) any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates in making
the Services Employees available as provided in this Section 5(u).
Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5(u), the Services Employees are
employees of Parent, Merger Sub or another Affiliate of Parent and not
employees of Shareholder Representative; provided that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or their Affiliates shall be liable or responsible to Shareholder
Representative, any Target Shareholder or any other party with respect to any
services provided by any Services Employees to Shareholder Representative.

(iv) The relationship of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, under this Section 5(u) is and
shall be that of an independent contractor. The Services Employees shall be
required to devote only so much time, energy and skill in rendering assistance
to the Shareholder Representative as provided in this Section 5(u) as may be
necessary to complete the rendering of such assistance in a timely and
competent manner. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be considered, under the
provisions of this Section 5(u) or otherwise, to be a partner or joint
venturer of Shareholder Representative. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, on the
one hand, nor Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, shall exercise
any control over the activities and operations of the other with respect to
the matters contemplated by this Section 5(u).

the result of, the breach of the terms of this Agreement by Parent or Merger
Sub, and Target may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7(a)(iv) if the failure to close by such date shall have been caused by, or is

been satisfied as of the Outside Closing Date and Target delivers written
notice to Parent of its intention to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the Outside Closing Date, and (B) Target may not terminate

survive termination); provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any Party from liability for any breach by such Party of its covenants
under this Agreement.



Section 8. Title, Survey and Zoning Review.

(a) Title, Survey and Zoning Review.

(i) Merger Sub shall order with respect to the Property, a title insurance
commitment from the Title Company for each parcel of real property included in
the Property (collectively, the "Title Commitment"), along with legible copies
of all instruments described in the Title Commitment ("Title Documents"), to
issue the Title Policy without the "standard exceptions" and containing such
additional endorsements as Merger Sub shall reasonably request, proposing to
insure Target in the aggregate amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later
than the date occurring ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement.

(ii) Merger Sub shall obtain, no later than the Diligence Expiration Date, a
new survey or revise, modify or re-certify an existing survey for each parcel
of real property included in the Property (collectively, the "Survey") as
necessary for the Title Company to delete the survey exception from the Title
Policy, or to otherwise satisfy Merger Sub's objectives, unless Merger Sub
accepts a standard survey exception in the Title Policy.

(iii) Merger Sub shall promptly deliver the Survey to its zoning consultant
and Merger Sub shall obtain no later than five (5) days after delivery of the
Survey to its zoning consultant, a zoning report for each parcel of real
property included in the Property (collectively, a "Zoning Report") as
necessary to satisfy Merger Sub's objectives.

(iv) Target shall cure all liens, judgments and other prior financing matters
created by, under or through Target as shown on the Title Commitment or of
record, and such liens, judgments and other prior financing matters Target
shall cause to be released at or prior to Closing (with Target having the
right to apply the Adjusted Purchase Price, or a portion thereof, for such
purpose) (the "Removable Liens"), and Target shall deliver the Property free
and clear of any such Removable Liens, other than current year Taxes. Target
further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to title which are
voluntarily created by, under or through Target after the date of this
Agreement without Merger Sub's consent.

(v) If the Title Commitment, the Survey (or any revision or update of either
of them) or the Zoning Report discloses exceptions not acceptable to Merger
Sub or zoning violations, Merger Sub shall so notify Target and shall state
whether it considers any such unacceptable exception or zoning violation to be
a Material Defect on or prior to the following dates: (A) with respect to
Merger Sub's initial review of the Title Commitment, Title Documents, Survey
and Zoning Report, the date occurring ten (10) Business Days after Merger
Sub's receipt of the Title Commitment, Title Documents, the Survey for each
parcel of Land but in any event not later than the Diligence Expiration Date;
and (B) with respect to any unacceptable exception resulting from a document
recorded after the date of the applicable Title Commitment delivered as
provided above which unacceptable exception is identified in any updates to
the Title Commitment, Title Documents or Survey obtained by Merger Sub after
its initial review and objections, the date occurring five (5) Business Days
after Merger Sub's receipt of such updated Title Commitment, Title Documents
or Survey. Target shall have until 5:00 p.m. (eastern standard time) on the
date occurring ten (10) Business Days after Merger Sub's applicable
notification (the "Target's Title/Zoning Cure Deadline") to have each such
unacceptable exception to title removed, or to correct each



such other matter or zoning violation, or undertake in writing to do the
foregoing, and shall provide written notice to Merger Sub thereof. If by the
Target's Title/Zoning Cure Deadline Target fails to, declines to undertake in
writing to, or determines not to have each such unacceptable exception
removed, or to correct each such other matter or zoning violation as
aforesaid, and such unacceptable exceptions or zoning violations are not
Material Defects as set forth in Section 8(a)(vi) below, Merger Sub shall
accept title to the Property as it then is with no adjustment to the Adjusted
Purchase Price.

(vi) Material Defects.

(A) Merger Sub will provide written notice to Target of all Material Defects
based on Merger Sub's review of the Title Commitment, Survey and zoning
reports on or before (i) the Diligence Expiration Date with respect to Merger
Sub's initial review of the Title Commitment, Title Documents and Survey and
(ii) with respect to any updates to the Title Commitment, Title Documents or
Survey obtained by Merger Sub after the Diligence Expiration Date, the date
occurring five (5) Business Days after Merger Sub's receipt of such updated
Title Commitment, Title Documents or Survey. Within ten (10) Business Days
following Merger Sub's delivery of notice of Material Defects, Target and
Merger Sub shall confer and negotiate in good faith on a mutually-acceptable
resolution of the Material Defects, including the agreed-upon cost to cure
each of the Material Defects, and the amount of the Impacts of each of such
Material Defects, which will be a credit against the Adjusted Purchase Price
in favor of Merger Sub if the applicable Material Defects cannot be cured
(such ten (10) Business Day period is referred to herein as the "Mutual
Resolution Period"). If, upon the expiration of the Mutual Resolution Period,
either (A) the Parties cannot agree on an appropriate resolution of any
Material Defect, (B) Target disputes the validity of any Material Defect, or
(C) the Parties cannot agree on the cost to cure or the Impacts amount of any
applicable Material Defect, then the Parties shall submit such dispute to
binding arbitration (with a notice that shall include the applicable Material
Defect in dispute and each Party's determination of the associated Impacts) by
such third-party arbitrator mutually acceptable to the Parties (the
"Arbitrator"). The Arbitrator will decide if each such Material Defect in
dispute is valid, and if it is valid, the cost to cure such Material Defect
and the Impacts amount of such Material Defect. The decision of the Arbitrator
shall be delivered within ten (10) Business Days of the submission of the
dispute and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.



(B) If the aggregate amount of the Impacts for all of the Material Defects
does not exceed the Cure Maximum, as agreed upon by the parties pursuant to
Section 8(a)(vi)(A) above (whether through the Mutual Resolution Period or
arbitration), Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure all
Material Defects prior to Closing, up to the Cure Maximum. If Target uses its
commercially reasonable efforts to cure all Material Defects up to the Cure
Maximum, but is unable to do so by the Closing Date, the Parties will close
subject to the remaining Material Defects with a reduction of the Adjusted
Purchase Price in an amount equal to the total Impacts amount of such uncured
Material Defects, such reduction not to exceed the Cure Maximum minus the
amount of the total Impacts of the cured Material Defects paid by Target prior
to the Closing.





(C) If the aggregate amount of the Impacts for all of the Material Defects
exceeds the Cure Maximum, as agreed upon by the parties pursuant to Section
8(a)(vi)(A) above (whether through the Mutual Resolution Period or
arbitration), Target may elect, by written notice to Merger Sub within five
(5) Business Days of the determination of the aggregate Impacts amount, to
elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to either (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure all of the Material Defects, including the Material
Defects which have Impacts in excess of the Cure Maximum, (ii) not cure any of
Material Defects, or (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure
only those Material Defects with aggregate Impacts up to, but not exceeding,
the Cure Maximum. If Target elects (i) of the immediately preceding sentence
and any or all of the Material Defects are not cured by the Closing Date, then
Merger Sub can elect to either (a) terminate this Agreement, in which event
this Agreement, without further action of the Parties, shall become null and
void and neither Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this
Agreement, other than those that by their terms survive the termination of
this Agreement, or (b) close subject to the Material Defects with a reduction
of the Adjusted Purchase Price in an amount equal to the total Impacts amount
of such uncured Material Defects, such reduction not to exceed the Cure
Maximum minus the amount of the total Impacts of the cured Material Defects
paid by Target prior to the Closing. If Target elects clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, then Merger Sub can elect, by written notice
to Target within five (5) Business Days after Merger Sub's receipt of Target's
election, to either (a) terminate this Agreement, in which event this
Agreement, without further action of the Parties, shall become null and void
and neither Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this
Agreement, other than those that by their terms survive the termination of
this Agreement, or (b) close subject to the Material Defects with a reduction
of the Adjusted Purchase Price in an amount equal to the Cure Maximum. If
Target elects clause (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 8(a)(vi)(C),
then Merger Sub can elect, by written notice to Target within five (5)
Business Days after Merger Sub's receipt of Target's election, to either (a)
terminate this Agreement, in which event this Agreement, without further
action of the Parties, shall become null and void and neither Party shall have
any further rights or obligations under this Agreement, other than those that
by their terms survive the termination of this Agreement, or (b) close subject
to any Material Defects that are uncured by the Closing Date with a reduction
of the Adjusted Purchase Price in an amount equal to the total Impacts amount
of such uncured Material Defects, such reduction not to exceed the Cure
Maximum minus the amount of the total Impacts of the cured Material Defects
paid by Target prior to the Closing.



(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(s)(ii), Target shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Merger Sub and the Title Company
any and all affidavits or certificates reasonably required by the Title
Company to issue the Title Policy in the form and condition required by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, owner's affidavits and gap
undertakings (provided that any such affidavits and certificates to be
executed by the Target shall be executed by an officer of Target solely in his
or her capacity as such), (including, without limitation a "Non-Imputation
Affidavit" in such form as the Title Company may require in order to issue a
"Non-Imputation Endorsement" with respect to the Knowledge of Target).



(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver any and all affidavits, certificates or other documents reasonably
required by the Title Company to issue the Title Policy in the form and
condition required by this Agreement.

Section 9. Additional Closing Matters.

(a) Prorations and Working Capital Adjustments.

(i) Prorations and Working Capital Adjustments at Closing. It is the intention
of the Parties that, except to the extent set forth in this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall only be responsible for costs and obligations relating to the
Property accruing on the Closing Date and thereafter. In furtherance of this
objective, a statement of prorations and adjustments (the "Proration
Statement") shall be prepared by Target and submitted to Merger Sub for review
not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Proration
Statement shall be limited to the items identified in the Target Identified
Account Listing under the heading "Proration Accounts" and the items set forth
in this Section 9(a)(i), the amounts thereof to be determined in accordance
with the Closing Working Capital Accounting Principles, except that (x) items
described clause (A) below may be determined by reference to the actual tax
bills for the applicable Property and Personal Property, if available, and (y)
items described in clause (B) shall be determined as set forth therein.
Concurrently with its delivery of the Proration Statement, Target shall also
deliver its statement setting forth a good faith estimate of each of the items
of Current Assets and Current Liabilities as of the Closing Date, which shall
be prepared in accordance with the Closing Working Capital Accounting
Principles for each of the Working Capital Accounts set forth in the Target
Identified Account Listing (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). Target
and Merger Sub shall cooperate in finalizing the Proration Statement and
Closing Working Capital Statement prior to the Closing. For avoidance of
doubt, both the Proration Statement and the Closing Working Capital Statement
(and any prorations and adjustments to the amounts therein pursuant to Section
9(a)(ii)) shall be made without duplication and without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein and shall exclude the impact of any action
taken by Parent or Merger Sub on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of
the adjustments and credits set forth in this Section 9(a), Merger Sub shall
be deemed the owner of the Property on the Closing Date. After all such
credits are so determined and given to the Target or Merger Sub, as
applicable, the aggregate amount of such credits in favor of the Merger Sub
shall be subtracted from the aggregate amount of the credits in favor of
Target, and the resulting amount shall be the "Closing Prorations Credit"
(which may be a negative number).

(A) Real Estate Taxes. Real estate taxes and personal property taxes which are
a lien upon or levied against any portion of the Property prior to the Closing
Date, and all pre-Closing Date Current Taxes levied prior to the Closing Date
(to the extent of installments thereof due prior to the Closing Date), shall
be the obligation of and paid by or on behalf of Target and the Target
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date. Further, all taxes in the nature
of rollback or similar taxes charged, assessed or levied based on the prior
use or any change in use of the Land or Improvements prior to Closing shall be
the obligation of and paid by Target and the Target Subsidiaries. All real
estate taxes and personal property taxes (the "Current Taxes") levied against
any portion of the Property with respect to the applicable tax year
(determined, as set forth in Exhibit 9(a)(i)(A) in accordance



with the custom in the county where the Property is located) in which the
Closing occurs shall be prorated and adjusted between the Parties such that
Target is responsible for that portion of the Current Taxes allocable to the
period from the beginning of such tax year to and including the day prior to
the Closing Date, and Merger Sub is responsible for that portion of the
Current Taxes allocable to the period commencing on the Closing Date through
the end of the tax year. Merger Sub shall pay all installments of special
assessments due on and after the Closing Date. In addition, if Target or any
Target Subsidiary has paid any taxes or assessments for or in respect of tax
years commencing on or after the Closing Date, then Merger Sub shall be
responsible for same and the amount thereof shall be credited to Target at
Closing. If the tax bills for the Current Taxes have not been issued by the
Closing Date, Target and Merger Sub agree to use 105% of the amount of the
taxes for the year immediately preceding the Closing for the purpose of
computing the prorations under this Section 9(a)(i)(A). Any refund or rebate
of Current Taxes which is received by or payable to Merger Sub, Target or a
Target Subsidiary after the Closing shall be prorated between Target and
Merger Sub, in the manner provided above, promptly upon receipt. If there are
any open appeals of real estate taxes or assessments for tax years prior to
the tax year in which the Closing occurs, then Merger Sub may continue to
prosecute and control such appeals at Merger Sub's sole expense, and any
rebate or benefit from such appeals shall be solely for the Merger Sub's
account.

(B) Rents. As it relates to (i) rents, late charges, interest receivable,
partial payments and other associated charges and revenues due under any Lease
at the Property (collectively, the "Rents") for the calendar month in which
the Closing Date occurs (the "Closing Month"), and (ii) Rents from tenants who
are not more than thirty (30) days delinquent as of the last day of the
calendar month prior to the Closing Date (the "Prior Month"), Merger Sub and
Target shall prorate, on an accrual basis, and Merger Sub shall provide Target
with a credit for (x) all unpaid Rents from tenants for the Prior Month; and
(y) Target's pro rata share of the total unpaid Rents for the Closing Month,
based upon the number of days in such month, and Target shall provide a credit
to Merger Sub for Merger Sub's pro rata share of the collected Rents received
for the Closing Month; provided, however, such delinquent rents shall be
subject to re-proration and a credit to Target pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii) if
received after the Closing. There shall be no credit granted by Merger Sub to
Target at Closing for delinquent Rents for periods prior to the Prior Month.
From and after the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall have the right to receive
all such Rents and Target shall have no further rights following Closing with
respect to such Rents. Merger Sub has no obligation to collect any past due
Rent and shall have the right to pursue (or not pursue) collection, discount
or eliminate any past due Rent in its sole and absolute discretion. To the
extent Merger Sub collects any Rents allocable to the period prior to the
Closing Date, including any past due Rent, Merger Sub shall retain the same,
but such Rent so collected (less any costs of collection incurred by Merger
Sub) shall be subject to re-proration as set forth in Section 9(a)(ii).

(C) Security Deposits. The full amount of the security and other deposits paid
under the Leases, together with interest thereon (to the extent applicable Law
or the Leases require interest to be paid by the holder of such



deposits), shall become the responsibility of the Merger Sub by operation of
the Merger, and neither Merger Sub nor Target shall receive a credit with
respect thereto.

(D) Utilities. All amounts for water, electric, telephone and all other
utility and fuel charges, fuel on hand (at cost plus sales tax) and any
deposits with utility companies (to the extent possible, utility prorations
shall be handled by meter readings on the Closing Date), to the extent
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date and not accrued for by
Target on the Closing Working Capital Statement, shall be a credit in favor or
Merger Sub, and to the extent attributable to the period from and after the
Closing Date and so accrued on the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be
a credit in favor of Target.

(E) License Fees. Prepaid assignable license and permit fees, to the extent
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date, to the extent not
accrued for by Target on the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be a
credit in favor or Merger Sub, and to the extent attributable to the period
from and after the Closing Date and so accrued on the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be a credit in favor of Target.

(F) Prepaid Insurance. Prepaid premiums for insurance carried by Target
(which, for avoidance of doubt, shall exclude the DandO Tail Policy), which
Merger Sub may, at its election, elect, prior to Closing, to terminate to the
extent attributable to the period from and after the Closing Date and so
accrued on the Closing Working Capital Statement, and any refunds payable to
Target, shall be a credit in favor of Target.

(G) Project Contract Charges. Charges under Project Contracts, to the extent
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date and not accrued for by
Target on the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be a credit in favor or
Merger Sub, and charges under Project Contracts attributable to the period
from and after the Closing Date and so accrued shall be a credit in favor or
Target. All termination charges payable by Target or Surviving Entity with
respect to Excluded Contracts and the other Project Contracts specified under
the headings "Contracts to be Terminated One (1) Business Day Following the
Closing" and "Contracts to be Terminated Post-Transition" set forth on Exhibit
5(q) shall be accrued as a Current Liability on the Closing Working Capital
Statement.



(H) Other Prorations. To the extent that items set forth in the Proration
Statement are not adjusted as set forth above, Target will receive a credit
for such items which are identified in the Target Identified Account Listing
as "Target Proration Credit Accounts" and Merger Sub shall receive a credit
for such items which are identified on the Target Identified Account Listing
as "Sun Proration Credit Accounts."

(I) CapEx Credit. Merger Sub shall receive a credit in the amount of the
aggregate of all CapEx Project Credits determined in accordance with Section
5(r). The amount of such credit at Closing shall be determined based on
Target's written statement of the amount of costs and expenses described
therein delivered



at the closing, and shall not be subject to reproration or adjustment after
the Closing in accordance with Section 9(a)(ii).

(J) Employee Costs. Each of Target and Merger Sub shall be responsible for and
receive credits with respect to those expenses relating to employees as are
set forth in Section 5(i) and Exhibit 5(i). Merger Sub shall receive a credit
in the amount of 50% of the estimated costs and expenses associated with the
Services Employees for the Services Term.

(K) Working Capital. The Target shall receive a credit with respect to all
amounts for Current Assets listed on the Closing Working Capital Statement and
the Merger Sub shall receive a credit with respect to all amounts for Current
Liabilities listed on the Closing Working Capital Statement, in each case,
except to the extent so adjusted pursuant to the immediately preceding clause
(J).



(L) Pending Litigation. Merger Sub shall receive a credit for all insurance
deductibles estimated to be incurred by Merger Sub after the Closing with
respect to insurance claims pending on or before the Closing.



(M) Agreed to Credit. Target shall receive an agreed-to credit in the amount
of $260,000.00 which shall not be subject to reproration or adjustment after
the Closing in accordance with Section 9(a)(ii).

(N) No liabilities included in the determination of any of the foregoing shall
include any amounts for any liability or obligation related to the Debt Payoff
Amount or the Transaction Expense Amount to the extent actually included as a
reduction to the Closing Cash Merger Consideration.

(ii) Re-prorations and Adjustments After Closing.

(A) If, on or before the later of (X) the ninetieth (90th) day following the
Closing or, (Y) the tenth (10th) day following the filing of all Straddle
Returns and the Pre-Closing Tax Returns as provided in Section 10 (the
"Proration Adjustment Deadline"), either Merger Sub or the Shareholder
Representative discovers that any of the prorations or adjustments (other than
as prescribed in Section 9(a)(i)(I)) done at Closing pursuant to this Section
9(a)(ii), were not prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section
9(a)(i), or contains a mathematical error (each a "Discrepancy"), such party
shall notify the other party by written notice including reasonable detail of
the appropriate calculation including copies of any work papers and supporting
information as the other party may reasonably request. In such event, the
Shareholder Representative and Merger Sub shall meet in person, or by phone or
other means if so agreed by both Parties, at least twice within fifteen (15)
days after such notification, and shall attempt in good faith to resolve such
Discrepancy. If such Parties are unable to resolve their differences within
such fifteen (15) day period, then any remaining issues with respect to such
Discrepancy shall be submitted to Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP or, if
Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP is then performing services for one of the Parties
or their Affiliates or is unable to serve, Merger Sub and Shareholder
Representative shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent



certified public accountants (the "Independent Accountant"), to resolve such
disagreement as to the Discrepancy in a final and binding matter after hearing
the views of both Parties. The Independent Accountant shall limit its
determination as to whether the proration or adjustment was prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a)(i) or contains a mathematical
error and shall make a determination as to such Discrepancy as soon as
practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as Merger Sub and the
Shareholder Representative shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and
their resolution of the contested amounts shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be paid by the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Target
Shareholders), on the one hand, and by Merger Sub, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded to the
Shareholder Representative or Merger Sub, respectively, bears to the aggregate
amount actually contested by the Shareholder Representative and Merger Sub.

(B) If upon completion of any re-prorations and adjustments there is a net
credit in Merger Sub's favor (a "Merger Sub Credit"), then within three (3)
Business Days after the final determination of such amount, Shareholder
Representative and Merger Sub shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under
the Escrow Agreement to disburse from the Closing Prorations Escrow Fund by
wire transfer of immediately available funds (1) to Merger Sub, an amount
equal to the Merger Sub Credit, and (2) the balance of the Closing Prorations
Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Distribution
Shareholders in accordance with their respective Distribution Percentages. If
the Merger Sub Credit is greater than the amount held in the Closing
Prorations Escrow Fund, then Shareholder Representative and Merger Sub shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
to disburse from the Indemnification Escrow Fund by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Merger Sub the amount by which the Merger Sub
Credit exceeds the amount in the Closing Prorations Escrow Fund (up to the
amount in the Indemnification Escrow Fund). For avoidance of doubt, Merger
Sub's sole recourse for the Merger Sub Credit shall be to the Closing
Prorations Escrow Fund and the Indemnification Escrow Fund as provided in this
clause (B) and neither Shareholder Representative nor any Target Indemnified
Party shall have any additional liability therefor.

(C) If upon completion of any re-prorations and adjustments there is a net
credit in Target's favor (a "Target Credit"), then within three (3) Business
Days after the final determination of such amount (1) Merger Sub shall deposit
with the Escrow Agent the Target Credit to be added to the Closing Prorations
Escrow Fund, and (2) thereafter Shareholder Representative and Merger Sub
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, to
distribute the entire balance of the Closing Prorations Escrow Fund to the
Exchange Agent to be further disbursed to the Distribution Shareholders in
accordance with their respective Distribution Percentages.

(D) Any payment resulting from re-proration and adjustments as described above
shall not be applied to Losses which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are not
entitled to recover pursuant to Section 12(f)(i)(A).



(E) Following the Closing, Merger Sub shall provide Shareholder
Representative, its employees and agents, with full access to such of the
Merger Sub's facilities, such of the books and records of Target and such of
the former Target employees, during normal business hours, as Shareholder
Representative may reasonably request solely in connection with any matter
described in Section 9(a)(i) and Section 9(a)(ii).

(b) Closing Costs. Merger Sub shall pay for the title searches, zoning
reports, Surveys, all environmental assessment and engineering reviews of
private utility systems with respect to the Property, provided that Parent
shall be responsible for all premiums and other costs related to the RandW
Insurance Policy. Target shall pay all Pre-Closing Dividend Financing Costs.
Merger Sub and Target shall each pay one-half of the expenses related to the
Phase II environmental as agreed to by the Merger Sub and Target. Any and all
real estate transfer taxes (or real estate controlling interest transfer
taxes), documentary stamps, intangible taxes, sales taxes, vehicle transfer
taxes, or other similar Taxes relating to the transaction contemplated herein,
title insurance premiums for the Title Policy (including any endorsements to
the Title Policy requested by Merger Sub (other than the aforementioned zoning
and non-imputation endorsements)), and escrow fees shall be paid by Merger Sub
or Target, as applicable, as set forth on the Exhibit 9(b) hereto. Subject to
the foregoing, the Parties shall be responsible for the fees of their
respective attorneys, accountants and other professionals with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Section 9(b) shall survive
the Closing.

Agreement (excluding rights of Target Shareholders in respect of their own

Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
Shareholder Representative or by Target Shareholder unless such waiver is in
writing signed by the Shareholder Representative;



(M) make any and all determinations and calculations on behalf of each Target
Shareholder with respect to any post-Closing matters as set forth in this

Representative determines, in its discretion, may be necessary, appropriate or
incidental to carrying out any of the foregoing.; and

(O) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

By executing and delivering this Agreement, JSREP, Inc., as the Shareholder
Representative (the "Initial Shareholder Representative"), and by accepting
status as such each successor Shareholder Representative, hereby (a) accepts
its appointment and authorization to act as the Shareholder Representative as
attorney-in-fact and agent on behalf of the Target Shareholders in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and (b) agrees to perform the obligations
and exercise the authority required of and granted to the Shareholder
Representative under the Representative Agreements.

(ii) Authority. Parent, Merger Sub and any other Person (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Entity and each other Buyer Indemnified Party) shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with Shareholder Representative on all matters
relating to this Agreement and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever)



on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Target
Shareholder (other than in connection with the disposition of Dissenting
Shares by the Target Shareholder holding the same) by Shareholder
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Target Shareholder by Shareholder Representative, as being fully
binding upon such Person. Parent, Merger Sub and any other Person (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Entity and each other Buyer Indemnified
Party) shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement and the
Representative Agreements without any liability to, or obligation to inquire
of, any of the Target Shareholders. Notices or communications to or from
Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Target Shareholders not holding Dissenting Shares, subject to Section 2(h)
with respect to Target Shareholders holding Dissenting Shares. Any decision or
action by Shareholder Representative hereunder, including any agreement
between Shareholder Representative and Parent relating to the defense, payment
or settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall constitute a
decision or action of all Target Shareholders not holding Dissenting Shares
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person. No Target
Shareholder not holding Dissenting Shares shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this
Section 9(c), including the power of attorney granted hereby, are independent
and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall not be
terminated by any act of any one or more Target Shareholders, or by operation
of law, whether by death or other event. All actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the Shareholder Representative shall be legally binding upon the
Target Shareholders, and none of the Target Shareholders shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(iii) Shareholder Representative Expense Fund. On behalf of Target
Shareholders, Parent shall deposit the Shareholder Representative Expense
Amount with Shareholder Representative, to be held as the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund. Any other amounts received by the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to paragraph 4(c) of the attached Exhibit P shall be
added to the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund. The Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund shall be used by Shareholder Representative to pay
the expenses incurred by Shareholder Representative in performance of its
duties or exercising its authority under this Agreement, including as provided
in Section 9(c)(i)(N). Once Shareholder Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that Shareholder Representative will not incur any additional
expenses or other payment obligations in its capacity as Shareholder
Representative, then Shareholder Representative shall disburse any remaining
portion of the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund to those Distribution
Shareholders who at the time in questions have delivered Transmittal Letters
pursuant to Section 2(e)(ii) in accordance with their Distribution
Percentages; provided, that, any remaining portion of the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund in respect of Target Shares for which Transmittal
Letters have not yet been delivered by Distribution Shareholders pursuant to
Section 2(e)(ii) shall be paid to the Exchange Agent. Prior to final
disbursement in accordance with the preceding sentence, Shareholder
Representative may make interim disbursements of the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund from time to time in its discretion to the
Distribution Shareholders in accordance with their respective Distribution
Percentages.

(iv) Removal, Etc. The then Shareholder Representative may resign at any time,
and may be removed for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent
of a majority



in interest of the Distribution Shareholders according to each Distribution
Shareholder's Distribution Percentage (the "Majority Holders"). In the event
of the dissolution, death, incapacity, resignation or removal of Shareholder
Representative, a new Shareholder Representative shall be appointed by the
vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy
of the written consent appointing such new Shareholder Representative shall be
sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by Parent;
provided, that until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the
prior Shareholder Representative as described in Section 9(c)(i) above. If at
any time the position of Shareholder Representative shall be vacant, such
vacancy shall, until otherwise determined by the Majority Holders, be filled
by Kristian Jensen III unless and until resignation, dissolution, removal or
death, or if such Person is unavailable or unwilling to serve, Alan Krieger
unless and until its resignation, removal, dissolution or death, or if such
Person is unavailable or unwilling to serve, and thereafter to the
Distribution Shareholder with the next largest Distribution Percentage, and
further determined by age (oldest first) if two or more Distribution
Shareholders have the same Distribution Percentage unless and until his, her
or its resignation, removal or death.

(v) Liability. The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to the
Target Shareholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel,
accountants and other professionals and experts retained by Shareholder
Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The Distribution
Shareholders shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with their
respective Distribution Percentages), indemnify and hold harmless Shareholder
Representative from and against, compensate it for, reimburse it for and pay
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and other amounts
obligated to be paid, arising out of and in connection with its activities as
Shareholder Representative under this Agreement and the other Representative
Agreements (the "Representative Losses"), in each case as such Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred to the extent not funded from the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund which shall be the primary source therefor in all
events to the extent thereof, and with all amounts so provided by Distribution
Shareholders added to the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund; provided,
that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any
portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud,
intentional misconduct or bad faith of Shareholder Representative, Shareholder
Representative shall reimburse the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such gross
negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith.

(vi) Representations and Warranties. The Initial Shareholder Representative as
Shareholder Representative represents and warrants to Merger Sub and Parent
that it:

(A) Is a corporation duly incorporated and in good standing in the State of
Connecticut and has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and the other Representative Agreements, and to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder.



(B) Except as would not reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the
execution, delivery and performance by the initial Shareholder Representative
of this Agreement or any other Representative Agreement to which the initial
Shareholder Representative is (or will be) a party, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will: (A) assuming the taking
of any action by (including any authorization, consent or approval) or in
respect of, or any filing with, any Governmental Entity or court, violate any
provision of any Law applicable to the initial Shareholder Representative; (B)
result in a breach or violation of, or default under, any Charter Document or
contract of initial the Shareholder Representative; or (C) require any action
by (including any authorization, consent or approval) or in respect of
(including notice to), any Person under any contract.



(d) [Intentionally omitted.]

(e) Further Assurances. From time to time prior to the Closing, as and when
requested by any Party, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the execution and
delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions as the
other Parties may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall require any
Party to waive any conditions to its obligation to consummate Closing set
forth in Section 6.

Section 10. Additional Tax Matters.

(a) Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of Target for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the open of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other
Taxes of Target for a Straddle Period that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator or which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period. For clarity's sake, the provisions of
this Section 10(a) shall not apply to real estate or personal property, which
are prorated pursuant to Section 9(a)(i)(A) or real estate transfer taxes or
real estate controlling interest taxes, documentary stamps, intangible taxes,
sales taxes, vehicle transfer taxes or other similar Taxes relating to the
transaction contemplated herein the responsibility for which are allocated
pursuant to Section 9(b).

(b) Straddle Period Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to Surviving Entity as successor to Target for
any Straddle Period (each, a "Straddle Return"), such Straddle Returns shall
be prepared by Parent in a manner consistent with Target's past practice
(unless otherwise required by Law). Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver, at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Return
(including extensions), to the Shareholder Representative a statement setting
forth the amount of Taxes reflected as due on such Straddle Return allocated
to the Target pursuant to Section 10(a) (the "Tax Statement") and copies of
such Straddle Return. The Shareholder Representative shall have the right to
review such Straddle Return and the Tax Statement prior to the filing of such
Straddle Return and, within ten days after the date of receipt by the
Shareholder Representative of any Straddle



Return, to request in writing any reasonable changes to such Straddle Return.
The Parties agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of the review of such Straddle Return and the Tax Statement and
mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Straddle
Return.

(c) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Shareholder Representative shall,
at its expense, prepare or cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns for
Target for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date the initial
due date of which is after the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax
Return"), which Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Entity. All Pre-Closing Tax Returns will be prepared
in a manner consistent with the past practice of Target, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which any Pre-Closing Tax Return is required to be filed, Shareholder
Representative shall (i) submit such Pre-Closing Tax Return to Parent for its
review and (ii) consider in good faith any comments from Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Target shall take into account any
deductions (such as deductions for state taxes on its federal income tax
return and any deductions arising directly as a result of the execution of
this Agreement) to the extent that Target is legally entitled to on its Pre-
Closing Tax Returns.

(d) Tax Payments and Refunds. Parent and Surviving Entity shall be responsible
for the payment of all Taxes due, and are entitled to all Tax refunds
receivable, with respect to each Straddle Return and each Pre-Closing Tax
Return, as these are being adjusted for as part of the working capital
adjustment in Section 9(a).

(e) Cooperation. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Shareholder Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 10(b) and
Section 10(c) and with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Merger Sub and
Target agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to Target relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority. For the avoidance of doubt, all books, records and other documents
provided pursuant to this provision, including records used in the filing of
Tax Returns, shall be provided by Parent, Merger Sub and Target, as
applicable, in electronic format.

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing, allocation, or indemnification
agreements or arrangements to which Target is a Party (other than this
Agreement) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, Target shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(g) Parent and Merger Sub Required Tax Actions. Other than the Drop Down,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates
(including, after the Closing for the avoidance of doubt, Target) to, except
upon the written request of the Shareholder Representative, (i) take any
action relating to Taxes or that could create a Tax liability on the Closing
Date (other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) that is outside
the ordinary course of business of Parent and Merger Sub taken as a whole
consistent with past custom and practice (including with respect to quantity
and frequency), or (ii) make a Tax election for Target effective on or before
the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, shall not take any of the
following actions without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned): (A) file, re-file, supplement or amend any Tax Return of Target
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (B) voluntarily approach



any Governmental Entity regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of Target that were
originally due on or before the Closing Date. Additionally, Merger Sub and
Parent shall ensure that the continuity of business enterprise requirement of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d) is satisfied in connection with the
Merger.

(h) Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties shall not take any action, cause any
action to be taken, fail to take any action or fail to cause any action to be
taken (including any action or failure to act otherwise permitted by this
Section 10) that would prevent the Merger, together with the Drop Down, from
constituting a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(i) FIRPTA. Target shall deliver to Parent an affidavit, dated as of the
Closing Date, and executed by an authorized officer of Target acting solely in
his capacity as such, sworn under penalty of perjury and in form and substance
required under Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Code Section 1445
stating that neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is a "foreign person" as
defined in Code Section 1445 (each, a "FIRPTA Certificate").

Section 11. Default and Remedies.

(a) Target Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) if Target fails to perform in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and Parent and Merger Sub have complied with the terms of this
Agreement, and (A) the Closing fails to occur by the Outside Closing Date due
to Target failing to perform in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
or (B) Target breaches this Agreement and such breach is either not subject to
cure or remains uncured for five (5) Business Days following delivery of
notice by Merger Sub to Target or the Shareholder Representative, or (ii)
Merger Sub exercises its termination right pursuant to Section 5(l), Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by Target and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy, at
law or in equity, to which they are entitled. In addition, if clause (i) or
(ii) above applies, Parent and Merger Sub may terminate this Agreement by
written notice to Target, the Deposit shall be returned to Merger Sub, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to pursue all remedies, at law or in
equity, to which they are entitled.

(b) Parent or Merger Sub Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if either Parent or Merger Sub fail to perform in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and if Target has complied with
the terms of this Agreement, and (i) the Closing fails to occur by the Outside
Closing Date due to Merger Sub or Parent failing to perform in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or (ii) Merger Sub or Parent breach this Agreement
and such breach is either not subject to cure or remains uncured for five (5)
Business Days following delivery of notice by Target to Merger Sub or Parent,
Target may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
and the Deposit shall be forfeited to Target as liquidated damages and Parent
and Target shall jointly instruct to the Title Company to pay the Deposit to
Target. Target, Merger Sub, and Parent acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Deposit is a reasonable estimate of and bears a reasonable relationship to the
damages that would be suffered and costs that would be incurred by Target as a
result of having subjected the Target Shares to the terms of this Agreement
and the failure of the Closing to occur due to a default of Merger Sub or
Parent under this Agreement; (ii) the actual damages suffered and costs
incurred by Target as a result of such subjection and failure to close due to
a default of Merger Sub or Parent under this Agreement would be extremely
difficult and impractical to determine; (iii) Merger Sub and Parent seek to
limit their liability under this Agreement to the amount of the Deposit in the
event the Closing does not occur due to a default of Merger Sub or Parent
under this Agreement; and (iv) the Deposit shall be and constitute valid
liquidated damages.



Section 12. Indemnification.

(a) Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, (a) the General Representations and Parent General Representations
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the
end of the Survival Period; (b) the representations and warranties set forth

3(b) [Capitalization], Section 3(c) [Authorization], Section 3(e) [Personal
Property], Section 3(g) [Employee Benefits], Section 3(j) [Indebtedness],
Section 3(k) [Transaction Expense], Section 4(a) [Corporate Power], Section

Date; (c) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3(ee) and
Section 4(i) [Taxes and Tax Treatment] shall survive until the date that is

the representations and warranties (i) with respect to any zoning Law
applicable to the Property contained in Section 3(n), and (ii) contained in
Section 3(ff) shall each terminate as of the Closing Date. All covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained herein: (i) which contemplates continuance
until a specified date or for a specified period shall survive until sixty
(60) days after the last specified date or the last day of such specified
period such covenant or agreement imposes an obligation on such Party or
Parties, and (ii) which does not contemplate continuance until a specified
date or for a specified period, shall survive the Closing indefinitely.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement prior to the expiration date of the
applicable survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of
the relevant representation or warranty, or covenant and such claims shall
survive until finally resolved.

(b) Indemnification by Target Indemnifying Parties. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Section 12, following the Closing, the Target
Indemnifying Parties, severally and not jointly (in accordance with their
respective Distribution Percentages), shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against, and
shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnified Parties based upon,
arising out of, or attributable to:

(i) subject to Section 5(l), any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of the Target contained in this Agreement, or in
any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Target pursuant
to this Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or
as if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date);

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Target (and not the Surviving Entity) or Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any claim made by any Person (other than Shareholder Representative,
Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent) (including any of the Target
Shareholders) relating to (A) such Person's rights with respect to the Merger
Consideration, or (B) the calculations and determinations set forth pursuant
to clauses (a) or (b) of Section 9 having not been made in compliance
therewith;

Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Closing to the extent not paid or satisfied

Adjusted Purchase Price; or

(vi) any New Hampshire Statutory Claim.

(c) Indemnification by Parent and Surviving Entity. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Section 12, following the Closing, Parent and Surviving
Entity, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and defend each of the Target
Indemnified Parties against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, such Target Indemnified Parties
based upon, arising out of, or attributable to:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date);

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement;

(d) Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in Section 12(b) and
Section 12(c) shall be subject to the following limitations:

(i) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12(b)(i) based upon, arising out of, attributable to any inaccuracy in
or breach of the General Representations until the aggregate amount of all
Losses with respect to such General Representations exceeds an amount equal to
$859,000.00 (the "Basket"), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification for such Losses in excess of the Basket,
subject to the other limitations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled pursuant to Section 12(b)(i) based upon, arising out of,
attributable to any inaccuracy in or breach of:

(A) the General Representations and Special Representations shall not exceed
the Retention Escrow Amount (the "General Cap"); and



(B) the General Representations, the Special Representations and the
Fundamental Representations shall not exceed $5,000,000.00 (the "Overall
Cap").

(ii) Parent and Surviving Entity shall not be liable to the Target Indemnified
Parties for indemnification under Section 12(c)(i) until the aggregate amount
of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 12(c)(i) exceeds the
Basket, in which event Parent and Surviving Entity shall be required to pay or
be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Basket, subject to the other
limitations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Parent and Surviving Entity shall be liable,
collectively, pursuant to Section 12(c)(i) based upon, arising out of,
attributable to any inaccuracy in or breach of:

(A) the Parent General Representations shall not exceed the General Cap;

(B) the Parent General Representations and Parent Fundamental Representations
shall not exceed $27,500,000.00.

(iii) For avoidance of doubt, the limitations with respect to the Basket and
the General Cap shall not apply to Losses based upon, arising out of, or
attributable to any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation
or Parent Fundamental Representation.

(iv) For purposes of this Section 12, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty (other than those in Section 3(cc), and the
determination of any Losses with respect thereto, shall be determined without
regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty.

(v) The recovery by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section 12 shall
be net of any reimbursement actually received from any insurance carrier
(other than the insurer providing the RandW Insurance Policy) or other third
person (net of increased premiums and costs reasonably incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in seeking or obtaining such reimbursement), in either
case, in connection with the Losses that form the basis of the Buyer
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification hereunder.

(vi) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under this
Section 12 to the extent the matter in question was addressed in the
prorations and adjustments set forth in Section 9(a).

(e) Indemnification Procedures. A Buyer Indemnified Party or Target
Indemnified Party making a claim under this Section 12(e) is referred to as
the "Indemnified Party", and the Party against whom such claims are asserted
under this Section 12(e) is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party". For
purposes of this Section 12, (i) if Parent (or any other Buyer Indemnified
Party) comprises the Indemnified Party, any references to Indemnifying Party
(except provisions relating to an obligation to make payments) shall be deemed
to refer to Shareholder Representative, and any references to Indemnified
Party shall refer to Parent, and (ii) if any Target Indemnified Parties
comprises the Indemnified Party any references to Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to refer to Parent, and any references to the Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to refer to the Shareholder Representative. Any payment received by
Shareholder Representative



as the Indemnified Party shall be added to and disbursed from the Shareholder
Representative Expense Fund in accordance with Section 9(c).

(i) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who
is not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement.
any other Buyer Indemnified Party or Target Indemnified Party, or a
Representative of any of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Section 12, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice
of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party is Shareholder
Representative, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly
by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer of Merger Sub in
its capacity as such, or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Parties, so long as in either case the Indemnified
Party diligently pursues the defense of such third party claim. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
subject to Section 12(e)(ii), it shall have the right to take such action as
it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims
pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to
the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of independent counsel to
the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party's independent counsel reasonably determines such counsel is
required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such
Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing
of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to Section 12(e)(ii), pay, compromise, defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Shareholder Representative
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making
available records relating to such Third Party Claim and the facts or matters
giving rise thereto and furnishing, without expense (other than



reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation and carrying out of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(ii) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 12(e)(ii). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third
Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party, and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim, and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten
(10) calendar days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails
to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 12(e)(i), it
shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(iii) Direct Claims. Any Proceeding by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise
materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have sixty
(60) calendar days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to Target's premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such sixty (60) calendar)
day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
Direct Claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

to the then Total Retention Amount under the RandW Insurance Policy;

(B) Thereafter such Losses shall be satisfied by the RandW Insurance Policy; and

(C) In the event that the aggregate amount of all Losses under Section

satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Fund up to the amount thereof.

terms of the Escrow Agreement, (B) the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (C) the New Hampshire Indemnity Fund

and the Parent shall issue instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay any amounts
remaining in the Retention Escrow Fund, the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the
New Hampshire Indemnity Fund and the Environmental Escrow Fund, as applicable,
to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Distribution Shareholders in
accordance with their respective Distribution Percentages.

(viii) For the avoidance of doubt, no Target Indemnifying Party shall have any
obligation to satisfy any Losses under this Section 12 other than to the
extent of it interest in, and solely from, the Retention Escrow Fund, the
Indemnification Escrow Fund and the New Hampshire Indemnity Fund.

(g) Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.



(h) Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its principals, shareholders, directors, officers, partners, agents or
employees) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party, or any of its
representatives, knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

Merger Sub (each for itself and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties)

and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud (as defined by statute or
the common law) or criminal activity or violation of applicable securities
laws on the part of a Party hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 12. In furtherance of the
foregoing Parent and Merger Sub (each for itself and on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties) and Target (for itself and on behalf of the Target
Indemnified Parties) each hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein

against the other Parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their

("Action") involving a Financing Source that is in any way related to this

including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Pre Closing Dividend Financing or any commitment letter or financing

virtue of any prior or subsequent such default, misrepresentation, or breach

(m) Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.



(n) Representation of Stockholders and Seller Representative. The Parent and
Merger Sub agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, that, following the Closing, Reid and Riege, P.C. (which term shall
include each of the individual attorneys of such firm) may serve as counsel
to, and that CohnReznick LLP (which term shall include each of the individual
accountants of such firm) may serve as accountants to, any one or more Target
Shareholders, the Shareholder Representative, or any of their Affiliates in
connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Transaction Agreements, including any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any other matters,
notwithstanding any representation by Reid and Riege, P.C. or engagement or
provision of services by CohnReznick LLP prior to the Closing of the Target,
any of the Target Subsidiaries, or the Shareholder Representative or any of
their Affiliates (collectively the "Covered Parties"). To the extent that Reid
and Riege, P.C. enjoys attorney-client privilege or that CohnReznick LLP
enjoys accountant-client privilege with any of the Covered Parties, Parent and
Merger Sub (for itself and on behalf of the Surviving Entity) each hereby (i)
waive any claim they have or may have that Reid and Riege, P.C. or CohnReznick
LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in
such representation, and (ii) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises
out this Agreement after the Closing between any Buyer Indemnified Party on
the one hand, and any Covered Party, on the other, Reid and Riege, P.C. may
represent, and CohnReznick LLP may provide services to, such Covered Person in
such dispute even though the interests of such person(s) may be directly
adverse to Parent or Surviving Entity or any other Buyer Indemnified Party and
even though Reid and Riege, P.C. may have represented, or CohnReznick LLP may
have been engaged by or provided services to, such Covered Person in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Parent and Merger Sub (for itself and
on behalf of the Surviving Entity) also further agree that, as to all
communications among Reid and Riege, P.C. or CohnReznick LLP, on the one hand,
and any Covered Person, on the other hand, that relate in any way to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to and may
be controlled by the Shareholder Representative and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Parent, Merger Sub or Surviving Entity. To the extent any files of
Reid and Riege, P.C. or CohnReznick LLP for the Target, any Target Subsidiary
or the Shareholder Representative in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but not in respect to any other
matter) constitute property of the client, only the Shareholder Representative
(and not the Merger Sub or Surviving Entity) will hold such property rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Parent or Surviving Entity, on the one hand, and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement or a Target Indemnified Party after the Closing, the
Surviving Entity may assert (i) the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Reid and Riege, P.C. to such
third party and (ii) the accountant-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by CohnReznick LLP to such third party, as
applicable.

(o) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HERETO AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES EACH
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, SUIT, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION, INQUIRY,
PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO,
BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRE-CLOSING DIVIDEND
FINANCING, THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND
WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO THAT THIS
SECTION 13(O) CONSTITUTES A



MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF
THIS SECTION 13(O) WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH
SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

(p) Limitation on Warranties. Except as expressly set forth in Section 3, (i)
the Target makes no express or implied warranty of any kind whatsoever,
including any representation as to physical condition or value of any of the
property or assets of the Target or any Target Subsidiary, the future
profitability or future earnings performance of the Target or any Target
Subsidiary or compliance with the HSR Act and (ii) no covenants, warranties or
representations are made, or have been made, by Target or any of its
representatives or agents with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any
information contained in the Offering Memorandum for the Jensen Communities
Portfolio distributed by Robert Charles Lesser and Co., LLC (the "Confidential
Information Memorandum") or in the management presentation or Data Room and
none of them shall have any liability to Parent or Merger Sub arising out of
the use of the information contained in such Confidential Information
Memorandum or such management presentation or Data Room materials. THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET IN SECTION 3 CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND PARENT AND MERGER SUB UNDERSTAND,
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING
TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS
OR LIABILITIES OF TARGET, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY TARGET AND PARENT AND
MERGER SUB ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH IS NOT RELYING ON ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

herein shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular
and plural forms thereof. The term "person" shall be construed broadly to
include any individual, any type of business entity (including a corporation,
joint-stock company, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association or unincorporated association), any other type of legal entity
(including a trust), or any other entity or organization, but shall not
include any Governmental Authority. The terms "including," "includes,"
"include" and words of like import shall be construed broadly as if followed
by the words "without limitation" or "but not limited to." The terms "herein,"
"hereunder," "herewith," "hereby" and "hereof" and words of like import,
unless otherwise stated, refer to this entire Agreement as a whole (including
any Schedules and Exhibits) and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and Article, Section, Schedule and Exhibit references are to the
Articles, Sections, Schedules and Exhibits of this Agreement unless otherwise
specified. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached
hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in
this Agreement. The term "pending" shall mean pending (but shall not be
construed as referring to any action, suit or proceeding against the Target or
any Target Subsidiary that has been filed but not yet served on Target or any
Target Subsidiary, as applicable), and "threatened" means threatened (and
shall be construed as referring, without limitation, to any action, suit or
proceeding against the Target that has been filed but not yet served on the
Target). The words describing the singular number will include the plural and
vice versa. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement will mean that the
information referred to has been made available if requested by the party to
whom such information is to be made available and such requested information
shall be deemed to have been "made available" if such information has been
posted to a public website, including the SEC's Edgar site, or an electronic
datasite, including the Data Room, that is accessible by such requesting party
or a representative thereof (other than with respect



to the tenant information, documents and communications; leases; sales
information and contracts; and work orders which were made available by Target
to Parent and Merger Sub by providing online access to Target's Laserfiche
facility and utility bills and information which were was made available by
Target to Parent and Merger Sub by proving online access to Target's
Avidutility facility or such requested information has been emailed or
otherwise sent to such requesting party or representative or such requesting
party or representative otherwise has knowledge of how to obtain access to
such requested information. All references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. The word "or"
is not exclusive. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein:
(a) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement,
instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time
to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof and by this
Agreement; and (b) to a statute means such statute in effect as of the Closing

thereto and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(r) Jurisdiction.

(i) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its
