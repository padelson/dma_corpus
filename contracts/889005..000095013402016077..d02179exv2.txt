                           paid by Seller, actually received by Seller and
                           directly attributable to the Wells which are, in
                           accordance with generally accepted accounting
                           procedures, attributable to Buyer pursuant to Section
                           4.2;

                  (ii)     an amount equal to all expenditures, liabilities and
                           costs (whether capitalized or expensed) relating to
                           the Assets that are unpaid as of the Closing Date and
                           assessed for or attributable to periods of time prior
                           to the Effective Time regardless of how such
                           expenditures, liabilities or costs are calculated,
                           provided that to the extent the actual amounts cannot
                           be determined prior to the agreement of Buyer and
                           Seller with respect to the Closing Adjustment
                           Statement, a reasonable estimate of such
                           expenditures, liabilities and costs shall be used
                           (and to such extent Buyer shall assume the liability
                           and responsibility for payment up to such estimate);

                  (iii)    all amounts owed by Seller to third parties as of the

                           measured in accordance with Section 4.2, such amounts
                           to be determined for Imbalances by multiplying the
                           Imbalance volume by $1.50 per MMBtu;

                  (iv)     all amounts related to Title Defects as determined

                           Section 15.1; and

                  (v)      an amount equal to each Seller's proportionate share
                           of Asset Taxes for any tax year which the Effective
                           Time splits, (prorated between Buyer and each Seller
                           as of the Effective Time) based on the number of days
                           in the tax year which fall on each side of the
                           Effective Time; and;

<PAGE>


                  (vi)     any other amount agreed upon in writing by Seller and
                           Buyer.

                  The term "Imbalance" means any Oil and Gas production or
                  pipeline imbalance existing as of the Effective Time with
                  respect to any of the Assets, together with any related rights
                  or obligations as to future cash and/or gas or product
                  balancing, as a result of production or pipeline delivery
                  imbalances. Seller shall remain responsible for any pipeline
                  imbalance penalties

         (C)      Seller shall have the right to collect any receivable, refund
                  or other amounts associated with periods prior to the
                  Effective Time. To the extent that Buyer collects any such
                  receivable, refund or other amounts, then Buyer shall promptly
                  remit any such amounts to Seller.

2.3      Allocation. The Base Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Assets as
         set forth in Exhibit 2.3. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree that the
         values allocated to various portions of the Assets, which are set forth
         on Exhibit 2.3 (singularly with respect to each item, the "Allocated
         Value" and collectively, the "Allocated Values"), shall be binding on
         Seller and Buyer and shall be used for the purposes of adjusting the
         Base Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 5.5 (relating to Title
         Defects), 6.4 (relating to Adverse Environmental Conditions), 9.3
         (relating to Preferential Rights) and 15.1 (relating to Casualty
         Losses) and is not intended as a measure of value for any other
         purpose.

2.4      Allocation For Tax Purposes. For the purpose of making the requisite
         filings under Section 1060 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
         amended, (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder, Seller and Buyer
         shall, within one hundred-twenty (120) days following the Closing Date,
         agree to allocate, in a manner consistent with the allocation set forth
         on Exhibit 2.3, the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted by Section 2.2)
         and all obligations assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3 among the
         Assets. Seller and Buyer each agree to report the federal, state and
         local income and other Tax consequences of the transactions
         contemplated herein, and in particular to report the information
         required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to jointly prepare Form
         8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in a manner
         consistent with such allocation and shall not take any position
         inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax return, in any
         refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise. Seller and
         Buyer agree that each shall furnish the other a copy of Form 8594
         (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) proposed to be filed
         with the Internal Revenue Service by such Party or any affiliate
         thereof within ten (10) days prior to the filing of such form with the
         Internal Revenue Service. Seller and Buyer each agree to report the
         federal, state and local income and other Tax consequences of the
         transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to report the
         information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to jointly
         prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in a
         manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement (including the
         allocation set forth in Exhibit 2.3, the Post Closing Adjustment
         Statement and the amounts of the Assumed Liabilities) and shall not
         take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax
         return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or
         otherwise unless required to do so by applicable law after notice to
         and discussion with the other Party, or with such other Party's prior
         consent. Seller and Buyer agree that each shall furnish the other a
         copy of Form

4.       ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS.

4.1      Closing Adjustments. With respect to matters that can be determined as
         of the Closing, Seller shall prepare, in accordance with the provisions
         of Article 2 and this Article 4, a statement (the "Closing Adjustment
         Statement") with relevant supporting information setting forth each
         adjustment to the Base Purchase Price submitted by Seller. Seller shall
         submit the Closing Adjustment Statement to Buyer, together with all
         records or data supporting the calculation of amounts presented on the
         Closing Adjustment Statement, no later than five (5) business days
         prior to the scheduled Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and
         Seller shall review the adjustments proposed by Seller in the Closing
         Adjustment Statement. Agreed upon adjustments shall be taken into
         account in computing any adjustments to be made to the Base Purchase
         Price at the Closing. When available, actual figures will be used for
         the adjustments at Closing. To the extent actual figures are not
         available, estimates shall be used subject to final adjustments as
         described in Section 4.3 below.

4.2      Strapping and Gauging. Seller has caused the Oil and Gas in the storage
         facilities located on, or utilized in connection with, the Leases to be
         measured, gauged or strapped as of the Effective Time. Seller has
         caused the production meter charts (or if such do not exist, the sales
         meter charts) on the pipelines transporting Oil and Gas from the Leases
         to be read as of such time. The Oil and Gas in such storage facilities
         above the pipeline connection or through the meters on the pipelines
         prior to the Effective Time shall belong to Seller, and the Oil and Gas
         placed in such storage facilities from and after the Effective Time and
         production upstream of the aforesaid meters shall belong to Buyer and
         become part of the Assets.

4.3      Post-Closing Adjustments.

         (A)      A post-closing adjustment statement (the "Post-Closing
                  Adjustment Statement") based on the actual income and expenses
                  shall be prepared and delivered by Seller to Buyer within one
                  hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing, proposing further
                  adjustments to the calculation of the Purchase Price based on
                  the information then available. Seller or Buyer, as the case
                  may be, shall be given access to and shall be entitled to
                  review and audit the other Party's records pertaining to the
                  computation of amounts claimed in such Post-Closing Adjustment
                  Statement.

         (B)      Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Post-Closing
                  Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written
                  statement describing in reasonable detail its objections (if
                  any) to any amounts or items set forth on or omitted from the
                  Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. If Buyer does not raise
                  objections within such period, then the Post-Closing
                  Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
                  Parties at the end of such period.



                                       8

<PAGE>


         (C)      If Buyer raises objections, the Parties shall negotiate in
                  good faith to resolve any such objections. If the Parties are
                  unable to resolve any disputed item within thirty (30) days
                  after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written objections to the
                  Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, any such disputed item
                  shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent
                  accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Parties who shall be
                  instructed to resolve such disputed item within thirty (30)
                  days. The resolution of disputes by the accounting firm so
                  selected shall be set forth in writing and shall be
                  conclusive, binding and non-appealable upon the Parties and
                  the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall become final and
                  binding upon the Parties on the date of such resolution. The
                  fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be paid
                  one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

         (D)      After the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement has become final
                  and binding on the Parties, Seller or Buyer, as the case may
                  be, shall pay to the other such sums as are due to settle
                  accounts between the Parties due to differences between the
                  estimated Purchase Price paid pursuant to the Closing
                  Adjustment Statement and the actual Purchase Price set forth
                  on the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.

4.4      Suspended Funds. After the Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer a
         listing showing all proceeds from production attributable to the Leases
         which are currently held in suspense and shall transfer to Buyer all of
         those suspended proceeds. BUYER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPER
         DISTRIBUTION OF ALL THE SUSPENDED PROCEEDS, TO THE EXTENT TURNED OVER
         TO IT BY SELLER, TO THE PARTIES LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO THEM AND ANY
         CLAIMS RELATED THERETO, AND BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND
         AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES AS DEFINED
         BELOW ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THOSE SUSPENDED PROCEEDS UNLESS A
         CLAIM ALLEGES THAT SELLER UNLAWFULLY SUSPENSED ALL OR ANY PORTION OF
         SUCH PROCEEDS, IN WHICH CASE SELLER SHALL NOT BE INDEMNIFIED.

4.5      Audit Adjustments. Subject to the Survival Period, Seller retains all
         rights and obligations relating to adjustments resulting from any
         operating agreement and other audit claims asserted against third party
         operators on transactions occurring prior to the Effective Time (which
         includes Buyer, if applicable). Any credit received by Buyer pertaining
         to such an audit claim shall be paid to Seller within thirty (30) days
         after receipt, less Seller's pro rata share of the costs of conducting
         any such audit.

4.6      Asset Tax Refunds. Refunds of Asset Taxes paid (or to the extent
         payable but not paid due to offset against other Taxes) with respect to
         or attributable to the Assets shall be promptly paid (or retained, as
         appropriate)by the Party receiving the benefit of the payment or offset
         as follows): (i) to Seller if attributable to Asset Taxes with respect
         to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on or before the Effective
         Time; and (ii) to Buyer if attributable to Asset Taxes with respect to
         any Tax year or portion thereof beginning from and after the Effective
         Time.

4.7      Cooperation. Each Party covenants and agrees to promptly inform the
         other with respect to amounts owing under Sections 4.3, 4.5, 4.6 and
         this Section 4.7. Further, upon and after Closing and subject to and
         except as provided otherwise under the terms of this Agreement and
         except to the extent for which adjustments or an accounting under this
         Agreement has been made, (a) all monies, refunds, proceeds, receipts,
         credits, receivables, accounts and income attributable to the Assets
         conveyed hereunder (1) for all periods of time from and after the
         Effective Time shall be the property and entitlement of Buyer, and, to
         the extent received by Seller, Seller shall fully disclose and account
         therefore to Buyer promptly, and (2) for the period of time prior to
         the Effective Time shall be the sole property and entitlement of Seller
         and to the extent received by Buyer, Buyer shall fully disclose and
         account therefore to Seller promptly and, similarly, (b) all operating
         expenses and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and
         operation of the Assets (1) prior to the Effective Time shall be the
         sole responsibility of Seller and Seller shall promptly pay, or if paid
         by Buyer, promptly reimburse Buyer for same and (2) from and after the
         Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Buyer and Buyer shall
         promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for same.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.7 shall not apply to
         Asset Taxes, which are covered by Section 4.6 above.

5.       DUE DILIGENCE; TITLE MATTERS.

5.1      General Access.  Prior to Closing, Seller shall:

         (A)      Give Buyer and its representatives, employees, consultants,
                  independent contractors, attorneys and other advisors
                  reasonable access to the Leases, Contracts and Records in
                  Seller's possession or control and other Assets during regular
                  office hours;

         (B)      Use reasonable efforts to obtain and submit to Buyer or its
                  representatives as promptly as practicable, copies of such
                  documents as Buyer may reasonably request; and

         (C)      Furnish to Buyer all other information with respect to the
                  Assets as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request,
                  unless Seller is prohibited therefrom by any agreement,
                  contract, obligation or duty by which it is bound or by the
                  necessity of any third party approval; provided that, if
                  requested by Buyer, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
                  obtain the waiver of any such prohibition or the granting of
                  any such approval.

5.2      Seller's Title.

         (A)      The documents to be executed and delivered by Seller to Buyer
                  transferring the Assets to Buyer shall be subject to the
                  Permitted Encumbrances and shall be substantially in the form
                  set forth in Exhibit 3.2(A). Seller shall warrant and defend
                  the Assets unto Buyer against every person lawfully claiming
                  the Assets or any part thereof, by, through or under Seller,
                  but not otherwise. However, subject to representations and
                  warranties made herein and further subject to the conveyancing
                  documents, all of Seller's interests in the Assets are to be
                  sold AS IS AND WHERE IS AND

                  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, CONDITION OR FITNESS FOR
                  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

         (B)      Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not
                  covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become successor operator
                  of all or any portion of the Assets, since the Assets or
                  portions thereof may be subject to unit, pooling,

5.4      Defect Letters.

         (A)      Buyer may from time to time and no later than January 31,
                  2003, notify Seller in writing (a "Notice") of any liens,
                  charges, contracts, obligations, encumbrances, defects and
                  irregularities of title which would cause title to all or part
                  of the Assets not to be good and marketable as defined in
                  Section 5.3 hereof, or which would cause a breach of a
                  representation or warranty of Seller ("Title Defect"),
                  provided that no Title Defect shall be deemed to exist unless
                  (i) the Title Defect Value thereof exceeds Fifty Thousand
                  Dollars ($50,000.00) ; and, (ii) the aggregate Title Defect
                  Values of all Title Defects satisfying the condition in clause
                  (i) exceed one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) of the Base
                  Purchase Price (the "Title Defect Hurdle Rate"). In order to
                  provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to cure any Title
                  Defects prior to Closing, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts
                  to provide the Notice as soon as reasonably possible after
                  becoming aware of or making its determination of the Title
                  Defect.

         (B)      In the Notice, Buyer must describe with reasonable detail each
                  alleged Title Defect it has discovered and the actions to cure
                  each Title Defect, include Buyer's reasonable estimate of the
                  Title Defect Value attributable to each, and include all data
                  and information in Buyer's possession or control bearing
                  thereon.

         (C)      Without limiting the special warranty in the conveyance
                  documents, (a) Buyer shall be deemed to have conclusively
                  waived any remedy under this Article 5 for all Title Defects
                  not disclosed to Seller in a Notice under this Article 5
                  before January 31, 2003 and (b) Buyer waives any remedy
                  against Seller under this Article 5 for Title Defects that do
                  not exceed the Title Defect Hurdle Rate; provided, however,
                  once such amount exceeds the Title Defect Hurdle Rate, Buyer
                  shall be entitled to recover all amounts to which it is
                  entitled in excess of the Title Defect Hurdle Rate.

         (D)      Upon timely delivery of a Notice by Buyer:

                  (i)      within five (5) days after Seller's receipt of the
                           Title Defects Notice, Seller shall notify Buyer
                           whether Seller agrees with Buyer's claimed Title
                           Defects and/or the proposed Title Defect Values
                           therefore ("Seller's Response"). If Seller does not
                           agree with any claimed Title Defect and/or the
                           proposed Title Defect Value therefore, then the
                           Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations and
                           shall attempt to agree on such matters;

                  (ii)     within five (5) days after Seller's notice of its
                           cure of a Title Defect, Buyer shall notify Seller
                           whether Buyer agrees with Seller's cure of a Title
                           Defect ("Buyer's Response"). If Buyer does not agree
                           with any such cure, then the Parties shall enter into
                           good faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree on
                           such matters;

                  (iii)    if, within ten (10) days prior to Closing, the
                           Parties cannot reach agreement concerning the
                           existence of a Title Defect, Seller's proposed cure
                           of a Title Defect, or a Title Defect Value, then upon
                           either Party's request, the Parties shall mutually
                           agree on and employ an attorney experienced in title
                           examination in the state where the Assets are
                           located, or any other professional mutually agreed
                           upon by the Parties, ("Title Consultant") to resolve
                           all points of disagreement relating to Title Defects
                           and Title Defect Values; provided that Seller may
                           elect not to proceed to Closing with regard to such
                           Assets and adjust the Base Purchase Price in the
                           amount of the Allocated Value and not submit such
                           matter to the Title Consultant; and

                  (iv)     if at any time any Title Consultant so chosen fails
                           or refuses to perform hereunder, a new Title
                           Consultant shall be chosen by the Parties. The cost
                           of any such Title Consultant shall be borne fifty
                           percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
                           Buyer. Each Party shall present a written statement
                           of its position on the Title Defect and/or Title
                           Defect Value in question to the Title Consultant
                           within five (5) days after the Title Consultant is
                           selected, and the Title Consultant shall make a
                           determination of all points of disagreement in
                           accordance with the terms and conditions of this
                           Agreement within ten (10) business days of receipt of
                           such position statements. The determination by the
                           Title Consultant shall be conclusive and binding on
                           the Parties, and shall be enforceable against any
                           Party in any court of competent jurisdiction. Once
                           the Title Consultant's determination has been
                           expressed to both Parties, if applicable, Seller
                           shall have five (5) days in which to advise Buyer in
                           writing which of the options available to Seller
                           under Section 5.5 that Seller elects regarding each
                           of the Assets as to which the Title Consultant has
                           made a determination.

5.5      Effect of Title Defect.

         (A)      In the event Buyer provides Seller with a timely Notice and
                  the Title Defects are valid and exceed the Title Defect Hurdle
                  Rate, for those Title Defects not cured by Closing, Seller
                  may, at its sole discretion:

                  (i)      adjust the Base Purchase Price in the amount of the
                           Title Defect Value of the Asset to which such Title
                           Defect relates; provided that Seller shall not be
                           obligated to adjust the Purchase Price in an amount
                           in excess of such Asset's Allocated Value; or

                  (ii)     elect to cure such Title Defect; provided, however,
                           that if Title Defect has not been cured on or before
                           July 31, 2003, Buyer shall reassign such Asset to
                           Seller and concurrently therewith Seller shall pay to
                           Buyer the Allocated Value of such Asset (net of all
                           revenues received by Buyer less all expenses paid by
                           Buyer) together with Interest on such amount from the
                           Closing to the date of payment.

         (B)      The diminution in value of an Asset attributable to a valid
                  Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value") notified in a Notice
                  shall be determined by the following:

                  (i)      if the valid Title Defect asserted is that the actual
                           Net Revenue Interest attributable to any Well is less
                           than that stated in the applicable Exhibit with a
                           proportionate decrease in the Working Interest, then
                           the Title Defect Value is the product of the
                           Allocated Value attributed to such Asset, multiplied
                           by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                           difference between the Net Revenue Interest set forth
                           in the applicable Exhibit and the actual Net Revenue
                           Interest, and the denominator of which is the Net
                           Revenue Interest stated in the applicable Exhibit; or

                  (ii)     if the valid Title Defect represents an obligation,
                           encumbrance, burden or charge upon the affected Asset
                           (including any increase in Working Interest for which
                           there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue
                           Interest), the amount of the Title Defect Value is to
                           be determined by taking into account the Allocated
                           Value of the Asset, the portion of the Asset affected
                           by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
                           Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title
                           Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and the
                           Title Defect Values placed upon the Title Defect by
                           Buyer and Seller.

                  Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall the total of the
                  Title Defect Values related to a particular Asset exceed the
                  Allocated Value of such Asset.

6.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT.

6.1      Physical Condition of the Assets. The Assets have been used for oil and
         gas drilling and production operations and possibly for the storage and
         disposal of waste materials or hazardous substances related to standard
         oil field operations. Physical changes in or under the Assets or
         adjacent lands may have occurred as a result of such uses. The Assets
         also may contain buried pipelines and other equipment, whether or not
         of a similar nature, the locations of which may not now be known by
         Seller or be readily apparent by a physical inspection of the Assets.
         Buyer understands that Seller does not have the requisite information
         with which to determine the exact nature or condition of the Assets nor
         the effect any such use has had on the physical condition of the
         Assets. Pursuant to the Safe Water Drinking and Toxic Enforcement Act
         of 1986, Buyer is hereby notified and assumes the risk that detectable
         amounts of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects and other
         reproductive harm may be found in, on or around the Assets although
         Seller is not aware that this is the case. Subject to the further
         provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall assume the risk that the
         Assets may contain waste or contaminants and that adverse physical
         conditions, including the presence of waste or contaminants, may not
         have been revealed by Buyer's investigation. Except as otherwise
         provided in this Agreement, all responsibility and liability related to
         disposal, spills, waste or contamination on or below the Assets shall
         be transferred from Seller to Buyer.

         In addition, Buyer acknowledges that some oil field production
         equipment located on the Assets may contain asbestos and/or naturally
         occurring radioactive material ("NORM"). In



                                       16

<PAGE>

         this regard, Buyer expressly understands that NORM may affix or attach
         itself to inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale or in other
         forms, and that wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets
         described herein may contain NORM and that NORM-containing materials
         may be buried or have been otherwise disposed of on the Assets. Buyer
         also expressly understands that special procedures may be required for
         the removal and disposal of asbestos and NORM from the Assets where
         they may be found, and that Buyer assumes all liability when such
         activities are performed.

6.2      Inspection and Testing.

         (A)      Buyer shall have the right, at its sole cost and risk, to
                  conduct a Phase I environmental assessment of the Assets to
                  the extent that Seller has the authority to grant such right
                  to Buyer. Buyer shall provide to Seller any plan for such an
                  environmental assessment prior to commencement of field work.
                  Any data obtained shall be promptly provided to Seller,
                  including any reports and conclusions. Seller and Buyer shall
                  keep all information strictly confidential whether or not
                  Closing occurs, except as may be required pursuant to any
                  Environmental Laws or other legal requirements.

         (B)      Buyer waives and releases all claims against Seller, its
                  parent and subsidiary companies, and each of their respective
                  directors, officers, employees, agents and other
                  representatives and their successor and assigns (collectively,
                  the "Seller Group"), for injury to or death of persons, or
                  damage to property, arising in any way from the exercise of
                  rights granted to Buyer under this Section 6.2 hereof, or the
                  activities of Buyer or its employees, agents or contractors on
                  the Assets pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof. BUYER SHALL
                  INDEMNIFY THE SELLER GROUP AGAINST AND HOLD EACH AND ALL OF
                  SAID INDEMNITEES HARMLESS FROM ANY AND ALL LOSSES WHATSOEVER
                  ARISING OUT OF (I) ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR COMMON LAW LIENS
                  OR OTHER ENCUMBRANCES FOR LABOR OR MATERIALS FURNISHED IN
                  CONNECTION WITH SUCH TESTS, SAMPLINGS, STUDIES OR SURVEYS AS
                  BUYER MAY CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS; AND (II) ANY
                  INJURY TO OR DEATH OF PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OCCURRING
                  IN, ON OR ABOUT THE ASSETS AS A RESULT OF SUCH EXERCISE OR
                  ACTIVITIES UNDER THIS SECTION 6.2.

         (C)      "Environmental Laws" means all applicable local, state, and
                  federal laws, rules, regulations, and orders regulating or
                  otherwise pertaining to: (i) the use, generation, migration,
                  storage, removal, treatment, remedy, discharge, release,
                  transportation, disposal, or cleanup of pollutants,
                  contamination, hazardous wastes, hazardous substances,
                  hazardous materials, toxic substances or toxic pollutants;
                  (ii) surface waters, ground waters, ambient air and any other
                  environmental medium on or off any Lease; or (iii) the
                  environment or health and safety-related matters; including
                  the following as from time to time amended and all others
                  whether similar or dissimilar: the Comprehensive Environmental
                  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
                  by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986,
                  the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended
                  by the Used Oil



                                       17

<PAGE>

                  Recycling Act of 1980, the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments
                  of 1980, and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984,
                  the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended, the
                  Toxic Substance Control Act, as amended, the Clean Air Act, as
                  amended, the Clean Water Act, as amended, and all regulations
                  promulgated pursuant thereto.

6.3      Notice of Adverse Environmental Conditions. No later than July 17,
         2003, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any Adverse Environmental
         Condition with respect to the Assets. Such notice shall describe in
         reasonable detail the Adverse Environmental Condition and include the
         estimated Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto (the
         "Environmental Defect Notice"). Buyer shall not send such a notice to
         Seller unless (i) the Environmental Defect Value exceeds Fifty Thousand
         Dollars ($50,000.00) in each individual case; and (ii) the aggregate
         Environmental Defect Values of all Adverse Environmental Conditions
         satisfying the condition in clause (i) exceeds one and one-half percent
         1-1/2%) of the Base Purchase Price (the "Environmental Defect Hurdle
         Rate"). The "Environmental Defect Value" attributable to any Adverse
         Environmental Condition shall be the estimated amount (net of Seller's
         interest) of all reasonable costs and claims associated with the
         existence, Remediation or correction of the Adverse Environmental
         Conditions, as reasonably determined and estimated by Buyer. The term
         "Adverse Environmental Condition" means (i) the failure of the Assets
         to be in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) the
         Assets being subject to any agreements, consent orders, decrees or
         judgments currently in existence based on any Environmental Laws that
         negatively impact the future use of any portion of the Assets or that
         require any change in the present conditions of any of the Assets; or
         (iii) the Assets being subject to any uncured notices of violations of
         or non-compliance with any applicable Environmental Laws. Subject to
         the other provisions of this Agreement, (a) Buyer also shall be deemed
         to have conclusively waived any rights under this Article 6 for all
         Adverse Environmental Conditions not disclosed to Seller before July
         17, 2003 and (b) Buyer waives any remedy against Seller of any rights
         under this Article 6 for Adverse Environmental Conditions that do not
         exceed the Environmental Defect Hurdle Rate; provided, however, once
         such amount exceeds the Environmental Defect Hurdle Rate, Buyer shall
         be entitled to recover all amounts to which it is entitled in excess of
         the Environmental Defect Hurdle Rate.

6.4      Rights and Remedies for Adverse Environmental Conditions.

         (A)      With respect to any Adverse Environmental Conditions affecting
                  one or more of the Assets which exceed the Environmental
                  Defect Hurdle Rate, Seller may on an Asset by Asset basis
                  either (i) Remediate the Adverse Environmental Conditions, but
                  Seller shall have no obligation to do so ; (ii) in the event
                  the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value for
                  such Asset, Buyer shall have the right to exclude such Asset
                  from this Agreement, in which case Buyer shall reassign the
                  Asset affected thereby to Seller, and Seller shall pay to
                  Buyer an amount equal to the Allocated Value, (net of all
                  revenues received by Buyer less all expenses paid by Buyer),
                  together with Interest on such amounts from the Closing to the
                  date of payment; provided, if Buyer so elects to exclude such
                  Asset, Seller shall have the right to Remediate the Adverse
                  Environmental Condition and such Asset shall be subject to



                                       18

<PAGE>

                  this Agreement; provided, however, that if such Adverse
                  Environmental Condition is not Remediated as of April 17,
                  2004, then the Asset shall be excluded from this Agreement
                  with the same effect as set forth above in this clause (ii)
                  above; (iii) with Buyer's approval, Seller shall indemnify
                  Buyer for the Adverse Environmental Condition and proceed to
                  Closing on the affected Assets without adjusting the Base
                  Purchase Price, provided that Seller shall Remediate the
                  Adverse Environmental Condition by April 17, 2004, and if such
                  Remediation has not occurred by such date, Buyer may elect to
                  exclude the affected Asset from the Agreement, in which case
                  Buyer shall reassign the Asset to Seller with Buyer to receive
                  concurrently therewith the consideration contemplated by
                  clause (ii) above; or (iv) retain the affected Asset and
                  reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the
                  affected Asset.

         (B)      Subject to the provisions of Section 14.1 below, Buyer waives
                  any Adverse Environmental Condition for which Buyer has
                  received an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price in
                  accordance with Section 6.4(A).

         (C)      If the aggregate value of the Adverse Environmental Conditions
                  (other than those (i) Remediated, (ii) for which the Base
                  Purchase Price is adjusted, (iii) for which Buyer is
                  indemnified or (iv) which are retained and thereby cause a
                  reduction in the Base Purchase Price) equals or exceeds
                  twenty-five percent (25%) of the Base Purchase Price, either
                  Party may terminate this Agreement and neither Party shall
                  have any further obligation to conclude the transfer of the
                  Assets under this Agreement.

         (D)      The term "Remediate" means, with respect to any valid Adverse
                  Environmental Condition, the undertaking and completion of
                  those actions and activities necessary to remediate such
                  Adverse Environmental Condition to the degree sufficient that
                  such Adverse Environmental Condition no longer constitutes an
                  Adverse Environmental Condition as defined above. Seller shall
                  promptly notify Buyer at such time as it believes that it has
                  Remediated an Adverse Environmental Condition. Buyer shall
                  promptly notify Seller whether it agrees such condition is
                  Remediated. If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its
                  determination with respect to such Remediation within thirty
                  (30) days following Seller's notice, such Adverse
                  Environmental Condition shall be deemed Remediated.

         (E)      If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on the amount of the
                  Environmental Defect Value within ten (10) days after Seller's
                  receipt of the Environmental Defect Notice, any proposed
                  Remediation of an Adverse Environmental Condition by Seller or
                  that an Adverse Environmental Condition exists, has been
                  Remediated or is required to be Remediated, then the dispute
                  will be submitted to ENSR or another mutually acceptable
                  company (the "Environmental Consultant") whose determination
                  shall be final and binding upon the Parties and enforceable
                  against any Party in a court of competent jurisdiction. Seller
                  and Buyer shall each bear their respective costs and expenses
                  incurred in connection with any such dispute, and one-half
                  (1/2) of the fees, costs and expenses charged by the
                  Environmental Consultant. Each Party shall present a written
                  statement of its position on the Adverse Environmental
                  Condition and/or the Environmental Defect Value in question to
                  the Environmental Consultant



                                       19

<PAGE>

                  within five (5) days after the Environmental Consultant is
                  selected, and the Environmental Consultant shall make a
                  determination of all points of disagreement in accordance with
                  the terms and conditions of this Agreement within ten (10)
                  business days of receipt of such position statements. Once the
                  Environmental Consultant's determination has been expressed to
                  both Parties, if applicable, Seller shall have five (5) days
                  in which to advise Buyer in writing which of the options
                  available to Seller under Section 6.4(A) Seller elects
                  regarding each of the Assets as to which the Environmental
                  Consultant has made a determination.

6.5      Remediation. Subject to Section 14.1, if Seller elects to Remediate an
         Adverse Environmental Condition or is required by a governmental or
         regulatory agency to Remediate an Adverse Environmental Condition, the
         following will govern the Remediation:

         (A)      Seller shall be responsible for all negotiations and contacts
                  with federal, state, and local agencies and authorities with
                  regard to the Adverse Environmental Condition or Remediation.
                  Buyer may not make any independent contacts with any agency,
                  authority, or other third party with respect to the Adverse
                  Environmental Condition or Remediation and shall keep all
                  information regarding the Adverse Environmental Condition and
                  Remediation confidential, except in each instance to the
                  extent required by applicable law.

         (B)      Seller shall Remediate the Adverse Environmental Condition to
                  the level agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (or failing such
                  agreement to the level determined by the Environmental
                  Consultant), but in no event shall Seller be required to
                  Remediate the Adverse Environmental Condition beyond the level
                  required by the Environmental Laws in effect at the Effective
                  Time.

         (C)      Buyer shall grant and warrant reasonable access and entry to
                  the Assets after Closing to Seller and third parties
                  conducting assessments or Remediation, to the extent and as
                  long as necessary to conduct and complete the assessment or
                  Remediation work, to remove equipment and facilities, and to
                  perform any other activities reasonably necessary in
                  connection with assessment or Remediation.

         (D)      Buyer shall use its reasonable commercial efforts not to
                  interfere with Seller's ingress and egress or assessment or
                  Remediation activities. Seller shall make reasonable efforts
                  to perform the work so as to minimize disruption to Buyer's
                  business activities. Seller waives and releases all claims
                  against Buyer, its parent and subsidiary companies, and each
                  of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
                  other representatives and their successor and assigns
                  (collectively, the "Buyer Group"), for injury to or death of
                  persons, or damage to property, arising in any way from
                  Seller's access to the Assets pursuant to this Section 6.5
                  hereof, or the activities of Seller or its employees, agents
                  or contractors on the Assets pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof.

         (E)      Seller shall continue Remediation of the Adverse Environmental
                  Condition until the first of the following occurs:

                  (i)      the appropriate governmental authorities provide
                           notice to Seller or Buyer that no further Remediation
                           of the Adverse Environmental Condition is required;
                           or

                  (ii)     the Adverse Environmental Condition has been
                           Remediated to the level required by the Environmental
                           Laws or as agreed by the Parties.

                  Upon the occurrence of either (i) or (ii) above, Seller shall
                  notify Buyer that Remediation of the Adverse Environmental
                  Condition is complete and provide a copy of the notification
                  described in (i) above, if applicable. Upon completion of the
                  Remediation and delivery of said notice, but subject to
                  Section 14.1, Seller shall be released from all liability and
                  have no further obligations under any provisions of this
                  Agreement in connection with such Adverse Environmental
                  Condition.

         (F)      Until Seller completes Remediation of an Adverse Environmental
                  Condition, Seller and Buyer shall each notify the other of any
                  pending or threatened claim, action, or proceeding by any
                  authority or private party that relates to or would affect the
                  environmental condition, the assessment, or the Remediation of
                  the Assets.

         (G)      After delivery of possession of the Assets or Closing
                  (whichever occurs first) and before Seller has completed
                  Remediation of an Adverse Environmental Condition, if a leak,
                  spill, or discharge of any material or substance occurs on the
                  Assets ("Occurrence"), which is not caused solely by Seller,
                  Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and act promptly to
                  minimize the effects of the Occurrence. If a spill, leak or
                  discharge occurs and Seller determines that it may affect the
                  area where Seller is conducting Remediation or assessment,
                  Seller shall pay Buyer the cost that would have been incurred
                  by Seller to complete the Remediation but for the Occurrence
                  as agreed by the Parties (or as determined pursuant to Section
                  6.4). As consideration for this payment, Buyer shall accept
                  the environmental condition of the Assets as they exist on the
                  date of the payment, assume full responsibility for
                  Remediating the Assets and related off-site contamination in
                  accordance with this Agreement, and agree to release, not to
                  sue, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Seller as to claims
                  and liabilities arising from the Occurrence.

         (H)      If Seller undertakes Remediation as to any Assets in which
                  Seller's ownership was less than one hundred percent (100%),
                  Buyer shall bill, on behalf of Seller, the other working
                  interest owners for their share of the Remediation expenses.
                  If Buyer recoups any amount from the other working interest
                  owners, Buyer shall pay to Seller, within sixty (60) days of
                  receipt any amounts recouped by Buyer.

                  arrangements, buydowns, buyouts for Oil and Gas, or storage of
                  the same relating to the Assets which Buyer shall be obligated

                  ownership, operation or environmental condition of the Assets
                  that would have a material adverse affect upon the Assets.
                  Buyer shall assume no liability or



                                       22

<PAGE>

                  obligation whatsoever (and Seller shall indemnify and hold
                  Buyer harmless) with respect to the litigation set forth on
                  Exhibit 7.1(F) that accrue to periods prior to the Effective
                  Time (the "Retained Litigation").

         (G)      Permits and Consents. To Seller's knowledge, with respect to
                  Assets, Seller (i) has acquired all material permits,
                  licenses, approvals and consents from appropriate governmental
                  bodies, authorities and agencies to conduct operations on the

                  liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokers' or finders'
                  fees in respect of the matters provided for in this Agreement
                  and Buyer shall have no responsibility therefore.

         (I)      Taxes. Except as set forth in Exhibit 7.1(I), (i) Seller has

                  that are due, (ii) all Taxes (with respect to the Assets)
                  shown to be due on such returns have been paid, (iii) there is

                  authority in writing, and (iv) there are no liens for Taxes on
                  the Assets (except for Taxes which are not yet due or are

                  whatsoever, including any interest, penalty or addition
                  thereto, whether disputed or not.

         (J)      No Bankruptcy. There are no bankruptcy proceedings pending,
                  being contemplated by, or to Seller's knowledge, based upon
                  reasonable inquiry and investigation, threatened against
                  Seller.

         (K)      Agreements. All of the material agreements (the "Material
                  Agreements") (excluding Leases) pertaining to the Assets are
                  listed on Exhibit 7.1(K) and Seller is not in material default
                  with regard to its obligations in any Material Agreement.

         (L)      Prepayments. There are no agreements involving any prepayments
                  for production or any agreements containing a "take or pay"

                                       23

<PAGE>

                  rights with respect to the Assets or to the production
                  therefrom.

         (N)      Preferential Rights to Purchase. Except as set forth on
                  Exhibit 7.1(N), there are no preferential rights to purchase
                  the Assets.

         (O)      Compliance With Laws. To Seller's knowledge, with respect to
                  the Assets, Seller has not received any notices of material
                  violations of applicable laws. There are no proceedings,
                  pending or threatened, challenging or seeking revocation or
                  limitation of any permits, licenses, approvals and consents
                  from appropriate governmental bodies, authorities and agencies
                  necessary to conduct operations on the Assets in compliance
                  with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, ordinances and
                  orders.

         (P)      Environmental. To Seller's knowledge, the Assets have been

                  CONSULTATION WITH AN ATTORNEY OF ITS SELECTION, BUYER CONSENTS
                  TO THIS WAIVER.

8.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER.

8.1      Buyer's Representations and Warranties. Buyer represents and warrants
         (which representations and warranties shall survive the Closing) as
         follows:

         (A)      Status of Incorporation. Buyer is a corporation duly
                  incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
                  laws of the State of Nevada.

         (B)      Corporate Authority. Buyer has the corporate power and
                  authority to enter into this Agreement, to carry out the
                  transactions contemplated hereby and to undertake all of the
                  obligations of Buyer set out in this Agreement.

         (C)      Validity of Obligations. The execution, delivery and
                  performance of this Agreement and the performance of the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not in any
                  respect violate, nor be in conflict with any provision of
                  Buyer's charter, by-laws or other governing documents, or any
                  agreement or instrument to which Buyer is a party or is bound,
                  or any judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation
                  applicable to Buyer (subject to governmental consents and
                  approvals customarily obtained after the Closing). This
                  Agreement constitutes legal, valid and bonding obligations of
                  Buyer, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

         (D)      Qualification and Bonding. At Closing, Buyer will be in
                  compliance with the bonding and liability insurance
                  requirements in accordance with all applicable state or
                  federal laws or regulations and that it is and henceforth will
                  continue to be qualified to own any federal, Indian or state
                  oil and gas leases that constitute part of the Assets.

         (E)      Financing. At Closing, Buyer will have sufficient cash to
                  enable it to pay the Purchase Price to Seller.

         (F)      Broker's Fees. Buyer has incurred no obligation or liability,
                  contingent or otherwise, for brokers' or finders' fees in
                  respect of the matters provided for in this Agreement, and, if
                  any such obligation or liability exists, it shall remain an
                  obligation of Buyer, and Seller shall have no responsibility
                  therefore.



                                       26

         (G)      No Knowledge of Sellers' Breach. As of the execution of this
                  Agreement, Buyer has no knowledge of any breach by Seller of
                  any representation or warranty of Seller, or of any other
                  fact, event, condition or circumstance that would excuse Buyer
                  from the timely performance of its obligations hereunder.

9.       CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF SELLER. Seller agrees and covenants that, unless
         Buyer shall have otherwise agreed in writing, the following provisions
         shall apply:

9.1      Maintenance of Assets. From the date of this Agreement until Closing,
         Seller agrees that, for those Wells which Seller operates, it shall:

         (A)      Administer and operate the Wells in accordance with the
                  applicable operating agreements and all applicable laws in all
                  material respects.

         (B)      Not introduce any new methods of management, operation or

         (C)      Use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and keep the
                  Assets in full force and effect; and fulfill all contractual
                  or other covenants, obligations and conditions imposed upon
                  Seller with respect to the Assets, including, but not limited
                  to, payment of royalties, delay rentals, shut-in gas royalties
                  and any and all other required payments.

         (D)      Except to the extent necessary or advisable to avoid
                  forfeiture or penalties, not enter into agreements to drill
                  new wells or to rework, plug back, deepen, plug or abandon any
                  Well, nor commence any drilling, reworking or completing or
                  other operations on the Leases which requires expenditures
                  exceeding One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) (net to
                  Seller's interest) for each operation (except for emergency
                  operations and operations required under presently existing
                  contractual obligations) without obtaining the prior written
                  consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
                  withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that the terms of
                  this paragraph (D) shall not apply to any expenditures of
                  Seller which will not be charged to Buyer.

         (E)      Not voluntarily relinquish its position as operator to anyone
                  other than Buyer with respect to any of the Wells or
                  voluntarily abandon any of the Wells other than as required
                  pursuant to the terms of a Lease or by regulation.

         (F)      Not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent
                  shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
                  (i) enter into any agreement or arrangement (other than one
                  constituting a Permitted Encumbrance) transferring, selling or
                  encumbering any of the Assets (other than in the ordinary
                  course of business, consistent with past practices, including
                  ordinary course sales of production, inventory or salvage, or
                  with respect to any Assets with a value less than One Hundred
                  Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) or pursuant to any Material
                  Agreement;



                                       27

<PAGE>

                  (ii) grant any preferential or other right to purchase or
                  agree to require the consent of any party not otherwise
                  required to consent to the transfer and assignment of the
                  Assets to Buyer; (iii) enter into any new sales contracts or
                  supply contracts other than those based on spot market pricing
                  which cannot be cancelled upon thirty (30) days prior notice;
                  or (iv) incur or agree to incur any contractual obligation or
                  liability (absolute or contingent) with respect to the Assets
                  except as otherwise provided herein (including ordinary course
                  sales of production, inventory or salvage or with respect to
                  any Assets with a value less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
                  ($100,000.00) or pursuant to any disclosed AFEs covering the
                  Assets).

         (G)      To the extent known to Seller, provide Buyer with written
                  notice of (i) any claims, demands, suits or actions made
                  against Seller which materially affect the Assets affected
                  thereby; or (ii) any proposal from a third party to engage in
                  any material transaction (e.g., a farmout) with respect to the
                  Assets.

9.2      Consents. Seller shall exercise reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
         all such permissions, approvals and consents by governmental
         authorities and others which are required to vest good and marketable
         title to the Assets in Buyer or as may be otherwise reasonably
         requested by Buyer. Seller is aware that certain Consents may not be
         obtained by Closing. Seller will execute all necessary or appropriate
         transfer orders (or letters in lieu thereof) designating Buyer as the
         appropriate party for payment effective as of the Effective Time. Any
         failure to obtain such permissions, approvals and consents that are
         required to vest good and marketable title to the Assets (other than as
         provided for in Article 5) shall be deemed a Title Defect and the
         procedures set forth in Section 5.5 shall apply.

9.3      Preferential Rights.

         (A)      Seller agrees that it will (i) use reasonable efforts,
                  consistent with industry practices in transactions of this
                  type, to identify all preferential rights to purchase
                  ("Preferential Rights") applicable to the transaction
                  contemplated hereby, and the names and addresses of such
                  parties holding the same, and (ii) request, from the parties
                  so identified (and in accordance with the documents creating
                  such rights), execution of waivers of Preferential Rights.

         (B)      If the holder of a Preferential Right exercises such right,
                  Seller shall tender to such party the required interest in the
                  affected Asset at a price equal to the Allocated Value
                  (reduced appropriately, as determined by mutual agreement of
                  Buyer and Seller, if less than the entire Asset must be
                  tendered), and to the extent that such Preferential Right is
                  exercised and such interest in such Asset is actually sold to
                  the party so exercising such right, such interest in the Asset
                  will be deemed an Excluded Asset and shall be excluded from
                  the transaction contemplated hereby and the Base Purchase
                  Price will be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value.

         (C)      If, on the Closing Date, the holder of a Preferential Right
                  has not indicated whether or not it will exercise such
                  Preferential Right and the time period within which the holder
                  of the Preferential Right must exercise its right has not
                  lapsed, then the Parties



                                       28


<PAGE>

                  shall proceed with Closing on those Assets affected by the
                  Preferential Right and Buyer shall assume the responsibility
                  for conveying the Assets to the holder of the Preferential
                  Right should the holder timely exercise its Preferential Right
                  and shall be entitled to receive all consideration payable
                  with respect thereto. BUYER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND
                  HOLD HARMLESS SELLER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES
                  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BUYER'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH
                  THE TERMS OF SUCH PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS.

9.4      Hart-Scott-Rodino. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in preparing and
         submitting, in a timely manner, all filings, if required, for Buyer in
         connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
         the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR
         Act") and the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission
         thereunder. Buyer will bear the cost of the HSR Act filing fee made in
         accordance with this Section 9.4 and Section 10.4.

9.5      Records and Contracts. Seller shall have the right to make and retain
         copies of the Records and Contracts as Seller may desire prior to the
         delivery of the Records and Contracts to Buyer. Buyer, for a period of
         five (5) years after the Closing Date, shall make available to Seller
         (at the location of such Records and Contracts in Buyer's organization)
         access to such Records and Contracts as Buyer may have in its
         possession (or to which it may have access) upon written request of
         Seller, during normal business hours; provided, however, that Buyer
         shall not be liable to Seller for the loss of any Records or Contracts
         by reason of clerical error or inadvertent loss or destruction of
         Records or Contracts.

9.6      Operator Assistance. Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts as
         requested by Buyer to assist Buyer in assuming operatorship of the
         Assets.

10.      CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF BUYER. Buyer agrees and covenants that unless
         Seller shall have consented otherwise in writing, the following
         provisions shall apply:

         liability for the necessary and proper plugging and abandonment of all
         unplugged Wells, which are identified on Exhibit 1.1(A-2).

10.2     Plugging Bond. Buyer shall post, prior to Closing, the necessary bonds
         or letters of credit as required by the state in which the Leases are
         located for the plugging of all Wells, and provide Seller with a copy
         of same, and provide proof satisfactory to Seller that the applicable
         state has accepted such bonds or letters of credit as sufficient
         assurance to cover the plugging of all Wells and related matters.
         Further, Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of the approval by any
         applicable regulatory agencies concerning change of operatorship of the
         Wells.

         warranty with respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise
         to the claim and the alleged basis for the claim, and the amount (to
         the extent then determinable) of liability for which indemnity is
         asserted. In the event any action, suit or proceeding is brought with
         respect to which a Party may be liable under this Article 14, the
         defense of the action, suit or proceeding (including all settlement
         negotiations and arbitration, trial, appeal, or other proceeding) shall
         be at the discretion of and conducted by the indemnifying Party. An
         indemnified Party shall have the right to be represented by its own
         counsel at its own expense in any such action, suit or proceeding, and
         if an indemnified Party is named as the defendant in any action, suit
         or proceeding, it shall be entitled to have its own counsel and defend
         such action, suit or proceeding with respect to itself at its own
         expense. Should the indemnifying Party not undertake the defense of
         such matter, the indemnified Party may elect to defend such matter as
         it deems proper, and under such circumstances shall be entitled to
         settle and



                                       35

<PAGE>

         compromise any such matter as it may deem reasonable under the
         circumstances and such settlement and compromise shall be binding on
         the indemnifying Party. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this
         Article 14, including the provisions in the preceding sentence, neither
         Party shall, without the other Party's written consent, settle,
         compromise, confess judgment or permit judgment by default in any
         action, suit or proceeding if such action would create or attach any
         liability or obligation to the other Party. The Parties agree to make
         available to each other, and to their respective counsel and
         accountants, all information and documents reasonably available to them
         which relate to any action, suit or proceeding, and the Parties agree
         to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require
         of each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any
         such action, suit or proceeding.

15.      MISCELLANEOUS.

15.1     Casualty Loss.

         (A)      An event of casualty means volcanic eruptions, acts of God,
                  terrorist action, fire, explosion, earthquake, wind storm,
                  flood, drought, condemnation, the exercise of any right of
                  eminent domain, confiscation and seizure (a "Casualty"). A
                  Casualty does not include depletion due to normal production
                  and depreciation or failure of equipment or casing.

         (B)      If, prior to Closing, a Casualty occurs (or Casualties occur)
                  which results in a reduction in the value of the Assets in
                  excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price
                  ("Casualty Loss"), Buyer or Seller may elect to terminate this
                  Agreement. If this Agreement is not so terminated, then this
                  Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
                  notwithstanding any such Casualty Loss, and, upon agreement of
                  the Parties, (i) Seller may retain such Asset and such Asset
                  shall be the subject of an adjustment to the Base Purchase
                  Price in the same manner set forth in Section 5.5 hereof, or
                  (ii) at the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer all sums paid
                  to Seller by reason of such Casualty Loss; provided, however,
                  that the Base Purchase Price shall not be adjusted by reason
                  of such payment, and Seller shall assign, transfer and set
                  over unto Buyer all of the right, title and interest of Seller
                  in and to such Asset and any unpaid awards or other payments
                  arising out of such Casualty Loss.

         (C)      For purposes of determining the diminution in value of an
                  Asset as a result of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall use
                  the same methodology as applied in determining the diminution
                  in value of an Asset as a result of a Title Defect as set
                  forth in Section 5, but such adjustment shall be made at the
                  Closing rather than in the time period set forth in such
                  Section 5.5.

15.2     Confidentiality.

         (A)      Prior to Closing, to the extent not already public, Buyer
                  shall exercise all due diligence in safeguarding and
                  maintaining secure all engineering, geological and geophysical
                  data, seismic data, reports and maps, the results and findings
                  of Buyer with regard to



                                       36

<PAGE>

                  its due diligence associated with the Assets (including
                  without limitation with regard to due diligence associated
                  with environmental and title matters) and other data relating
                  to the Assets (collectively, the "Confidential Information").
                  Buyer acknowledges that, prior to Closing, all Confidential
                  Information shall be treated as confidential and shall not be
                  disclosed to third parties without the prior written consent
                  of Seller .

         (B)      In the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason,
                  Buyer shall not use or knowingly permit others to use such
                  Confidential Information in a manner detrimental to Seller,
                  and will not disclose any such Confidential Information to any
                  person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any
                  reason or purpose whatsoever, except to Seller or to a
                  governmental agency pursuant to a valid subpoena or other
                  order or pursuant to applicable governmental regulations,
                  rules or statutes.

         (C)      The undertaking of confidentiality shall not diminish or take
                  precedence over any separate confidentiality agreement between
                  the Parties. Should this Agreement terminate, such separate
                  confidentiality agreement shall remain in full force and
                  effect.

         (D)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may disclose financial
                  information (including pro forma financial information) with
                  respect to the Assets if required by law or listing
                  requirements (including in connection with the issuance of
                  securities).

15.3     Competition. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may presently own interests
         or have leads, prospects, information or ideas on properties or
         leaseholds adjacent to, adjoining or in the vicinity of the Assets.
         Seller shall not be prohibited in any way from competing with Buyer or
         pursuing any activity or business opportunity on property not being
         transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

15.4     Notice. Any notice, request, demand, or consent required or permitted
         to be given hereunder shall be in writing and delivered in person or by
         certified letter, with return receipt requested or by prepaid overnight
         delivery service, or by facsimile addressed to the Party for whom
         intended at the following addresses:

                  or at such other address as any of the above shall specify by
                  like notice to the other.

15.5     Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any press
         release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
         of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written
         approval of the other Party; provided, however, that any Party may make
         any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by
         applicable law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its or
         its affiliates' publicly-traded securities (in which case the
         disclosing Party shall use all reasonable efforts to advise the other
         Party, and give the other Party an opportunity to comment on the
         proposed disclosure, prior to making the disclosure).

15.6     Employees.

         (A)      Buyer shall offer employment to the employees set forth on
                  Exhibit 15.6(A-1), such employment to commence on the day
                  after the Closing Date. Buyer also has the option (but no
                  obligation) to offer employment to the employees set forth in
                  Exhibit 15.6(A-2). All such employees accepting such offer
                  (the "Employees") shall be retained by Buyer for a period of
                  at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, unless
                  the employee earlier resigns or is terminated for cause (in
                  which event such terminated Employee shall receive no
                  severance package). In the event Buyer terminates an Employee
                  without cause prior to the end of such twelve (12) month
                  period, Buyer shall give such Employee a one (1) year
                  severance package from the date of such termination.

         (B)      All Employees shall receive a base salary or hourly wage at
                  least equal to his or her base salary or hourly wage level in
                  effect on the Closing Date.

         (C)      Buyer shall extend, on the day after the Closing Date, Buyer's
                  then-existing employee benefit plans to all the Employees to
                  the extent that such employees would otherwise be eligible to
                  participate in such plans, such eligibility to be determined
                  as set forth in the following sentence. For all purposes of
                  extending benefit plans of Buyer following the Closing Date to
                  any Employee: (i) service with the Seller or its affiliates by
                  such Employee prior to the Closing Date shall be credited for
                  eligibility and vesting purposes, and for purposes of
                  qualifying for additional benefits or contribution levels
                  based on periods of service under any such plans, but not for
                  benefit accrual purposes, and (ii) with respect to any benefit
                  plans in which such Employee may participate, Buyer shall use
                  reasonable efforts to cause such plans to provide credit for
                  any



                                       38

<PAGE>

                  co-payments or deductibles by such Employee and waive all
                  pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods, other
                  than limitations or waiting periods that have not been
                  satisfied under applicable benefit plans maintained by Seller
                  for such Employees prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall
                  provide vacation and sick leave days to Employees on a
                  pro-rated basis for the remaining portion of 2002 and for
                  future years based on Buyer's applicable plan, but recognizing
                  in such determination service with Seller or its affiliates
                  prior to the Closing Date.

         (D)      As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all liabilities and
                  obligations relating to any Employee that relate to the period
                  of time following the Closing Date and shall indemnify Seller,
                  against any and all losses, costs, expenses (including court
                  costs, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and experts
                  and costs of investigation), liabilities, damages, demands,
                  suits, claims and sanctions of every kind and character
                  (including civil fines) arising from, related to or reasonably
                  incident to matters indemnified against in this section.

         (E)      Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations relating
                  to any Employee that relate to the period of time prior to the
                  Closing Date and shall indemnify Buyer against any and all
                  losses, costs, expenses (including court costs, reasonable
                  fees and expenses of attorneys and experts and costs of
                  investigation, liabilities, damages, demands, suits, claims
                  and sanctions of every kind and character (including civil
                  fines) arising from, related to or reasonably incident to
                  matters indemnified against in this section.

         (F)      Except for those Employees set forth in Exhibit 15.6(A-1) and
                  (A-2), Buyer shall not for a period of eighteen (18) months,
                  without the prior written consent of Seller, directly or
                  indirectly solicit for employment any person who is now
                  employed by Seller or its affiliates involved in the
                  exploration and production business in an executive,
                  management, technical or professional position or otherwise
                  considered by Seller to by a key employee; provided, however,
                  notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may hire such employees
                  who contact the Buyer for employment as a result of general
                  advertising by Buyer.

15.7     COMPLIANCE WITH EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE TEST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE
         INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL BE WITHOUT
         REGARD TO THE NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNIFIED
         PERSON(S), WHETHER THE NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY IS ACTIVE,
         PASSIVE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR SOLE.

15.8     Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and must be construed
         according to the laws of the State of Utah, excluding any
         conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might apply the law of another
         jurisdiction. All disputes related to this Agreement shall be submitted
         to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Utah and venue shall
         be in the civil district courts of Salt Lake City, Utah.

15.9     Exhibits. The Exhibits attached to this Agreement are incorporated into
         and made a part of this Agreement.

         (A)      Each Party shall be solely responsible for all costs and
                  expenses incurred by it in connection with this transaction
                  (including, but not limited to fees and expenses of its
                  counsel and accountants) and shall not be entitled to any
                  reimbursements from the other Party, except as otherwise
                  provided in this Agreement.

         (B)      Buyer shall file all necessary Tax returns and other
                  documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary,
                  sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and
                  fees, and, if required by applicable law, Seller shall join in
                  the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation.
                  Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the
                  contrary, Buyer shall pay any transfer, documentary, sales,
                  use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees
                  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
                  transactions contemplated hereby.

         (C)      Buyer shall, at its own cost, promptly record all instruments
                  of conveyance and sale in the appropriate office of the state
                  and county in which the lands covered by such instrument are
                  located. Buyer shall promptly file for and obtain the
                  necessary approval of all federal, Indian, tribal or state
                  government agencies to the assignment of the Assets. The
                  assignment of any state, federal or Indian tribal oil and gas
                  leases shall be filed in the appropriate governmental offices
                  on a form required and in compliance with the applicable rules

15.11    Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any part hereof may be assigned

         or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to a qualified
         intermediary in connection with any transaction described in Section
         10.5, but no such assignment shall relieve the other Party from any of
         its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement. This Agreement
         shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named
