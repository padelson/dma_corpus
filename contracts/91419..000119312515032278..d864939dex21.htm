Share Cash Amount payable in respect of the cancelation of such holders
Restricted Stock Award and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount
exceeds the Per Share Cash Amount payable in respect of the cancelation of

and who shall have properly demanded and are entitled to appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration. Such stockholders
instead shall only be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
waived, withdrawn, or otherwise are not entitled to, the right to appraisal of
such shares of Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been canceled and converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration upon

give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for
shares of Common Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the

and proceedings with respect to any such demands and (iii) not, without the

Agent to pay from the Exchange Fund to each other Common Stockholder and
holder of a Restricted Stock Award (who has thereafter surrendered
its Certificates, if applicable, and delivered a properly completed

 



-26-  and duly executed Letter of Transmittal) the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration for each share of Common Stock held by such Common Stockholder
and the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration (less the Applicable
Withholding Amount) for each share of Common Stock underlying such Restricted
Stock Award, in each case in accordance with the procedures set forth herein,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay (i) to the Surviving Company

applicable withholding Taxes and (ii) to the Surviving Company for payment to
each holder of Options who is a Non-Accredited Holder, cash in an amount equal

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash with an
aggregate value equal to the Excluded Restricted Stock Award Consideration
Amount (in each case valuing the Parent Common Stock based on the Closing
Parent Common Stock Price) shall be withheld from the amount payable to the
Common Stockholders, holders of Restricted Stock Awards and holders of
Options at any time in accordance with the remainder of this _Section 2.9(a)_
(the " _Excluded Restricted Stock Award Holdback_ "). The amount of cash
and/or shares of Parent Common Stock withheld from each Common Stockholder,
each holder of a Restricted Stock Award and each holder of Options shall be
equal to the difference between the amount of cash and/or shares of Parent
Common Stock payable to each such holder in accordance with this _Section
2.9(a)_ and the amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock that would
have been payable to such holder in accordance with this _Section 2.9(a)_ had
the Fully-Diluted Outstanding Stock included the Excluded Restricted Stock
Award, for each holder in the same proportion of cash to shares of Parent
Common Stock (and in the case of Cashed-Out Options, solely in the form of
cash) as such holder would have been entitled to receive prior to giving
effect to the withholding described in this and the preceding sentence (such
aggregate amount of withheld cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, the "
_Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property_ "), which Excluded
Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property shall have an aggregate value equal to
the Excluded Restricted Stock Award Consideration Amount (in each case valuing
the Parent Common Stock based on the Closing Parent Common Stock Price). The
Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property shall be held by the
Stockholder Representative or, at the Stockholder Representatives option, by
a third party or other entity controlled by the Stockholder Representative
(the Stockholder Representative or such third party or other entity, in such
capacity, the " _Escrow Property Agent_ ") and shall be disbursed in
accordance with the Vesting Agreement. In the event, pursuant to the terms of
the Vesting Agreement, the Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property
becomes available for distribution to the Common Stockholders, holders of
Restricted Stock Awards and holders of Options, the Escrow Property Agent
(with the cooperation of Parent as set forth in the last sentence of _Section
2.7(f)_) shall return such Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property to
the Common Stockholders, holders of Restricted Stock Awards and holders of
Options in the amounts and in the form (whether cash or a combination of cash
and Parent Common Stock) withheld from such holders pursuant to the Excluded
Restricted Stock Award Holdback (and for the avoidance of doubt, neither
Parent nor the Company shall have any liability whatsoever related to or
arising out of such distribution by the Escrow Property Agent).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including _Section
2.7_, to the extent the Excluded Restricted Stock Award

 



-27-  Escrow Property is disbursed to the holders of Excluded Restricted Stock
Awards in accordance with the Vesting Agreement, no Common Stockholder, holder
of Restricted Stock Awards or holder of Options shall have any rights with
respect thereto or be entitled to any consideration in respect thereof, and
the Excluded Restricted Stock Award Consideration Amount, to the extent
disbursed to the holders of Excluded Restricted Stock Awards in accordance
with the Vesting Agreement, shall be deemed a reduction to the aggregate cash
consideration and/or the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be paid and issued to Common Stockholders, holders of Restricted Stock Awards
and holders of Options pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Escrow Property Agent shall have sole discretion (subject to the
Vesting Agreement) to determine when Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property
shall become available for distribution to the holder of an Excluded
Restricted Stock Award or to the Common Stockholders, holders of Restricted
Stock Awards and holders of Options, in each case in accordance with the
Vesting Agreement, and neither Parent nor the Company shall have any
liability whatsoever related to or arising out of such determination.

(b) The following provisions shall be applicable to payment of the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration and Non-Accredited Option Aggregate
Consideration:

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will deliver or mail or will
cause to be delivered or mailed to each Equityholder a letter of transmittal
in a form prepared by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, only upon proper delivery of the related Certificates (or, for
holders of uncertificated shares or Options, upon proper delivery of a fully
executed Letter of Transmittal) in accordance therewith to the Company or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, and instructions for use in surrendering
such shares of Common Stock and receiving the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the Common Stock evidenced thereby or by such
Restricted Stock Award (less any applicable withholdings). Upon the surrender
of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall, on the Closing Date, pay the holder of
such shares of Common Stock the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
and the holder of such Restricted Stock Award the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration (less the Applicable Withholding Amount), in
consideration therefor, and such shares of Common Stock (including those
underlying any such Restricted Stock Award) and any related Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled and the Surviving Company shall, within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time, subject to the delivery of a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, or as soon as
reasonably practicable after such delivery, pay the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration or cash (less Applicable Withholding Amount), as
applicable, in respect of the Options in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_.
Upon the surrender of each such Certificate, if applicable, and a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal any time after the
date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange
Agent shall, no earlier than at the Closing and as soon as reasonably
practicable, pay the holder of such shares of Common Stock the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration and the holder of a Restricted Stock Award
the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration (less the Applicable
Withholding Amount), in consideration therefor, and such shares of Common

 



-28-  Stock (including those underlying any such Restricted Stock Award) and any
related Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate (other than Certificates representing Canceled Shares,
Continuing Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to
receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding, if any) relating thereto.

 

(ii) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of any shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, shares of Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be surrendered and canceled against delivery of the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

(iii) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration payable upon the delivery of Certificates or Letters of
Transmittal. None of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to a Common Stockholder or
holder of Equity Awards for any cash or interest thereon delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Common
Stockholders or amounts unclaimed by holders of Equity Awards twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any
claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains unclaimed shall, at Parents option, be paid
to Parent.

(iv) After the Effective Time, any Common Stockholders or holder of Equity
Awards will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company for payment of
their respective claims for the consideration set forth in this _Article II_,
without interest thereon, but will have no greater rights against the
Surviving Company than may be accorded to general creditors thereof under
applicable Law.

(v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such Certificate to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_; _provided_ , that the
Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, indemnify Parent and the Surviving Company against any claim
that may be made against Parent, a Merger Sub or the Surviving Company with
respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Exchange
Agent, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such 

 



-29-  payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 

(vii) If payment of the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect
of a share of Common Stock (including those underlying any Restricted Stock
Award) is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
payable.

 

(viii) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or uncertificated shares of
Common Stock or holder of an Equity Award) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment with
respect to any cash portion of Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the
surrender of such Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Common Stock) or
other relevant provisions are followed in accordance with this _Article II_.
Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Common Stock), there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, (1) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(ix)_ and (2) the amount of dividends or other distributions
declared on the shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender that is payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(ix) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Common Stock or Equity Awards
pursuant to this _Article II_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Common Stock or Equity Awards converted
pursuant to the Initial Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Common Stock or the Equity Award exchanged by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional amount _multiplied by_ the Closing Parent Common
Stock Price.

 



-30- (x) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund,
as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of
the Exchange Fund pursuant to this _Section 2.9_.

 

(c) For all purposes of this _Section 2.9_ and for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), a Common Stockholder will be treated as having surrendered,
in exchange for the Aggregate Stockholder Cash Consideration to be paid to
such Common Stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_, a number of shares of
Company Common Stock evidenced by Certificates (which are specifically
identified by such stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal to be the
Certificates exchanged for such stockholders Aggregate Stockholder Cash
Consideration) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such stockholder and converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement and (B) the Cash Ratio.

 

(d) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Estimated
Transaction Expenses which are then unpaid in accordance with the Estimated
Closing Statement.

2.10. _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare in consultation with
Parent, and at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent (A) a good faith calculation of (i) the
estimated amount of the Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working
Capital Amount_ "), (ii) the estimated amount of Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the estimated amount of Closing
Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (iv) the estimated amount of
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), and its good
faith calculation of the Aggregate Base Cash Amount, collectively the ("
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), (B) a list identifying whether each holder
of Options is an Accredited Holder or a Non-Accredited Holder and (C)
instructions specifying the amounts to be paid in respect of the Estimated
Transaction Expenses and the recipients thereof (including wire instructions).
During the preparation by the Company of the Estimated Closing Statement and
after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, Parent and its
representatives shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and to discuss
with the Company and its representatives (a) the Companys and
its Subsidiaries working papers and the working papers of the Companys
independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital Amount,
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated
Transaction Expenses after signing a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement with such independent accountants relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants, as well as (b) the relevant books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; and the Company and its representatives shall
reasonably assist Parent and its representatives in their review of the
Estimated Closing Statement and the preparation thereof and reasonably
cooperate with respect thereto, _provided_ , _that_ , in no event shall the
foregoing rights of Parent delay the Closing Date.

 



-31- (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event
within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, (A) Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") that shall set forth a calculation of (i) the Closing Working
Capital, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing Cash and (iv) the
Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing
Statement shall entirely disregard any financing or refinancing arrangements
entered into at any time by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Stockholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Adjustment Review
Period_ "), the Stockholder Representative and its representatives shall be
permitted to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries working papers and
the working papers of the Companys independent accountants, if any, relating
to the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses
after signing a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating
to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to such independent accountants, as well as the relevant books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent shall cause the Company and its
representatives to assist the Stockholder Representative and its
representatives in their review of the Closing Statement and
reasonably cooperate with respect thereto. The Stockholder Representative
shall notify Parent in writing (the " _Notice of Adjustment Disagreement_ ")
prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period if the Stockholder
Representative disagrees with any portion of the Closing Statement. The
Notice of Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the Stockholder
Representatives adjustments to the Closing Statement with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation. If no Notice of Adjustment Disagreement is
received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of the Adjustment Review
Period, then the Closing Statement and all amounts set forth therein shall be
deemed to have been accepted by the Stockholder Representative and shall
become final and binding upon the parties hereto. During the fifteen (15) days
immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Adjustment Disagreement
(the " _Adjustment Resolution Period_ "), the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement. Any items agreed to by the Stockholder
Representative and Parent in writing, together with any items not disputed or
objected to by the Stockholder Representative in the Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_
". If at the end of the Adjustment Resolution Period the parties have been
unable to resolve any differences they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall refer all matters that remain in dispute with
respect to the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the " _Unresolved Matters_
") to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). In the
event that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to act as
the Independent Accountant, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent, in which event "Independent Accountant"
shall mean such firm. In the event the Stockholder Representative and Parent
are unable to reasonably agree to an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition within fifteen (15) days of
the 

 



-32-  commencement of discussions regarding the identification of such an
independent accountant, with the commencement of such discussions marked by
written notice from one party to the other, the "Independent Accountant"
shall be an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States
of national recognition selected by the mutual agreement of (x) a certified
public accounting firm in the United States appointed by the Stockholder
Representative in its sole discretion and (y) a certified public accounting
firm in the United States appointed by Parent in its sole discretion. Within
thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to the Independent
Accountant, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on the parties hereto, of
the appropriate amount of each of the Unresolved Matters. With respect to
each Unresolved Matter, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either the Stockholder Representative or Parent, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the
Stockholder Representative in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Parent
in the Closing Statement with respect to such Unresolved Matter. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not review any line items
in the Closing Statement or make any determination with respect to any matter
other than the Unresolved Matters. During the review by the Independent
Accountant, Parent and the Company shall each make available to the
Independent Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records
and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant
to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.10(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the independent accountants of Parent or the Company shall
not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants. The costs of the Independent Accountant shall be paid
50% by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the holders of shares of
Common Stock) and 50% by Parent.

(d) The " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Notice
of Adjustment Disagreement is delivered by the Stockholder Representative to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Closing
Statement delivered by Parent to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
_Section 2.10(b)_, (ii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement is delivered by the Stockholder Representative to Parent prior to
the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Closing Statement
delivered by Parent to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to  _Section
2.10(b)_ as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative in writing or (iii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement is delivered by the Stockholder Representative to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period and Parent and the
Stockholder Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth in
such Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the Closing Statement delivered by
Parent to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ as
adjusted by the Independent Accountant to be consistent with the Resolved
Matters and the final determination of the Independent Accountant of the
Unresolved Matters in accordance with _Section 2.10(c)_. The date on which
the Final Closing Statement is finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.10(d)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_ ".

 

(e) As of the Determination Date, the parties shall calculate the Aggregate
Final Cash Amount. The " _Aggregate Final Cash Amount_ " shall mean
$3,900,000,000, _minus_ (A) the Closing Indebtedness as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement, _minus_ (B) the amount of

 



-33-  Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, _minus_
(C) the amount, if any, by which the Target Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Closing Working Capital (as set forth in the Final Closing Statement), _plus_
(D) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital (as set forth in
the Final Closing Statement) exceeds the Target Working Capital Amount, _plus_
(E) the Closing Cash as set forth in the Final Closing Statement, _plus_ (F)
the Tax Benefit Amount, and _minus_ (G) the Stockholder Representative
Holdback Amount. If the Aggregate Final Cash Amount is less than the Aggregate
Base Cash Amount paid at the Closing (such difference, the " _Deficiency
Amount_ "), Parent shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date)
such Deficiency Amount from the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount;
_provided_ , that Parents sole recourse with respect thereto shall be the
Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount (as reduced by the Released Holdback
Amount). If the Aggregate Final Cash Amount is greater than the Aggregate
Base Cash Amount paid at the Closing (such difference, which shall in no event
exceed $27,500,000, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Parent shall promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date) pay by
wire transfer of same day funds to (x) the Exchange Agent in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock and Restricted Stock Awards
the portion of the Excess Amount allocable to the holders of shares of Common
Stock and Restricted Stock Awards, (y) the Company in trust for the benefit of
the holders of the Options the portion of the Excess Amount allocable to the
holders of the Options, and (z) either the Escrow Property Agent (in trust
for the benefit of the holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards) or the
holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards (if then in possession of the
Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property), the portion of the Excess
Amount attributable to the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards, in each of (x),
(y) and (z), calculated taking into account the Excluded Restricted Stock
Awards (including with respect to the calculation of the Fully-Diluted
Outstanding Stock); _provided_ , that the Stockholder Representative shall
have delivered to Parent written instructions stating the portion of the
Excess Amount to be paid to the Exchange Agent, the portion of the Excess
Amount to be paid to the Company and the portion of the Excess Amount to be
paid to the Escrow Property Agent or the holders of the Excluded Restricted
Stock Awards, respectively, and none of the Stockholder Representative, Parent
nor the Company shall have any liability whatsoever related to or arising out
of such allocation to the extent consistent with such written instructions.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately upon Parents delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to
distribute the portion of Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount which is
in excess of the "Deficiency Amount" assuming the Deficiency Amount was
calculated based on the amounts set forth by Parent in the Closing Statement
(such excess, the " _Released Holdback Amount_ ") to (x) the Exchange Agent in
trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock and Restricted
Stock Awards in an amount equal to the portion of the Released Holdback Amount
allocable to the holders of shares of Common Stock and Restricted Stock
Awards, (y) the Company in trust for the benefit of the holders of the
Options in an amount equal to the portion of the Released Holdback Amount
allocable to the holders of the Options and (z) either the Escrow Property
Agent (in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Excluded Restricted
Stock Awards) or the holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards (if then
in possession of the Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property), in an
amount equal to the portion of the Released Holdback Amount allocable in
respect of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards, in each of (x), (y) and (z),
calculated taking into account the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards (including
with respect to the calculation of

 



-34-  the Fully-Diluted Outstanding Stock). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, other than the distribution of the Released Holdback Amount pursuant
to this _Section 2.10(f)_, the Stockholder Representative shall retain and
shall not distribute any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback
Amount prior to the sixth (6th) Business Day after the Determination Date and
the payment of all amounts required to be paid to Parent pursuant to _Section
2.10(e)_ (or such earlier time as all payment obligations of the Stockholder
Representative under _Section 2.10(e)_ are satisfied).

 

2.11. _Certain Adjustments_. If, during the Interim Period (and as permitted
by _Section 5.3_), the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration and the
consideration payable to holders of Options pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_
shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect
such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.11_ shall be
construed to permit Parent to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

2.12. _Conversion of Shares in the Follow-On Merger_. At the effective time of
the Follow-On Merger, by virtue of the Follow-On Merger and without any
action on the part of any party, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Follow-
On Merger shall be converted into and become one limited liability company
interest of the Surviving Company, and each limited liability company interest
in Merger Sub Two issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Follow-On Merger shall remain outstanding as a limited liability
company interest of the Surviving Company.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with, or furnished to,
the SEC after April 28, 2013 and prior to the date hereof (excluding
any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Document in any risk factor
section, any forward-looking disclosure in any section relating to forward-
looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific, predictive
or primarily cautionary in nature other than historical facts included
therein) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (each section or subsection of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation or warranty if specified therein and
any such other representations or warranties where its applicability to,
relevance as an exception to, or disclosure for purposes of, such other
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger Subs as follows:

 

3.1. _Due Incorporation; Capitalization_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and, where such concept is applicable, in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its

 



-35-  incorporation or organization, with all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its respective assets and properties as they are now
being owned, leased and operated and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except, with respect to the Companys Subsidiaries other than the
Operating Subsidiary, where the failure to be so duly organized, validly
existing or in good standing or to have such requisite power and authority
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and, where such concept is applicable, is in good standing
in all jurisdictions in which it is required to be so qualified or in good
standing, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has delivered to Parent complete copies of the Organizational
Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
and as currently in effect, and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any provision of such Organizational Documents in any material
respect.

(b) The entire authorized capital stock of the Company is 1,000,000,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "),
314,899,046 of which are issued and outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement. Of such authorized shares, as of the date of this Agreement, (x)
26,264,141 shares of Common Stock are currently subject to Options, (y)
22,718 shares of Common Stock are currently subject to Restricted Stock
Awards, and (z) 6,171,460 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance
pursuant to future awards under the Benefit Plans. _Section 3.1(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ contains a complete and correct list, as of the
date of this Agreement, of (1) each holder of Common Stock, including the
number of shares of Common Stock held by such holder and (2) each holder of
Equity Awards, specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis (i) the name of each
holder, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each such award,
(iii) the grant date of each such award, (iv) the exercise price for each
Option and (v) the expiration date of each Option. No Option is intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. All of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. Such shares have been issued in compliance with
all applicable state and federal Laws concerning the issuance of securities.
No shares of the Common Stock are subject to or were issued in violation of
the preemptive rights of any stockholder or any purchase option, call option,
right of first refusal, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of
the Company or any agreement to which the Company is a party or otherwise
bound. Except as set forth in this _Section 3.1_ and in _Section 3.1(b)(ii)

Agreement.

 

3.4. _Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) There are no liabilities, debts, claims or obligations of any nature of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether known, unknown, accrued, absolute,

" _Liabilities_ ") of the type required to be disclosed on a balance sheet in
accordance with GAAP, except (i) Liabilities disclosed in  _Section 3.4(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter_, (ii) Liabilities to the extent reflected or
reserved against in the Latest Company Balance Sheet, (iii) Liabilities
incurred since the date of the Latest Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary

the Company Disclosure Letter_, the Company has no assets, liabilities,
debts, claims or obligations of any nature, whether known, unknown, accrued,
absolute, direct or indirect, other than the ownership by the Company of all

(b) Each report, schedule, form, statement and other document (including
exhibits and other information incorporated therein and any amendments or
supplements thereto) required to be furnished or filed by the Operating
Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries with the SEC since April 28, 2013 (such
documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC by the Operating
Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries during such period, including all exhibits and
other information incorporated therein and any amendments or supplements
thereto, collectively referred to as the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") (i) at
the time filed (and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto
filed prior to the date of this Agreement), and, in the case of registration
statements, at the time of effectiveness, complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and (ii) did not at the
time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior
to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment),
and, in the case of registration statements, at the time of effectiveness,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company is not, and has not since April 28, 2013 been,
required to furnish or file any report, schedule, form, statement or other
document with the SEC. Each of the consolidated financial statements included
in the Company SEC Documents (A) complied at the time it was filed as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (B) was

 



-39-  prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form 8-K of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the applicable Subsidiaries of the Company

Company, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets and (iii) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably designed to ensure
that material information required to be disclosed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information required to
be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Operating Subsidiary to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, agreement or arrangement (including any
contract, agreement or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such contract, agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 

(e) Since April 28, 2013, the Operating Subsidiarys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Operating
Subsidiarys auditors and the audit committee of the Operating Subsidiarys
board of directors (i) all known "significant deficiencies" and "material
weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any respect the
Operating Subsidiarys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Operating Subsidiarys internal controls over financial reporting. For
purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material
weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board in Auditing Standard No. 2\.

 



-40- (f) Other than the Operating Subsidiary, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1, 2010 been, subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Agreement (the " _Assets_ "), except for inventory sold following the date of
such financial statements in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, in each case, free and clear of any Lien, except for Permitted
Liens, (ii) any Permitted Liens on the Assets, individually or in the
aggregate, do not materially interfere with the current use of any such Asset
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or materially detract from the value
of any such Asset, and (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts or conditions affecting any Assets that, with or without notice or the
lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere with the use, occupancy or operation of such Assets as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing.

in the Owned Intellectual Property or (2) alleging that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated in any
material respect any Intellectual Property of any third party. To the
Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
using any material Owned Intellectual Property in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in the cancelation or unenforceability of
such Owned Intellectual Property.

Adverse Effect, no current or former employee, consultant or contractor has
any valid claim of ownership, in whole or in part, to any material Owned
Intellectual Property (other than Owned Intellectual Property which is
exclusively licensed by the Company) or derivative works thereof, or has
asserted any such claim of ownership or right. All material Intellectual
Property that is owned (or purported to be owned) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was (i) developed by employees of the Company or its

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has conducted no
operations and incurred no obligations other than those incident to its

Agreement. Merger Sub Two is, and at the effective time of the Follow-On
Merger will be, treated as a "disregarded entity" of Parent for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

4.7.  _Financial Statements_.

required to be disclosed on a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, except
(i) Liabilities disclosed in _Section 4.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure

Latest Parent Balance Sheet, (iii) Liabilities incurred since the date of the
Latest Parent

 



-56-  Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each report, schedule, form, statement and other document (including
exhibits and other information incorporated therein and any amendments or
supplements thereto) required to be furnished or filed by Parent and its
Subsidiaries with the SEC since April 30, 2013 (such documents, together with
any documents filed with the SEC by Parent and its Subsidiaries during such
period, including all exhibits and other information incorporated therein and
any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively referred to as the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ ") (i) at the time filed (and giving effect to any
amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement),
and, in the case of registration statements, at the time of effectiveness,
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of SOX and
the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment), and, in the case of registration
statements, at the time of effectiveness, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents
complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form 8-K of
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods shown (except that the unaudited statements may not
contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-end audit adjustments not
material in nature or amount).

internal accounting controls with respect to their businesses sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) all transactions are executed in

Parent, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by
Parent are reasonably designed to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the reports that they file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of Parent as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of Parent to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



-57- (d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, agreement or arrangement (including any
contract, agreement or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract,
agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
Parents or such Subsidiarys financial statements or other Parent SEC
Documents.

(e) Since April 30, 2013, Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of Parents board of directors (i) all known
"significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any respect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees of Parent who
have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting.

 

(f) Other than Parent, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is, or has at
any time since January 1, 2010 been, subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Subsidiaries or their material assets, (c) there are no settlements or similar
written agreements with any Governmental Authority affecting any of Parent,
its Subsidiaries or their material assets and (d) as of the date hereof,

be taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

and correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date

the amounts or fees, "pricing flex" and economic terms therein redacted)
associated therewith (such commitment letter, including all exhibits
schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments and joinders thereto and the fee
letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments
and joinders thereto, collectively, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources party thereto have committed, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes of

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and (c) pay any fees and expenses or other amounts payable by

made available to the Company a true and correct copy of any waiver or

reasonably request, in each case to the extent that such access and
disclosure would not obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent

unreasonably interfere with the normal course of their businesses or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by their employees of their normal duties or violate any applicable
Law ( _provided_ that each of the Company and Parent, respectively, uses
its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to
provide such access and disclosure); _provided_ , _however_ , that this

not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information
provided by the Company or Parent that is entitled to protection under

under 

 



-64-  applicable Law and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. None of the parties shall
knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken or omit to take any action which
such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents
required pursuant to the Material Contracts in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company in such
efforts. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, nothing
herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company or any of its
Affiliates to make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any third party in
order to obtain the consent or approval of such third party under any Material
Contract or otherwise (unless Parent provides the funds for or reimburses the
Company or such Affiliate for such payment) and the Company and its Affiliates
shall not do or commit to do so without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

(c) (i) The Company and Parent will as soon as practicable but in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice the notification and report forms required for
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) Parent will as soon as practicable
but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof
submit a letter to the Commissioner requesting advance ruling certification
under Section 102 of the Competition Act or, in the alternative, a no-action
letter and a waiver under paragraph 113(c) of the Competition Act in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby and if the Competition Act Approval
has not been obtained within 30 days from when the request was submitted by
Parent, either party may provide written notification to the other party at
any time thereafter of its intention to file a notice under Section 114 of the
Competition Act in which case each party shall file its respective notice to
the Commissioner in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby within
ten (10) Business Days thereafter (or such other period of time that is
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties) unless the Competition Act
Approval has been received before such time, and (iii) subsequent to any
filing made hereunder, Parent and the Company will provide any supplemental
information that may be requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act or the Competition Act, which notification and report forms and
supplemental information will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the Competition Act. Each of Parent and the
Company will promptly furnish to the other (x) all necessary information as
the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any
filing or submission pursuant to the HSR Act or the Competition Act and (y)
copies of all written communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance of any oral communication) with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent or Company can redact discussions of the transaction
value and reasonably designate applicable materials as for review by the
others outside counsel only. The Company will consult with Parent prior to
any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Parent will have the right to have a representative present at any such
meeting to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority and reasonably
practical. Parent will consult with the Company prior to any meetings, by
telephone or in person, with the staff of a Governmental Authority in
connection with the

 



-65-  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company will have the
right to have a representative present at any such meeting to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority and reasonably practical.

(d) The parties shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests for documentation or information or any request for additional
information (a "second request", under the HSR Act, or a "supplementary
information request", under the Competition Act) received from a Governmental
Authority and to all other inquiries and requests received from a
Governmental Authority in connection with Competition Law matters, and (ii)
use their reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Competition Laws and to cause the
waiting periods, approvals or other requirements under the HSR Act, the
Competition Act and all other Competition Laws to terminate or expire or be
obtained prior to the Termination Date.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the
efforts referenced in  _Sections 5.5(c)_ and _(d)_ to obtain all necessary
consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of any Governmental Authority
required, or considered by Parent to be advisable to be obtained, pursuant to
the HSR Act and the Competition Act, each party to this Agreement shall: (i)
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto, shall execute and deliver such
further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto
to evidence or reflect the Mergers (including the execution and delivery of
all documents, certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary
for all filings hereunder); (ii) use reasonable best efforts to give all
notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain each approval, consent, ratification, permission,
waiver or authorization required to be obtained by such party in connection
with the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company or a
Merger Sub to take, or cause to be taken, any action with respect to any of
the assets, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company), or any combination thereof (and the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any such action without Parents written
consent), (x) that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers or
(y) if such action would require Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree or commit to take any such
action, or agree to any condition or restriction or other mitigation,
involving the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, that would
have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each
case measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any action
contemplated by this _Section 5.5_, _provided_ that any such agreement or
action is conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Parent and each Merger Sub agrees to provide such
assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may
be reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority or other Person whose
consent or approval is sought hereunder. The foregoing agreement in this
section is made

 



-66-  solely to facilitate the closing of the Mergers and does not constitute a
representation or admission that the Mergers, if consummated without any
modification, would violate any Competition Laws or that agreeing to the
divestitures, hold separate conditions or other restrictions permitted herein
or suggested by any Person or authority acting under any Competition Law would
not be harmful to the parties. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall bear the
cost of any filing fee payable to a Governmental Authority in connection with
any filings made under this _Section 5.5_.

5.6. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion referenced
in _Section 7.6_ hereof. None of the parties shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries not to) take or fail to take any action which action
(or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
the Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger, taken together, from qualifying
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to,
within five (5) Business Days following the filing of any U.S. state income
or U.S. state franchise Tax Return, provide a copy of such Tax Return to
Parent.

5.7. _Registration_. No later than the later of (A) the Closing Date and (B)
promptly following the delivery of the Company Financial Statements but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days of such delivery, Parent shall file a Form
S-3 providing for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ")
registering all of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued by Parent
pursuant to Article II other than such shares of Parent Common Stock that
will be Beneficially Owned (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) by the
Significant Shareholders; _provided_ , that Parent may, at its option, elect
to register such shares of Parent Common Stock that will be Beneficially
Owned by the Significant Shareholders on the Shelf Registration Statement in
satisfaction of Parents obligations pursuant to Section 5.3(a) of the
Shareholders Agreement. If Parent is then eligible, such Shelf
Registration Statement shall be in the form of an automatic shelf
registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) or
any successor form thereto. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the
earlier of (i) three (3) years after the Shelf Registration Statement is filed
or, if later, has been declared effective and (ii) the date on which all
shares covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold thereunder;
_provided_ , that, to the extent the shares of Parent Common Stock held or
beneficially owned by the Significant Shareholders are covered by such Shelf
Registration Statement, Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the
continuing obligations under, the Shareholders Agreement with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to
facilitate sales of such shares by such shareholders from time to time.

 



-67- 5.8. _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. For the one (1) year period immediately
following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement as of the
Closing Date (a " _Union Employee_ ")) as of the Closing, to the extent that
each such employee remains employed with Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Company) as of and following the Closing (any such
employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i) at least the same annual
base salary or wage rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement and at
least the same bonus opportunities (excluding any equity-based bonus
opportunities) provided by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which
the Closing Date occurs and (ii) employee benefits (including paid time off
and perquisites but excluding any equity-based compensation or benefits) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those employee benefits provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall consider each Continuing Employee for equity-based
compensation and benefits that are the same as the equity-based compensation
and benefits customarily provided by Parent to the similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, other than the Continuing Employees.
For the avoidance of doubt, if any such Continuing Employee is entitled to
compensation or employee benefits under an individual employment or similar
agreement with Parent, the terms of such agreement and not this _Section
5.8(a)_ shall govern.

 

(b) _Recognition of Service; Pre-existing Conditions_. Periods of employment
with the Company or any of its current or former Affiliates, to the extent
previously recognized under any analogous Benefit Plan of the Company and its
Affiliates, shall be taken into account for all purposes, including, as
applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting, level of benefits, and
benefit accrual of any Continuing Employee under the corresponding employee
benefit plan offered by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the Continuing
Employees, including vacation plans or arrangements, defined contribution, and
any severance and welfare plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to recognize such service (x) for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, (y) for purposes of plans
which are frozen to new participants, or (z) to the extent such credit would
result in duplication of benefits. Additionally, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health insurance coverage of
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions under all applicable medical plans of Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent to the extent such condition was satisfied or waived under the
comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit all
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with all payments credited
against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such Person, in each case, under the comparable Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing Date during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which any such Person has satisfied his
or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum
under any health insurance plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for such
year.

 



-68- (c) _Severance_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.8(a)_ above, with
respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent
or any of its Affiliates on or prior to the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date under circumstances that would give rise to severance payments or
benefits under the Operating Subsidiarys Executive Severance Plan or the
Operating Subsidiarys Salary and Benefits Continuation Plan (as applicable,
the " _Severance Plan_ ") or Parents applicable severance plan or policy,
then, subject to such Continuing Employees execution of a release of claims
in a form customarily provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees,
Parent shall provide each such Continuing Employee with the greater of (i)
severance payments and benefits that such Continuing Employee would have
received under the Severance Plan and (ii) severance payments and benefits due
to a similarly situated employee of Parent or its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable (and for the avoidance of doubt,
in each case, such Continuing Employee shall be credited for all service with
the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates as provided in _Section
5.8(b)_ above); _provided_ ,  _however_ , if any such Continuing Employee is
entitled to severance benefits under an individual severance, employment or
similar agreement, the terms of such agreement and not this _Section 5.8(c)_
shall govern.

 

(d) _Union Matters_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Union
Employee, Parent shall provide for such compensation and benefits as are
required to be provided to such Union Employee pursuant to the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement.

 

(e) _Current Fiscal Year Bonuses_. The Company may pay all cash bonus amounts
payable under any annual bonus, sales and other cash incentive plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the fiscal year ending May 3, 2015
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, determined
based on actual results and performance achieved (" _Current Fiscal Year
Bonuses_ "). If the Closing occurs prior to the payment of the Current Fiscal
Year Bonuses, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Current Fiscal Year
Bonuses no later than July 15, 2015.

 

(f) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit
plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee or Union Employee. The provisions of this  _Section
5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this _Section 5.8_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Continuing Employee or Union Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right
of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person under an
employee benefit plan that such employee or beneficiary or other Person would
not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan without
regard to this Agreement.

 

5.9. _Section 280G_. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has obtained and
provided to Parent executed 280G Waivers (as defined below) from each
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) set forth on _Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its

 



-69-  reasonable best efforts to obtain from each other "disqualified individual"
that the Company, in good faith, determines would receive payments and/or
benefits that would separately or in the aggregate constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("
_Parachute Payments_ "), waivers, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
that provide that no Parachute Payments with respect to such "disqualified
individual" shall, in the absence of Stockholder Approval (as defined below),
be payable to or retained by such "disqualified individual" to the extent such
Parachute Payments would not be deductible by reason of the application of
Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition of the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code on such "disqualified individual" (the " _280G
Waivers_ "). Following the execution of the 280G Waivers, and prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall hold a vote to obtain approval by the Common
Stockholders, in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the
right of any "disqualified individual" to receive or retain any Parachute
Payments (the " _Stockholder Approval_ "). All materials produced by the
Company in connection with obtaining the Stockholder Approval shall be
provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance of any such
materials being delivered to Common Stockholders for Parents review and
comment, and the Company shall consider any of Parents requested changes or
comments in good faith and not unreasonably omit them. Within fifteen (15)
days following the date of this Agreement, with respect to each "disqualified
individual" of the Company, the Company shall furnish (i) a schedule that sets
forth (A) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of all payments or
benefits that could be provided to such "disqualified individual" as a result
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event), and (B) the "base amount" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such individual, and (ii) the
underlying data and documentation on which such schedule is based.

 

5.10. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall agree on a press
release announcing the entering into of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Thereafter, each party hereto will consult with the other
party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the terms hereof, and each party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any such press
release or make any such public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law or
regulation (including any New York Stock Exchange requirement).

 

5.11. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present employees, agents, officers and directors of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent such Persons are currently indemnified by the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys and its Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of present and former officers and directors as
in effect in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents immediately prior to the

 



-70-  Effective Time, except as required by applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to honor any indemnification agreements in effect
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any past or present
employees, agents, officers or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
in effect as of the date hereof. If the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns shall: (x) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (y) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.11_.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain
in effect for six (6) years from the Closing Date directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_")
on terms not less favorable than such existing insurance coverage; _provided_
that the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required, and
Parent shall not be required to cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, to pay for the DandO Insurance in an annual amount in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid as of
the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, with Parents prior
written consent, and at Parents request shall, prior to the Effective Time,
purchase six (6) years run-off directors and officers liability insurance
that is dedicated to the Company and its Subsidiaries and not shared with any
other entity that is unrelated to the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Runoff
D andO Insurance_"); _provided_ that the total payment for such insurance
coverage provided by such Runoff DandO Insurance shall not exceed two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance without
Parents prior written consent. If the cost of the Runoff DandO Insurance would
require an expenditure that exceeds such amount and Parent does not so
consent, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount. Any such Runoff DandO Insurance policies will
satisfy Parents obligation under this  _Section 5.11(b)_ to provide DandO
Insurance; _provided_ that in the event that any claim is brought under such
DandO Insurance, the policy shall be maintained until final disposition thereof.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company and of its Subsidiaries and

 



-71-  their respective heirs and legal representatives. The rights to
indemnification and advancement and the other rights provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such a Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

5.12. _Termination of Affiliate Agreements_. At or prior to the Adjustment
Time (and subject in each case to the occurrence of the Effective Time),
unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent or provided elsewhere herein,
the Company shall terminate, or otherwise amend to exclude the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries as a party thereto, all Affiliate Agreements, and all
amounts due and payable thereunder shall be paid in full, and any and all
future obligations owing thereunder shall be cancelled, in each case except
as otherwise provided on _Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter_,
and the Company shall take such other actions specified on _Section 5.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter_.

 

5.13. _Appraisal Notice_. The Company shall prepare and mail an appraisal
notice and notice of action taken by written consent of stockholders as and
to the extent required pursuant to Section 262 and Section 228(e) of the DGCL,
respectively, to any holder of Common Stock that has not consented to this
Agreement and the Mergers that complies with applicable Law, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and at a time reasonably agreed with Parent.

5.14. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and the Merger Subs shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing (or the permanent financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters in lieu thereof) on the terms and conditions described in
or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (including complying with
any request exercising so-called "flex" provisions), including using
reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding
in the Debt Financing Commitments or with respect to such permanent financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent and the Merger Subs shall
not (without the prior written consent of the Company) consent or agree to any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing, or enter into any other agreement or arrangement with respect to
alternative financing, if such amendment, modification or waiver or other
agreement or arrangement (1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing to an amount that, together with Parents and the Merger Subs cash
on hand or available alternative financing commitments, would be less than an
amount that would be required to fund the payment of the aggregate cash
consideration payable to holders of Common Stock, Options and Restricted Stock
Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the repayment, redemption, purchase,
defeasance or discharge of any outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money of
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the redemption, repayment or discharge of any notes or pursuant
to the termination of any existing credit facilities), and the payment of
fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith or pursuant to this
Agreement or (2) imposes new or additional material conditions or otherwise
materially expands any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing
or otherwise would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the funding or financing described therein or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt Parent and the Merger Subs shall be permitted to

 



-72-  consent or agree to any amendment or modification, or any waiver of any
provision, under the Debt Financing Commitments if such amendment,
modification or waiver solely adds lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Financing Commitments as of the date hereof as parties thereto. Parent and the
Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is
not a condition to the Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Debt Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries officers,
directors, employees, agents, and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, at Parents sole cost and expense, provide all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent and the
Merger Subs in the arrangement of any third party debt financing (including
the Debt Financing and any debt capital markets financing) for the purpose of
funding the payment of the aggregate cash consideration payable to holders of
Common Stock, Options and Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Agreement
and the repayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or discharge of any
outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money of any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the redemption,
repayment or discharge of any notes or pursuant to the termination of any
existing credit facilities), and the payment of fees and expenses incurred
in connection therewith or pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Financing_ "), including, without limitation,: (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, furnishing to Parent and the Financing Sources the
Required Information and such other information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of such
Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
completion of the Financing or otherwise in connection with the marketing or
placement of the Financing (" _Financing Offering Materials_ "); (ii)
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to participate in a reasonable
number of requested meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries senior management and Representatives,
presentations, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing; (iii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries independent accountants, as reasonably requested, to provide
reasonable assistance to Parent consistent with their customary
practice (including to consent to the use of their audit reports on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the
Operating Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any materials
relating to the Financing or in connection with any filings made with the SEC
or pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and to provide any
"comfort letters" (including drafts thereof) necessary and reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any debt capital markets transaction
comprising a part of the Financing (which such accountants would be prepared
to issue at the time of pricing and at closing of any offering or placement of
the Financing), in each case, on customary terms and consistent with their
customary practice) and to participate in reasonable and customary due
diligence sessions; and (iv) to the extent that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are to be party to the Financing following the occurrence of the
Effective Time, (x) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary
legal opinions and executing and delivering customary

 



-73-  closing certificates and documents at the Closing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing, (y) facilitating the
execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents (including loan
agreements, customary guarantee documentation (if applicable) and other
applicable loan documents) related to the Financing, and (z) to the extent
requested by the Financing Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, providing to the Financing Sources at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all customary and reasonable
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities with
respect to the Company under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 5.14_
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably
disrupt or interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the conduct thereof, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or
make any payment in connection with the Financing, prior to the occurrence of
the Effective Time (except to the extent Parent promptly reimburses (in the
case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses) or provides the
funding (in all other cases) to the Company or such Subsidiary therefor), or
incur any liability in connection with the Financing that is effective prior
to the occurrence of the Effective Time, or (C) require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or agreement, or agree to any
change or modification to any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior

agrees, promptly upon request, to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including
fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with the Financing promptly
following the incurrence thereof (but excluding any costs, fees and expenses
of preparing the Required Information set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of the
definition thereof, which shall not be reimbursed). Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, the Significant Shareholders, its and their
respective Affiliates, and its and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, awards, judgments and penalties of any type actually suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken, or cooperation
provided, by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.14_
and/or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically for use in connection therewith); in each case, except to the
extent that any such obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
awards, judgments and penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities
are suffered or incurred as a result of the Companys or its Representatives
gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material breach of this
Agreement, as applicable. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, provided such logos
are used solely in a customary manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and on such
other customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.
Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing (including the Debt Financing), or any alternative financing, is
not a condition to the Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing (including the Debt Financing) or any
alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or

 



-74-  waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_. Notwithstanding anything

its potential financing sources and their Representatives, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential financing sources
with respect thereto.

 

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions solely in the Companys control required
to facilitate the termination of commitments in respect of each of the Term
Loan Credit Agreement and the ABL Revolving Credit Agreement and, to the
extent requested in writing by Parent, any Indebtedness incurred by any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof pursuant to _Section
5.2(d) _(it being understood that the Company shall promptly and in any event
no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date notify Parent of the
amount of any such Indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and expected to be
outstanding on the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 5.2(d)_), repayment in
full of all obligations in respect of such Indebtedness and release of any
Liens securing such Indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith on
the Closing Date (such terminations, repayments and releases, the " _Existing
Credit Facility Terminations_ "). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver to Parent on the Closing Date payoff letters with respect to each
of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Revolving Credit Agreement and, to
the extent requested by Parent, any Indebtedness incurred by any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof pursuant to _Section
5.2(d)_ (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons
to whom such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters together with any
related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff
amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries securing such Indebtedness and any other obligations secured
thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the
applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to the Closing, be released and
terminated _provided_ , that (A) Parent shall provide all funds required to
effect all such repayments at or prior to the Closing and (B) in no event
shall this  _Section 5.14(c)_ require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to (x) cause any Existing Credit Facility Terminations to be effective until
the Closing shall have occurred, (y) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any
costs or expenses, or make any payment in connection with the Existing Credit
Facility Terminations, prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time (except
to the extent Parent promptly reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-
of-pocket costs and expenses) or provides the funding (in all other cases) to
the Company or such Subsidiary therefor), or incur any liability in connection
with the Existing Credit Facility Termination that is effective prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, or (z) issue any prepayment, commitment
termination, commitment reduction or other similar notice under or in
connection with the Existing Credit Facility Termination that is effective
prior to or is not conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the written
request of Parent, (i) issue one or more notices of optional redemption for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Company Notes, pursuant
to the Company Note Indenture in order to effect a redemption on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that such redemption notice shall be subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and (if Parent elects)
the receipt by Parent of financing in an amount sufficient to effect such
redemption in full, and (if the Company 

 



-75-  elects) the receipt by the Company no later than the redemption time
specified in such redemption notice of funds in an amount sufficient to effect
such redemption in full, in each case to the extent permitted under the
Company Note Indenture and (ii) use its and their reasonable best efforts to
provide any other cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the
redemption of the Company Notes (and/or, if elected by Parent, satisfaction
and discharge of the Company Notes pursuant to the Company Note Indenture)
effective as of and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited funds with the Company
Note Trustee sufficient to fund any repayment, redemption or discharge of the
Company Notes no later than the redemption time specified in the applicable
redemption notice (subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time).

 

(e) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including fees
and disbursements of counsel) in connection with the repayment, redemption or
discharge of any Company Notes and the Existing Credit Facility Terminations
promptly following the incurrence thereof (and such costs, fees and
expenses shall not be deemed Transaction Expenses hereunder).

5.15. _No Solicitation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and
shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, without the prior written
consent of the other party, directly or indirectly, use information received
from the other party, its Subsidiaries or representatives in connection with
the evaluation and negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for purposes of soliciting to employ or hire (whether as an officer,
employee or consultant or other independent contractor) any individual who is
currently or hereafter becomes a senior officer of the other party or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions of this
_Section 5.15_ shall not apply (i) to any general advertisement, or any
search firm engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or focused on
personnel employed by the other party or its Affiliates, (ii) the solicitation
or hiring of any individual whose employment or term in office was terminated
by the other party or its Subsidiary or (iii) the solicitation or hiring by
Parent of any individual if such individuals commencement of employment is
contingent on the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereunder.

 

5.16. _Company Stockholder Approval_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a true and complete copy
of a written consent evidencing the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers
and the transactions contemplated hereby by the Companys stockholders holding
at least 99% of the outstanding Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and
in any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) a
written consent evidencing the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated hereby by all of the Common Stockholders other than

5.17. _Inspections_. Following the execution of this Agreement, Parent may, at
its sole cost and expense, undertake Phase I Environmental Site Assessments
of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property (subject to any landlords
approval or consent as may be required with respect to Leased Real Property,
and prior reasonable notice to the Company of the date and time of any such
inspections and examinations, which shall occur during normal business hours),
which Phase I Environmental Site Assessments shall be conducted in a manner

 



-76-  and at times so as to not unreasonably disrupt the Companys business
operations, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to the
foregoing, it being agreed that in no event may Parent conduct any Phase II
Environmental Assessments or any invasive or destructive environmental testing
or sampling of the Company Real Property. The foregoing covenant shall be
subject to the limitations to access set forth in  _Section 5.1_.

5.18. _Delivery of Certain Financial Information_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to Parent (i) as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof but in any event prior to the Closing Date,
the Company Financial Statements and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof and unless and until the Marketing Period has otherwise
commenced, the other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
constituting the Required Information (assuming for this purpose that the
Required Information relates to information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries). The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to consult with the Company and its representatives, including its independent
accountants, from time to time prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the
progress of the preparation of such Company Financial Statements and such
other information.

STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

9.1. _Designation and Replacement of Stockholder Representative_. The holders

appointment and that the Stockholder Representative shall act as a
representative for the benefit of each Equityholder as the exclusive agent and
attorney in fact with the power and authority to act on behalf of each

responsibilities as representative of the Equityholders, the Stockholder
Representative shall cause the Significant Shareholders to, within ten (10)
days after the occurrence of such event, appoint a successor representative

Representative hereto and, promptly thereafter, shall notify the Equityholders
of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed to the
rights and obligations of the Stockholder Representative as representative of
the Equityholders hereunder and shall be deemed the "Stockholder
Representative" for all purposes hereunder. The grant of authority by the
Equityholders to the Stockholder Representative in this _Article IX_ is
and shall be coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in this

the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to
act of any of the Equityholders and shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Closing.

9.2. _Authority and Rights of Stockholder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_.

(a) The Stockholder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;

to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, by the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each
Equityholder irrevocably shall agree that the Stockholder Representative shall
have full power, authority and discretion on behalf of the Equityholders to:

 

(i) execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as the
Stockholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable, including any amendments or modifications to this Agreement;

enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Stockholder
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement or the transactions provided for herein, and to take any and all
actions which the Stockholder Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of each Equityholder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder
Representative may on behalf of the Equityholders (A) assert any claim or
institute any action, proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend,
contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated
by Parent or any other Person, or by any Government Authority against the
Stockholder Representative and/or any of the Equityholders; (C) receive

investigation; (D) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may
deem advisable or necessary; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any

such actions);

(iii) refrain from enforcing any right of the Equityholders, and/or the
Stockholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating
to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the
Stockholder Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Stockholder
Representative or by the Equityholders unless such waiver is in writing signed
by the Stockholder Representative;

(iv) make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do

absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this

remaining portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount to satisfy
costs, expenses and/or Liabilities of the Stockholder Representative in
connection with matters related to this Agreement, with any balance of the
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be
disbursed and paid, at such time as the Stockholder Representative
determines, in its sole discretion, that no additional such costs, expenses
and/or Liabilities shall become due and payable, to the Equityholders
(including the holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards) on a pro rata
basis based on their respective equity interest in the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing (calculated taking into account the Excluded
Restricted Stock Awards (including with respect to the calculation of
the Fully-Diluted Outstanding Stock) and, with respect to Options, on a Net
Option Share basis for these purposes); _provided_ that the Stockholder
Representative shall pay the portion of such amount allocable to the Options
to the Company (on behalf of the holders of Options), and the Company shall,
in turn, pay such amount to the holders of the Options (subject to applicable
withholding Tax) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
payment from the Stockholder Representative and that the Stockholder
Representative shall pay the portion of such amount allocable in respect of
the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards to the Escrow Property Agent or the
holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards, if then in possession of the

subject to _Section 2.10(f)_, any portion remaining of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Holdback Amount after the final payment of all amounts payable
under _Section 2.10(e)_ has been made shall be disbursed and paid to the
Equityholders (including the holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards)

in turn, pay such amount to the holders of the Options (subject to applicable
withholding Tax) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
payment from the Stockholder Representative and that the Stockholder
Representative shall pay the portion of such amount allocable in respect of
the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards to the Escrow Property Agent or the
holders of the Excluded Restricted Stock Awards, if then in possession of the
Excluded Restricted Stock Award Escrow Property. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Parent nor the Company shall have any liability whatsoever related to
or arising out of any such distribution or allocation or the determination
thereof to the extent in accordance with the instructions of the Stockholder
Representative.

 



-83- (b) All actions taken by the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement
shall be binding upon the Equityholders and their respective successors and
assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.

the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

(c) By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Equityholder irrevocably
shall agree that the Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to
any Equityholder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its
capacity as the Stockholder Representative and that the Stockholder
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Significant Shareholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction,
and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative, unless the Stockholder Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination
of Stockholder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Stockholder
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Stockholder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each
Equityholder irrevocably shall agree that the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.
Without limiting _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_, by the execution of a Letter of
Transmittal each Equityholder irrevocably shall agree that the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount for all expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents
and consultants) incurred by the Stockholder Representative in such capacity,
and shall be entitled to indemnification from the Equityholders against any
loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative (except for those
arising out of Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. To the extent the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount is
insufficient to cover the Stockholder Representatives costs, expenses and
liabilities hereunder, the Equityholders will indemnify the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence on a pro
rata basis based on their respective equity interest in the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the term
"Equityholders" shall not include the Company or any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company.

9.3. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder Representative_. The
Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger
Subs as follows:

(a) It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. It has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

 



-84- (b) The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement do not and will not conflict with
or violate any provision of, or require the consent or approval of any Person
(except for any such consents or approvals which have been obtained) under,
(x) applicable Laws, (y) its organizational documents or (z) any contract or
agreement to which it is a party, except to the extent any such conflict,
violation, consent or approval would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the Stockholder Representatives ability to perform its obligations
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other analogous action on its part. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder
Representative and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Stockholder Representative enforceable against the Stockholder Representative
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect which affect the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by rules of Law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and equitable principles.

or to such other individual or address as a party hereto may designate for
itself by notice given as herein provided.

10.4. _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its
right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any
condition or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no
waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or
a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty.

10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such 

 



-87-  counterpart and copies produced therefrom shall have the same effect as an
original. To the extent applicable, the foregoing constitutes the election of
the parties hereto to invoke any Law authorizing electronic signatures.

10.6. _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of the
Company Disclosure Letter are for convenience only and shall not be deemed
part of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter or be given any effect in interpreting this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. The use of the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of this
Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all cases
herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without limitation,"
respectively. Underscored references to Articles, Sections or Exhibits shall
refer to those portions of this Agreement. Any singular term in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term in this
Agreement the singular. "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to
printing, typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic
format) in a visible form. If any action under this Agreement is required to
be done or taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall
be required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding
Business Day thereafter. The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of like import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any capitalized
term used in any Exhibit, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning
given to such term in this Agreement. References from or through any date
shall mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively. All references to dollars or to "$" shall be
references to United States dollars.

 

10.7. _APPLICABLE LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

10.8. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

10.9.  _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by
Parent or the Surviving Company without the prior written consent of the
Company; _provided_ that with the consent of Parent, either Merger Sub may
assign (in whole but not in part) its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to another wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in contravention of this _Section 10.9_ shall be null and void.

10.10. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the parties hereto and, except for (i) _Section 5.11_, _Section 8.3_,
_Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.12_ and (ii) as to the Financing Sources,
the provisions of _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.7_, this _Section 10.10_,
_Section 10.11_,

 



-88-   _Section 10.15_ and _Section 10.16_, no provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed to confer upon third parties, either express or implied, any remedy,
claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

10.11. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the
entities and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement in their capacities as such and no former, current or future
stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of any party hereto, or any former, current or future direct or
indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party. The
Company, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the Financing
Sources shall be subject to no liability or claims by the Company or its
Affiliates (other than the Parent and its pre-Closing Affiliates), whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, any breach of the Debt Financing Commitments or in
connection with the Debt Financing or the performance of services by the
Financing Sources with respect to the foregoing. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against the Financing Sources.

 

10.12. _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Surviving Company and each of its former, present and future
Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing, a " _Releasing Party_ "), hereby releases
and forever discharges each former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of the foregoing
(or a fiduciary of any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any of its
present or former Subsidiaries) (each of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_
") from any and all claims, rights, obligations, debts, liabilities, actions
or causes of action of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen,
contingent or actual, and whether now known or hereafter discovered, which any
of the Releasing Parties had, now has or may in the future have, at law or in
equity, against any Released Party in any way arising out of, in connection
with, pertaining to or by reason of (i) their respective status as such or
(ii) any acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by any of them in
their respective capacities as such, which acts or omissions existed or
occurred at or prior to the Closing (each, a " _Released Claim_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Releasing Parties expressly do not release their
rights and interests (i) under (y) this Agreement or the Shareholders
Agreement or (z) the Confidentiality Agreements, (ii) with respect to claims,
actions, causes of action or any liabilities that arise as a result of fraud,
intentional

 



-89-  misrepresentation, willful misconduct or other criminal act by the Released
Party or (iii) with respect to any claim of, or liability to, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any successor thereof) against any Released Party
to the extent resulting from the Released Partys status as an employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and each
Merger Sub covenants and agrees that it will honor such release and will not,
and will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any
action inconsistent therewith (including commencing any Litigation with
respect to, or directly or indirectly transferring to another Person,
any Released Claim). This _Section 10.12_ shall survive the Closing, is
intended for the benefit of and may be enforced directly by each of the
Released Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and permitted assigns
of Parent and the Surviving Company.

10.13. _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the
Surviving Company, each party will, on and after the Closing Date, execute
and deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate the Mergers and to
effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

10.14. _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof. This Agreement, the Shareholders
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements set forth the entire agreement
and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and
understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

10.15. _JURISDICTION OF DISPUTES_. IN THE EVENT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
COMMENCES ANY LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH
OR RELATING TO NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR
ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN, THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY (A) AGREE THAT ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION SHALL BE INSTITUTED EXCLUSIVELY
IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WHETHER A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT; (B) AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH
LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION, SUCH PARTIES WILL CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN ANY SUCH COURT DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (A) OF THIS
_SECTION 10.15_ AND TO SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
RULES AND STATUTES GOVERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS; (C) AGREE TO WAIVE TO THE
FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE
TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT OR
THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM; (D) AGREE AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF SERVICE TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BY MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS
SET FORTH IN _SECTION 10.3_ FOR COMMUNICATIONS TO SUCH PARTY; (E) AGREE THAT
ANY SERVICE MADE AS PROVIDED HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN
EVERY RESPECT; AND (F) AGREE THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF

 



-90-  ANY PARTY TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW;
_PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH IN
_SECTION 2.10_ SHALL BE GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION
2.10_.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF
ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION,
WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST
THE FINANCING SOURCES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CURRENT, FORMER OR FUTURE
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, GENERAL OR LIMITED PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS, MEMBERS,
MANAGERS, CONTROLLING PERSONS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES OR ADVISORS, IN EACH
CASE, THAT ARE NOT PARTIES HERETO, IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF, IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
COUNTY OF NEW YORK OR, IF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW JURISDICTION IS VESTED IN THE
FEDERAL COURTS, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK (AND APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF).

 

10.16. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW, AND THEREFORE, EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
OTHERWISE HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE
DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO OR ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.16_.

10.17. _Disclosure Letters_. Disclosure in any section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall apply
only to the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion
of information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or its 

 



-91-  Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. In
addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
shall not be construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under
any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further, neither the specification
of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business (except where expressly stated in the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be construed as an
admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or
controversy.

10.18. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

10.19. _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed
as mutually chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

 

10.20. _Privilege and Related Matters_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto, including the Stockholder Representative, that the Company
has engaged certain outside attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives in connection with various pending or threatened Litigation
and other matters, including without limitation Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP, KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in connection with
certain matters arising out of the Consumer Products Purchase Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (such advisors and representatives,
collectively, the " _Existing Advisors_ " and such Litigation and other
matters, collectively, the " _Existing Matters_ "). It is expressly agreed by
each of the parties hereto, including the Stockholder Representative, that
such Existing Advisors have been engaged by the Company with respect to the
Existing Matters, and not by the Stockholder Representative, the Significant
Shareholders or any other Person and all work product, which has

 



-92-  been shared with the Company, prepared by the Existing Advisors for the
Company in connection with any Existing Matter (for the avoidance of doubt,
not including internal correspondence among employees of the Existing
Advisors), and any attorney-client privilege relating thereto, belongs solely
to the Company and not to the Stockholder Representative, the Significant
Shareholders or any other Person. To the extent that any material subject to
the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine, as regards the
Existing Matters, has been shared with the Stockholder Representative or the
Significant Shareholders, whether prior to or after the date hereof, it is
the parties desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of
such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
such materials continued protection under the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or the work product doctrine. The Stockholder Representative
agrees that, from and after the Closing, (a) it shall not, and shall cause the
Significant Shareholders not to, seek to have any Existing Advisor
disqualified from representing the Company in connection with any Existing
Matter, and (b) the Company will have the sole and exclusive right to decide
whether or not to waive any attorney-client privilege or work product
protection that may apply with respect to any communications or materials
prepared in connection with any Existing Matter and shared with the Company
(for the avoidance of doubt, not including internal correspondence among
employees of the Existing Advisors). From and after the Closing, the Company
(and not the Stockholders Representative, the Significant Shareholders or any
other Person) shall be the sole holder of the attorney-client privilege or
work product protection with respect to the engagement of the Existing
Advisors in connection with the Existing Matters.
