otherwise provided for herein or by Law.

  



  

2.10 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

holder who complies in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Closing Payment Shares, but shall

the DGCL. At the Effective Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under
the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes

in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall have
been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after
the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be deemed to have
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Closing Payment Shares (upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) in respect of such shares as if such shares never had been
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver (or cause to be issued
and delivered) to the holder thereof, following the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in this Agreement, the applicable portion of
the Closing Payment Shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and,
following the Effective Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor
Parent shall, except with the prior written consent of the other party (in
its sole discretion), or as otherwise required under the DGCL, (i) make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any claim or demand in respect of any
Dissenting Shares., (ii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of

 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
 CONSIDERATION

  



  

4.1 _Conversion of Company Securities; Convertible Notes_.

  



  

(a)  _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.10_ , at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Company Securityholders, each
share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and
automatically converted into the right to receive a number of Parent Class A
Shares equal to the Closing Consideration Conversion Ratio, in each case, as
set forth on the Capitalization Schedule delivered prior to Closing, subject
to _Section 4.1(i)_ and _Article XI_. If any shares of Company Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are shares of
Company Restricted Stock, then the Parent Class A Shares issued in
exchange for such Company Restricted Stock pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall to the same extent be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option or risk of forfeiture, and the certificates and/or book
entries representing such Parent Class A Shares shall accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Options._ The Company shall terminate the Equity
Incentive Plans at or prior to the Effective Time, contingent on the
closing of the Merger. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no
longer be outstanding and each Person who previously held Company Options
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Options, except as
set forth in this _Section 4.1(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Boards
of Directors of the Company and Parent (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) shall, as applicable, take all corporate actions necessary,
including adopting appropriate resolutions and obtaining consents of the
holders of the Company Options, if required, to provide that, as of the
Effective Time, that each Company Option shall be assumed by Parent and shall
continue in full force and effect, containing the same terms, conditions,
vesting and other provisions as are currently applicable to such Company
Options; _provided_ that (A) each such Company Option shall be exercisable for
such number of Parent Class A Shares that equals the Closing Consideration
Conversion Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, subject to _Section 4.1(i)_ and  _Article XI_ and at such
per share exercise price that shall equal the per share exercise price of
such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Closing Consideration Conversion Ratio (as so converted, a " _Converted
Company Option_ "), _further provided_ that (B) with respect to each such
Company Option, any fractional shares that would be issuable upon exercise
thereof will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Class A
Shares and the per share exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Parent shall adopt the Parent Equity Incentive Plan, which will
cover the Company Options, pursuant to _Section 9.6_;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the per share exercise price and the number of Parent Class A Shares
purchasable pursuant to each Converted Company Option shall be determined in
a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; 
_further provided_ that in the case of any Unvested Company Options to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of Parent
Class A Shares purchasable pursuant to the applicable Converted Company Option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.

Note will be converted into Company Series B Preferred Stock in accordance
with the terms thereof, in each case, as set forth on Capitalization Schedule
delivered prior to Closing.

  



  

(e) _Conversion of Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of Merger Sub that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by
virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, be converted into and become one share of the
Surviving Corporation (and the shares of Surviving Corporation into which the
shares of Merger Sub are so converted shall be the only shares of the
Surviving Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger
Sub will, as of the Effective Time, be deemed to evidence ownership of
such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(f) _Treatment of Shares of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company_. At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

  



  

(g) _Surrender of Certificates_. All Closing Payment Shares issued upon the
surrender and cancellation of the Company Common Stock, in accordance with the
terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such securities, other than the additional obligations
of Parent and the rights of the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 11.3_.

  



  

(h) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates or securities, as the case may be, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof (without the requirement to post
a bond), such securities, as may be required pursuant to this _Section 4.1_
and _Section 11.3_.

  



  

(i) _Escrow Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other
provisions of this Agreement, Parent shall withhold from the Closing
Payment Shares issued to each applicable holder of Company Capital Stock at
Closing the portion of the Escrow Shares set forth next to such holder of
Company Capital Stock's name on the Capitalization Schedule, all of which
shall, as reflected in the Capitalization Schedule, be withheld on a pro rata
basis in proportion to each Escrow Participant's Pro Rata Portion. The
aggregate amount of such shares withheld shall equal Escrow Shares.

  



  

   

18

 



    



 

(j)   __Capitalization Schedule__. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a final and
updated Capitalization Schedule, which (A) updates the number of shares of
Company Series B Preferred Stock that are issued upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes, updates the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding to reflect the issuance of such Company Common Stock upon
exercise of Company Options after the date hereof and updates the of Vested
Company Options prior to the Closing Date and (B) sets forth the following

of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of such Company
Security and the exercise price per share for such Company Security; (iii)
the vesting arrangements with respect to each Company Security held by such
Company Securityholder (including the vesting schedule, vesting commencement
date, date fully vested and the extent to which such Company Security is or
will be vested as of the Effective Time); (iv) the total number of Parent
Class A Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ in respect of each share
of Company Capital Stock held by such Company Securityholder; (v) the total

Company Warrant, respectively, held by such Company Securityholder, and the
respective exercise price per share applicable to such Company Option and the
Company Warrant following the Effective Time; (vi) the number of Escrow Shares
deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Company Securityholder
pursuant to _Section 4.1(i)_; and (vii) such Company Securityholder's Pro
Rata Portion, if any. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.1(j)_ or in the
updated Capitalization Schedule delivered pursuant hereto shall be construed
or deemed to: (x) modify the Company's obligations to obtain Parent's prior
consent to the issuance of any securities pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(xvi)_ ;
or (y) alter or amend the total aggregate number of Closing Payment Shares
issuable or reserved for issuance to the Company Securityholders; or (z)
alter or amend the definition of Closing Consideration Conversion Ratio.

  



  

4.2   _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Class A Shares, or
certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Class A Shares, will be
issued upon the conversion of the Company Capital Stock pursuant to the
Merger, including with respect to any release of the Escrow Shares pursuant
to _Section 4.1(i)_ and the Escrow Agreement, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent. Any fractional Parent Class A Shares will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number of Parent Class A Shares.

  



  

4.3   _Withholding_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation shall provide recipients of consideration with a
reasonable opportunity to provide documentation establishing exemptions from
or reductions of such withholdings.

nature, specifying as to each, as applicable: (i) the nature of such

pursuant to which any Person is authorized to use such Intellectual Property
Right. In the past two (2) years, the Company has not abandoned any patents or
non-provisional patent applications. The Company owns, has valid and
enforceable licenses for or otherwise has adequate rights to use Intellectual
Property Rights as set forth on _Schedule 5.18(a)_. The Intellectual Property
Rights of the Company have not been adjudged by a court of
competent jurisdiction invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. As of

required to be listed on _Schedule 5.18(a)_ is challenged in any interference,
opposition, reissue, reexamination, revocation or equivalent proceeding, and
to the Knowledge of the Company, no such proceeding has been threatened in
writing with respect to any such Intellectual Property Rights. As of the date

connection with such registered Intellectual Property Rights have been paid
and all documents, recordations and certificates in connection with such

licensed to, the Company.

Rights listed on _Schedule 5.18(a)_ are subsisting and all the granted
patents are valid and enforceable. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is
no granted patent owned by any third party containing a valid claim that (i)
is required by the Company to conduct its material business as currently
conducted and (ii) the Company is not currently authorized to use. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the use of any Intellectual Property Rights in
connection with the operation of the material business of the Company do not
conflict with, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual
Property Rights, including rights of privacy, publicity and endorsement, of
any third party. The Company is not challenging the patentability of a third
party patent. The Intellectual Property Rights set forth on
_Schedule 5.18(a)_ include all of the material patent rights owned by or
licensed to the Company used in the ordinary day-to-day conduct of the
business of the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no prior
art that may render any patent within the Intellectual Property Rights
invalid. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no material defects in any
of the patents or patent applications within the Intellectual Property
Rights.

described on _Schedule 5.18(a)_ , infringe or otherwise violate, any
patent, trademark, tradename, service name, copyright, trade secret or other
proprietary right of any other Person. Within the past five (5) years (or

been a defendant in any Action that involves a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Rights.

pursuant to Parent's amended and restated certificate of incorporation) to
any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none

negotiations with any Persons other than the Company or Parent, as applicable,
concerning any Alternative Transaction. Each of the Company and Parent shall
be responsible for any acts or omissions of any of its respective
Representatives that, if they were the acts or omissions of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, would be deemed a breach of such party's
obligations hereunder (it being understood that such responsibility shall be

of interest in entering into, an Alternative Transaction, communicated in
writing to the Company or Parent or any of their respective representatives or
agents (each, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), such party shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt
thereof) advise the other parties to this Agreement, orally and in writing,
of such Alternative Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such
Alternative Proposal. The Company and Parent shall keep each other informed
on a reasonably current basis of material developments with respect to any
such Alternative Proposal. As used herein with respect to Parent, the term
"Alternative Proposal" shall not include the receipt by Parent of
any unsolicited communications (including the receipt of draft non-disclosure
agreements) in the ordinary course of business inquiring as to Parent's
interest in a potential target for a business combination; provided, however,
that Parent shall inform the person initiating such communication of the

prior to the date hereof) shall affect any representation or warranty given by

unreasonably with the conduct of the Business of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary expressed or implied in this Agreement, neither
party shall be required to provide the access described above or disclose any
information to the other party if doing so is, in such party's reasonable
judgement, reasonably likely to (i) result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or (ii) violate any
contract to which it is a party or to which it is subject or applicable Law.

  



  

7.4   _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify the other party of:

  



  

(a)  any notice or other communication from any Person alleging or raising
the possibility that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement might give rise to any Action or

to cause any of the conditions set forth in ___ARTICLE _ X not to be
satisfied.

other information furnished by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement). The Company represents and warrants that the information relating
to the Company supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, as applicable, as of the Effective Date and the date on
which the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first
distributed to Parent Stockholders or at the time of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time, a change in the information relating to the
Company or any other information furnished by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which would make the preceding
sentence incorrect, should be discovered by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
as applicable, such party shall promptly notify the other parties of such
change or discovery and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to Parent's stockholders. In connection
therewith, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall instruct their respective
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent as relevant if required to
achieve the foregoing.

the name of Parent to "Gemini Therapeutics, Inc."; (iii) adoption and approval
of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent in the form attached hereto as

approval of the issuance of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock to the Company Securityholders in connection
with the Merger under applicable exchange listing rules; (vi) approval to
adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting, if necessary; and (vii) approval to

Proposals_ ").

  



  

(f)  Parent, with the assistance of the Company, shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the S-4 and the Proxy Statement to "clear" comments
from the SEC and the S-4 to become effective as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The Offer Documents shall provide the public stockholders of
Parent with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public Parent
Class A Shares, up to that number of Parent Class A Shares that would permit
Parent to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 (the "
_Offering Shares_ "), at a price per share determined in accordance with the
Parent Certificate of Incorporation, all in accordance with applicable Law
and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. In accordance with the
Parent Certificate of Incorporation, the proceeds held in the Trust Account
will be used for the redemption of the Parent Class A Shares held by
Parent's public stockholders who have elected to redeem such shares, if any.

  



  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Additional Agreements, Parent may make any public filing with respect to the
Merger to the extent required by applicable Law.

practicable after the Effective Date for the purpose of seeking the approval
of each of the Parent Proposals, and Parent shall consult in good faith with
the Company with respect to the date on which such meeting is to be held.
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger and this
Agreement. The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion of the Proxy
Statement shall include disclosure regarding the Company and its management,
operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the Company agrees to as
promptly as reasonably practical provide Parent with such information as shall
be reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in or attachment to the Proxy
Statement, and that such information is accurate in all material respects and
complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Company understands that such information shall be included in the Proxy
Statement/Form S-4 or responses to comments from the SEC or its staff in
connection therewith. The Company shall make, and cause each Subsidiary to
make, their managers, directors, officers and employees available to Parent
and its counsel in connection with the drafting of such filings and mailings
and responding in a timely manner to comments from the SEC.

Shares (the " _Parent Redemption Amount_ "), (b) deferred underwriting
commissions and the expenses to third parties to which they are owed, and (c)
the remaining monies in the Trust Account to Parent after the Closing.

cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to

date as expressly set forth in such representation or warranty; or (b) any
breach or nonfulfillment of any covenants of the Company contained in this
Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
liability of the Escrow Participants under this Agreement, including this 
_Article XI_ or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to (i) the Escrow
Share Value, __multiplied__ by (ii) the Escrow Shares (the " _Indemnifiable
Loss Limit_ "). Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section  11.1_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred
by Parent equals at least $1,612,500 (the " _Basket_ "), at which time,
subject to the Indemnifiable Loss Limit, Parent shall be entitled to
indemnification for any and all Losses above the Basket. The Escrow
Participants shall have no liability or obligation to indemnify Parent or any
other Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect to the breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, based on any matter, fact or
circumstance Known by Parent on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

11.2   _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by
an Indemnified Party for indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_:

  



  

(a)  An Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders' Representative prompt
notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of (i) any event, circumstance,
development, state of facts or occurrence of which such Indemnified Party is
aware that resulted or may result in any Losses by any Indemnified Party with
respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement and/or (ii) any third-party action with respect to which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in reasonable detail the Loss
that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The failure to
promptly give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights
or benefits of such Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE XI_ , except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the ability of the Stockholders'
Representative, on behalf of the Escrow Participants (the " _Indemnifying
Parties_ "), to defend such claim or increases the amount of such liability.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(b)  In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is
sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
the sole expense and liability of the Escrow Participants, to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim
unless the Stockholders' Representative, within a reasonable time after the
giving of an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party (but in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter), shall (x) notify such
Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Indemnifying Parties to
assume the defense thereof and (y) retain legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third-
Party Claim.

  



  

(c)  If the Stockholders' Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, assumes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 11.2(b)_, then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Stockholders' Representative in any manner reasonably requested in connection
with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept
fully informed by the Stockholders' Representative and its legal counsel with
respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Stockholders' Representative so assumes the defense
of any such Third-Party Claim the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Stockholders' Representative has agreed, on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties, to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named
parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include an Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be a conflict of
interest between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the
conduct of the defense thereof, in which event the reasonable documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of such separate counsel of the Indemnified Party
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties, subject to the limitations set
forth in this ___ARTICLE XI_.

  



  

(d)  If the Stockholders' Representative elects to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 11.2(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from
such asserted liability unless the Stockholders' Representative withdraws
from or fails to adequately prosecute the defense of such asserted liability
or Third-Party Claim, or unless a judgment is entered against the Indemnified
Party for such liability by an Authority of competent jurisdiction. If the
Stockholders' Representative does not elect to defend, or if, after commencing
or undertaking any such defense, the Stockholders' Representative withdraws
from or fails to adequately prosecute such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the
Indemnifying Parties' expense, subject to the limitations set forth in this
___ARTICLE XI_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in,
and the Indemnified Parties (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties)
shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x)
that part of any Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining
order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against
such Indemnified Parties, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim
involves criminal allegations against such Indemnified Parties or (y) the
entire Third-Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on
the part of such Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than the
amount as to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Parties retain control of
the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Parties will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(e)  If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to _Section 11.1_ and this _Section 11.2_ and proposes to
settle the same prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with
respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders'
Representative prompt written notice thereof and the Stockholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) shall have the right
to participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or
prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The
Stockholders' Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of
such Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any
relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be sought against
such Indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be
reasonably expected to impose or create a monetary liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party (such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income
Tax liability), other than the monetary claim of the third party in such
Third-Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or
(iii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant, person conducting such investigation or initiating such hearing,
plaintiff or petitioner to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and all other actions (known
or unknown) arising or which might arise out of the same facts.

  



  

(f)  Following the Closing, the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of Parent shall have the authority to institute and prosecute any
claims for indemnification hereunder in good faith on behalf of Parent or any
other Indemnified Party to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

11.3   _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Escrow Participants_. The Company and the
Company Securityholders hereby authorize Parent to deliver the Escrow Shares
to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow (such Escrow Shares, together with
any dividends or other distributions of any kind made in respect thereof and
any earnings thereon, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. For purposes of this ___ARTICLE XI_ , the Escrow Shares are valued
at the greater of: (a) $10.00 per share and (b) the VWAP (the " _Escrow Share
Value_ ").

  



  

(a)  Any dividends or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the
Escrow Shares will be delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent to be held in
escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Each Escrow Participant
shall be entitled to vote such Escrow Participant's Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Shares on any matters to come before the stockholders of Parent. It is
intended that for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and foreign)
income tax purposes that while the Escrow Shares are held by the Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Participants shall be treated as owners of the Escrow
Shares, and to the extent required by applicable Law, the Escrow Agent shall
report in a manner consistent with such treatment.

  



  

(b)  At the times provided for in _Section 11.3(d)_, the Escrow Shares shall
be distributed to each Escrow Participant in accordance with such Escrow
Participant's Pro Rata Portion. Parent will take such action as may be
necessary to cause such securities to be issued in the names of the
appropriate Persons. Certificates representing Escrow Shares so issued that
are subject to resale restrictions under applicable securities laws will bear
a legend to that effect. No fractional shares shall be released and delivered
from the Escrow Fund and all fractional shares shall be rounded to the
nearest whole share.

  



  

(c)  No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest therein may be pledged,
sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law, by the Escrow
Participants or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the Escrow Participants, prior
to the delivery to such Escrow Participants of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow
Agent as provided herein.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(d)   As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days, following expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "),
the Escrow Shares, __less__ the number of Escrow Shares (at an assumed
value equal to the Escrow Share Value per Escrow Share) reasonably necessary
to serve as security for Losses set forth in any Indemnification Notice
delivered by Parent prior to the expiration of the Survival Period with
respect to any claims for indemnification that remain pending and unresolved
as of the Release Date, will be released from escrow to the Escrow
Participants (in accordance with each Escrow Participant's Pro Rata Portion).
The Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall jointly issue to the
Escrow Agent a certificate executed by each of them instructing the Escrow
Agent to release such number of Escrow Shares (in accordance with each Escrow
Participant's Pro Rata Portion) determined in accordance with this _Section
11.3(d)_. Promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days,
following the resolution, in accordance with the provisions of this  __
_ARTICLE XI_ , of any claim(s) for indemnification that remain unresolved as
of the Release Date, the Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall jointly
issue to the Escrow Agent a certificate executed by each of them instructing
the Escrow Agent to release to each Escrow Participant (in accordance with
such Escrow Participant's Pro Rata Portion) the number of Escrow Shares
retained in escrow as a result of such claim(s) following the resolution of
such claim(s) and not released to Parent. Any Escrow Shares received by
Parent as an indemnification payment shall be promptly cancelled by Parent
after its receipt thereof.

  



  

11.4   _Payment of Indemnification_. In the event that Parent is entitled to
indemnification for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent's sole
and exclusive remedy for such Losses shall be the recovery of a number of
Parent Class A Shares from the then-remaining Escrow Shares having a
value equal to the Losses that have been finally determined to be owing to
Parent in accordance with this ___ARTICLE XI_ (at an assumed value equal to
the Escrow Share Value per Escrow Share), in each case, subject to the
limitations set forth in this ___ARTICLE XI_. Any payments to Parent from the
Escrow Shares (a) is intended to comply with, and shall be effected in
accordance with, Rev. Proc. 84-42, 1984-1 C.B. 521 and (b) shall be
treated as a reduction in the number of Parent Class A Shares issued to the
Escrow Participants for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local, and
foreign) income Tax purposes except to the extent otherwise required pursuant
to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or with respect to any
amounts treated as imputed interest under Section 483 of the Code.

  



  

11.5   _Insurance_. In calculating amounts of Losses payable to an
Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be
determined net of amounts actually recovered by the applicable Indemnified
Party under any insurance policy or other third party reimbursement actually
received.

  



  

11.6   _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. The representations and
warranties of the Company shall survive until twelve (12) months (the "
_Survival Period_ ") following the Closing. The covenants of the Company
contained in this Agreement to be performed prior to Closing shall expire and
be of no further force or effect as of the Closing; _provided_ that, if any
claim for breach or nonfulfillment may be asserted at any time prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period as set forth in this _Section 11.6_. The
indemnification to which any Indemnified Party is entitled from the
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to _Section 11.1_ for Losses shall be effective
so long as it is asserted prior to the expiration of the Survival Period (for
the avoidance of doubt, any claim set forth in an Indemnification Notice shall
be deemed asserted upon delivery of such Indemnification Notice); _provided_
that in the event that any Indemnification Notice shall have been given in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement prior to the expiration of
the Survival Period and such claim has not been finally resolved by the
expiration of the Survival Period, the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations that are the subject of such Indemnifications
Notice shall survive solely for purposes of resolving such claim until such
matters are finally resolved. The parties acknowledge that the time periods
set forth in this _Section 11.6 _for the assertion of claims under this
Agreement are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties
without regard to the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such
matters and that the twenty (20) year statute of limitations contemplated by
Title 10 of Section 8106(c) of the Delaware Code shall not apply to this
Agreement.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

11.7   _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this
___ARTICLE XI_ and the rights to enforce the Additional Agreements in
accordance with their terms shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Indemnified Parties, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to
any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except nothing in this
Agreement (a) will limit the parties' rights to seek injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies, (b) shall prevent Parent from bringing an action
for fraud (with scienter) against the Person who committed such Fraud (with
scienter) or (c) limit the right of any Person to pursue remedies under any
Additional Agreement against the parties thereto.

  



  

ARTICLE XII

12.1   _Arbitration_.

  



  

(a)  The parties shall promptly submit any dispute, claim, or controversy

enforcement of this Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any
action in tort, contract, equity, or otherwise), to binding arbitration before
one arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). Binding arbitration shall be the sole
means of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect,
validity, termination, interpretation, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any claim in tort,
contract, equity, or otherwise).

written decision, setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law,
within sixty (60) days after he shall have been selected. The
Arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive or other exemplary

discovery to the same extent as would be provided under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to any

Arbitrator shall limit any discovery or evidence such that his decision shall
be rendered within the period referred to in _Section 12.1(c)_.

59

 



    



  

(g)   The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to
confirm any arbitration award or to obtain relief as provided in _Section
12.1(h)_, as applicable (including actual attorneys' fees and costs), shall
be borne by the unsuccessful party (if the Stockholders' Representative, then
solely on behalf of the Company Securityholders) and shall be awarded as part
of the Arbitrator's decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise allocate
such costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h)  Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly
consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in
Delaware, to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to render any
provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or in aid of
the arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and subject
matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be
submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the parties hereto shall challenge
any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to such
arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent from such
arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have been the
subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(i)  The parties (in the case of the Stockholders' Representative, solely on
behalf of the Company Securityholders) shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any
experts employed by the Arbitrator and hold them harmless from and against any
claim or demand arising out of any arbitration under this Agreement or any
agreement contemplated hereby, unless resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the person indemnified.

  



  

(j)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. The parties expressly consent to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in Delaware to render
such relief and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.

(a)  THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE

legal consequences and import of such waiver with legal counsel. Each of the

hereunder has not occurred by April 15, 2021 (the "Outside Closing Date")
(provided that, if the SEC has not declared the Proxy Statement/Form S-4

(b)  In the event (i) an Authority shall have issued an Order, having the

without liability to the other party.

  



  

13.2   _Termination Upon Default_.

  



  

(a)  Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to the Company at
any time prior to the Closing, without prejudice to any rights or obligations
Parent or Merger Sub may have, if: (i) (x) the Company shall have breached any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein which has
rendered or would render the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth
in  _Section 10.2_ impossible and (y) such breach cannot be cured or is
not be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date and thirty (30) days
following receipt by the Company of a written notice from Parent describing
in reasonable detail the nature of such breach; or (ii) evidence that the

Deadline or (B) after such evidence has been delivered to Parent).

  



  

(b)  The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to Parent at

agreements, representations, and warranties contained herein, which has
rendered or would render the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth
in _Section  10.3_ impossible; and (ii) such breach cannot be cured or is not
be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date and thirty (30) days

force or effect, without any liability on the part of any party (or any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other party hereto or any other Person;
_provided_ that, no such termination shall relieve any party from liability
incurred as a result of the willful breach by such party of this Agreement or
such party's fraud, in which case such party shall be fully liable for any
and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of such breach or fraud. The provisions of _Section 9.2_,
___ARTICLE _ XII, this _Section 13.3_ and ___ARTICLE XIV_ shall survive any

14.2   _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision
hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the
particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party
or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise
required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with respect
to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other right or
remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect to such
breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to any
other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no shall any
party seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages
under any tort, contract, equity or other legal theory with respect to any
breach (or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any
matter otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

14.3   _Arm 's Length Bargaining; No Presumption Against Drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel and having participated in the drafting
of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other special
relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made
based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

14.4   _Publicity_. Except as required by law or applicable stock exchange
rules and except with respect to the Additional Parent SEC Documents, the
parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall issue any press release
or make any other public disclosure concerning the transactions contemplated
hereunder without the prior approval of the other party hereto. If a party is
required to make such a disclosure as required by law or applicable stock
exchange rules, the party making such determination will, if practicable in
the circumstances, use reasonable commercial efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such disclosure in advance of its issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following Closing and the public announcement
(if any) of the Merger, the Stockholders' Representative shall be permitted
to publicly announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Stockholders'
Representative in connection herewith as long as such announcement does not
disclose any of the other terms hereof.

14.5   _Expenses_. The anticipated costs and expenses of the Company in
connection with any merger, consolidation or business combination, including
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as of the Closing Date
as set forth on _Schedule 14.5_ shall be paid by Parent after the Closing. If
the Closing does not take place, each party (in the case of the
Stockholders' Representative, solely on behalf of the Company
Securityholders) shall be responsible for its own expenses.

  



  

14.6   _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or
delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation,
operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of the other party.
Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in
addition to constituting a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

14.7   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

14.8   _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted
(including scanned .pdf image) signature pages that together (but need not
individually) bear the signatures of all other parties.

  



  

14.9   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Additional
Agreements, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether
written or oral), all of which are merged herein. No provision of this
Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by any
agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of
conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or
in any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to
the effectiveness of any provision hereof or thereof.

  



  

14.10   _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is legally
invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or cause
such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so held
to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

14.11   _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the
scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

14.12   _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 9.3_, 
_ARTICLE XI_ and _Section 14.15_, neither this Agreement nor any
provision hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any
Person not a signatory hereto.

  



  

14.13   _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of Parent, dated
August 13, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company has read the Prospectus
and understands that Parent has established the Trust Account for the benefit
of the public shareholders of Parent and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant
to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a portion of the interest earned
on the amounts held in the Trust Account, Parent may disburse monies from the
Trust Account only for the purposes set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and
in consideration of Parent agreeing to enter into this Agreement, each of the
Company and the Stockholders' Representative, for itself and on behalf of the
Company Securityholders, hereby agrees that it does not now and shall not at
any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to any monies in the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, any
negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent and hereby agrees that it
will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason.

14.14   _Stockholders ' Representative_. By virtue of the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Company Securityholder shall be deemed to have appointed the designation of,
and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the
Stockholders' Representative for all purposes in connection with this
Agreement and any agreement ancillary hereto, including (a) to give and
receive notices and communications to Parent for any purpose under this
Agreement and the Additional Agreements; (b) to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of and demand arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any
indemnification claims (including Third-Party Claims) under _Section  11.1_
or, following the Closing, other disputes arising under or related to
this Agreement; (c) to enter into and deliver the Escrow Agreement on behalf
of each of the Company Securityholders; (d) to authorize or object to
delivery to Parent of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction
of indemnification claims by Parent in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement; (e) to act on behalf of Company Securityholders in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, the securities described
herein and any other document or instrument executed in connection with the
Agreement and the Merger; and (f) to take all actions necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of the Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing. The Stockholders' Representative may resign at any time. Such
agency may be changed by the Company Securityholders from time to time upon
no less than twenty (20) days' prior written notice to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Stockholders' Representative may not be removed unless
holders of a majority of the Company Securities (on an as converted or
exercised basis) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time agree to
such removal. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholders' Representative may
be filled by approval of the holders of a majority of the Company Securities
(on an as converted or exercised basis) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders'
Representative. The Stockholders' Representative will incur no liability of
any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholders'
Representative in connection with the Stockholders' Representative's services
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreement ancillary hereto, except in
the event of liability directly resulting from the Stockholders'
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the
advice of counsel. The Company Securityholders will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Stockholders' Representative from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,
fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholders' Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreement ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders' Representative will reimburse
the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative
Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholders' Representative
by the Company Securityholders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Stockholders' Representative from (i) the funds in the
Expense Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company
Securityholders; _provided _ that, while this provision allows the
Stockholders' Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative from seeking
any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Stockholders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Company Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company Securityholders set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Stockholders' Representative under this _Section
14.14_. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation
or removal of the Stockholders' Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. Upon the Closing, the Company will wire $150,000 (the " _Expense
Fund_ ") to the Stockholders' Representative, which will be used for the
purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Representative
for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto. The Company Securityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholders' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders' Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders' Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Stockholders' Representative's
responsibilities, the Stockholders' Representative will deliver any remaining
balance of the Expense Fund to the Company. For Tax purposes, the Expense
Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Company at the time of Closing.

dispute, claim or controversy based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought only against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement with
respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer,

to this Agreement (which Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of

tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for
any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations or liabilities of such named party or for any dispute,
claim or controversy based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, provided, that this _Section 14.15_
shall not apply to _Section  14.14_, which shall be enforceable by the
Stockholders' Representative in its entirety against the Company
Securityholders.

effect to such merger, becoming a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and each

the Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, each Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the number

WHEREAS, in consideration for the benefits to be received by each Stockholder
under the terms of the Merger Agreement and as a material inducement to
Parent and the other Parent Parties agreeing to enter into and consummate the

WHEREAS, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent and the other Parent
Parties would not have entered into and agreed to consummate the transactions

this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by the agreements, covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises set
forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, each intending to
be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

AGREEMENT

  



  

1.   _Company Stockholder Consent and Related Matters_.

  



  

(a)  (1) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) following the Effective Date, each Stockholder shall duly
execute and deliver to the Company and Parent the Company Stockholder Written
Consent under which it shall irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the
matters, actions and proposals contemplated by Section 8.3(a)
(Company Stockholder Approval) of the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the first sentence of this _Section 1(a)_ , prior to the
Closing, each Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject
Company Shares against and withhold consent with respect to any Alternative
Proposal. (2) In addition to the foregoing, each Stockholder hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, at any meeting of the holders of
Company Capital Stock (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), such
Stockholder shall, if a meeting is held, appear at the meeting, in person or
by proxy, or otherwise cause its Subject Company Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum, and such Stockholder
shall vote or provide consent (or cause to be voted or consented), in person
or by proxy, all of its Subject Company Shares:

  



  

(i)  to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger;

  



  

(ii)  in any other circumstances upon which a consent or other approval is
required under the organizational documents of the Company or otherwise
sought with respect to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, to vote, consent or approve (or cause to be voted, consented or
approved) all of such Stockholder's Subject Company Shares held at such
time in favor thereof;

  



  

(iii)  against any Alternative Transaction, or any other merger agreement,
merger, consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or
by the Company (other than the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby); and

  



  

(iv)  against any proposal, action or agreement that would (A) impede,
frustrate, prevent or nullify any provision of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the Merger, (B) result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation, warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or (C) result in any of the conditions
set forth in Article X of the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Parent, each
Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent or any individual designated
by Parent as the Stockholder's agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy (with full
power of substitution and resubstituting), for and in the name, place and
stead of the Stockholder, to attend on behalf of the Stockholder any meeting
of the holders of Company Capital Stock with respect to the matters described
in _Section 1(a)_ , to include the Subject Company Shares in any
computation for purposes of establishing a quorum at any such meeting of the
holders of Company Capital Stock, to vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject
Company Shares or consent (or withhold consent) with respect to any of the
matters described in _Section 1(a)_  in connection with any meeting of the
holders of Company Capital Stock or any action by written consent by the
holders of Company Capital Stock (including the Company Stockholder Written
Consent), in each case, in the event that the Stockholder fails to
timely perform or otherwise comply with the covenants, agreements or
obligations set forth in _Section 1(a)_.

  



  

(c)  The proxy granted by each Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1(b)_ is
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy
and is granted in consideration for Parent entering into the Merger Agreement
and agreeing to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The proxy
granted by each Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1(b)_ is also a
durable proxy and shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death,
incapacity or other inability to act by each Stockholder and shall revoke any
and all prior proxies granted by each Stockholder with respect to the Subject
Company Shares. The vote or consent of the proxyholder in accordance with
_Section 1(b)_ and with respect to the matters in _Section 1(a)_ shall control
in the event of any conflict between such vote or consent by the proxyholder
of the Subject Company Shares and a vote or consent by each Stockholder of
the Subject Company Shares (or any other Person with the power to vote the
Subject Company Shares) with respect to the matters in _Section 1(a)_. The
proxyholder may not exercise the proxy granted pursuant to _Section 1(b) _ on
any matter except those provided in _Section 1(a)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Stockholder may vote the Subject Company Shares on all other
matters, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, the other applicable
covenants, agreements and obligations set forth in this Agreement.

(d)  Each Stockholder hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
rights of appraisal, dissenter's rights and any similar rights relating to
the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the parties of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, that such Stockholder may have
under applicable law (including Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law or otherwise), (ii) consents to, on behalf of itself, and
each other holder of Company Preferred Stock and irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any and all rights such Stockholder may have with
respect to, (x) the conversion of all outstanding shares of Company Preferred
Stock into shares of Company Common Stock, with such conversion to be in
accordance with the terms of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (y)
prior to the Closing, the conversion of each Convertible Note into Company
Series B Preferred Stock, in accordance with the terms of each Convertible
Note, in each case, as set forth on the Capitalization Table.

  



  

(e)  Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably waives, on behalf of themselves and
each other holder of Company Preferred Stock, its right to certain payments
upon liquidation of the Company pursuant to Article IV, Section 2 of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation,

  



  

2.   _Other Covenants and Agreements_.

  



  

(a)  Each Stockholder hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in any such agreement, (i) each of the agreements set forth on
_Schedule II_ hereto shall be automatically terminated and of no further force
and effect (including any provisions of any such agreement that, by its
terms, survive such termination) effective as of, and subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Closing and (ii) upon such
termination neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates (including from and
after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates) shall have any further
obligations or liabilities under each such agreement; _provided_ , however,
that the indemnification provisions that are contemplated to survive the
agreement marked with an asterisk (*) on _Schedule II_ shall survive such
termination in accordance with their terms. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Stockholder hereby agrees to promptly execute and deliver
all additional agreements, documents and instruments and take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary or reasonably advisable in order to achieve the
purpose of the preceding sentence.

  



  

(b)  Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that Parent and the other
Parent Parties are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the
Stockholder entering into this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and
perform, or otherwise comply with, as applicable, the agreements, covenants
and obligations contained in this Agreement and but for the Stockholder
entering into this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and perform, or
otherwise comply with, as applicable, the agreements, covenants
and obligations contained in this Agreement, Parent and the other Parent
Parties would not have entered into or agreed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(c)  On the Closing Date, each Stockholder shall deliver to Parent a duly
executed copy of that (i) certain Registration Rights Agreement, by and among
Parent, the Company and the Specified Company Securityholders party thereto,
in substantially the form attached as Exhibit F to the Merger Agreement and
(ii) certain Voting Agreement, by and among Parent, the Company and the
Specified Company Securityholders party thereto, in substantially the form
attached as Exhibit D to the Merger Agreement.

3\. _Stockholder Representations and Warranties_. Each Stockholder represents
and warrants to Parent as follows:

  



  

(a)  If Stockholder is not an individual, the Stockholder is a corporation,
limited liability company or other applicable business entity duly organized
or formed, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing (or the
equivalent thereof, if applicable, in each case, with respect to the
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing or any equivalent
thereof) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of formation or organization (as
applicable).

  



  

(b)  If Stockholder is not an individual, the Stockholder has the requisite
corporate, limited liability company or other similar power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its covenants, agreements and
obligations hereunder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder that relate to the provisions
of the Merger Agreement), and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate (or other similar) action on the part of such
Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by such Stockholder and constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of
each Stockholder (assuming that this Agreement is duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Parent), enforceable against each such Stockholder in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the
enforcement of creditors' rights and subject to general principles of
equity).

  



  

(c)  No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or
filing with, any governmental authority is required on the part of any
Stockholder with respect to such Stockholder's execution, delivery or
performance of its covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements and
obligations under this Agreement that relate to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement) or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for any consents, approvals, authorizations, designations,
declarations, waivers or filings, the absence of which would not
adversely affect the ability of such Stockholder to perform, or otherwise
comply with, any of its covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder in any
material respect.

  



  

(d)  None of the execution or delivery of this Agreement by each Stockholder,
the performance by such Stockholder of any of its covenants, agreements or
obligations under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement that relate to the
provisions of the Merger Agreement) or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will, directly or indirectly (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) (i) result in any breach of any
provision of such Stockholder's organizational documents, (ii) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute a default or give rise to any right of
termination, consent, cancellation, amendment, modification, suspension,
revocation or acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract to which such Stockholder is a party, (iii) violate, or
constitute a breach under, any Order or applicable Law to which such
Stockholder or any of its properties or assets are bound or (iv) result in
the creation of any Lien upon the Subject Company Shares, except, in the case
of any of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_  directly above, as would not adversely
affect the ability of such Stockholder to perform, or otherwise comply with,
any of its covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder in any material
respect.

  



  

(e)  Each Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the Subject
Company Shares and has valid, good and marketable title to the Subject
Company Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than transfer restrictions
under applicable Securities Law). Except for the shares of Company Capital
Stock set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto, together with any other shares of
Company Capital Stock or other equity interest (including anything
convertible into such equity interests) of the Company that the
Stockholder acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date hereof,
such Stockholder has the sole right to vote (and provide consent in respect
of, as applicable) the Subject Company Shares and, except for this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement and that certain Second Amended and Restated Voting
Agreement, dated September 26, 2019, such Stockholder is not party to or bound
by (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, or other Contract that would
(either alone or in connection with one or more events, developments
(including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions precedent)) require
such Stockholder to Transfer (as defined below) any of the Subject Company
Shares or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the
voting or Transfer of any of the Subject Company Shares.

(f)  There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Stockholder's knowledge,
threatened against such Stockholder that questions the beneficial or record
ownership of such Stockholder's Subject Company Shares, the validity of this
Agreement or the performance by such Stockholder of its obligations under
this Agreement, or which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
ability of such Stockholder to perform, or otherwise comply with, any of its
covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect.

  



  

(g)  The Stockholder, on his, her or its own behalf and on behalf of his, her
or its Representatives, acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees that
(i) he, she or it has conducted his, her or its own independent review and
analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of, the
Parent Parties and (ii) he, she or it has been furnished with or given access
to such documents and information about the Parent Parties and
their respective businesses and operations as he, she or it and his, her or
its Representatives have deemed necessary to enable him, her or it to make an
informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the other Additional Agreements to which he, she or it is or
will be a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

(h)  In entering into this Agreement and the other Additional Agreements to
which he, she or it is or will be a party, the Stockholder has relied solely
on his, her or its own investigation and analysis and the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in the Additional Agreements to which he, she
or it is or will be a party and no other representations or warranties of any
Parent Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the
representations or warranties of any Parent Party set forth in the
Merger Agreement or any other Additional Agreements), any Affiliate of Parent
or any other Person, either express or implied, and such Stockholder, on his,
her or its own behalf and on behalf of his, her or its Representatives,
acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in the Additional
Agreements to which he, she or it is or will be a party, none of the Parent
Parties, any Affiliate of Parent or any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, in connection with or
related to this Agreement, the Additional Agreements to which he, she or it
is or will be a party or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

4.   _Transfer of Subject Securities_. Except as expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement or with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), from and after the date hereof, each Stockholder agrees not to (a) Transfer any of the Subject Company Shares, (b) enter into (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, or other Contract that would (either alone or in connection with one or more events or developments (including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions precedent)) require such Stockholder to Transfer the Subject Company Shares or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the voting or Transfer of the Subject Company Shares, or (c) take any actions (i) having the effect of preventing or disabling such Stockholder from performing its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) in furtherance of any of the matters described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ or _(b)_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Transfer_ " means any, direct or indirect, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, mortgage, exchange, hypothecation, grant of a security interest in or disposition or encumbrance of an interest (whether with or without consideration, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law or otherwise).

5.   _Termination_. This Agreement shall automatically terminate, without any notice or other action by any Party, and be void _ab initio_ upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time; (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (c) upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and each Stockholder. Upon termination of this Agreement as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, none of the Parties shall have any further obligations or Liabilities under, or with respect to, this Agreement.

  



  

6.   _Fiduciary Duties_.

7.   _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly given) by delivery in person, by facsimile (having obtained electronic delivery confirmation thereof) if applicable, e-mail (having obtained electronic delivery confirmation thereof (i.e., an electronic record of the sender that the email was sent to the intended recipient thereof without an "error" or similar message that such email was not received by such intended recipient)), or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) (upon receipt thereof) to the other Parties as follows:

This Agreement, the Merger Agreement and documents referred to herein and therein constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

  



  

9.   _Amendments and Waivers; Assignment_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by each of Stockholder and Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that either Party does not perform its respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  



  

12.   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not intended, nor shall be construed, to give any Person, other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever by reason of this Agreement.

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

  



  

FS Development Corp.

  

600 Montgomery Street, Suite 4500

  

San Francisco, California 94111

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the proposed business combination (the " _Transaction_ ")
between FS Development Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _FSD_ "), and Gemini
Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Target_ "), pursuant to a
merger agreement to be entered into among FSD, Target, and the other parties
thereto (the " _Transaction Agreement_ "), FSD is seeking commitments from
interested investors to purchase shares of Class A common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the " _Shares_ "), of FSD, for a purchase price of $10.00
per share (the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ "). The aggregate purchase
price to be paid by the undersigned (the " _Investor_ ") for the subscribed
Shares (as set forth on the signature page hereto) is referred to herein as
the " _Subscription Amount_." On or about the date of this Subscription
Agreement, FSD is entering into subscription agreements (the " _Other
Subscription Agreements_ " and together with this Subscription Agreement, the
" _Subscription Agreements_ ") with certain other investors (the " _Other
Investors_ " and together with the Investor, the " _Investors_ "), severally
and not jointly, pursuant to which the Investors, severally and not jointly,
have agreed to purchase on the closing date of the Transaction, inclusive of
the Shares subscribed for by the Investor, an aggregate amount of up to
9,500,000 Shares, at a per share price equal to the Per Share Purchase Price.

  



  

In connection therewith, and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions, set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Investor and FSD
agree as follows:

  



  

1.   _Subscription_. The Investor hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from FSD at the Closing (as defined herein) the number of Shares set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein.

  



  

2.   _Closing_. The closing of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and substantially concurrently with and conditioned upon the effectiveness of the Transaction and immediately after the Merger (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). Upon (i) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Section 2 and _Section 3_ of this Subscription Agreement and (ii) delivery of written notice from (or on behalf of) FSD to the Investor (the " _Closing Notice_ ") that FSD reasonably expects all conditions to the closing of the Transaction to be satisfied or waived on a date that is not less than five (5) business days from the date on which the Closing Notice is delivered to the undersigned (the " _Closing Date_ "), the Investor shall deliver to FSD on the Closing Date the Subscription Amount by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by FSD in the Closing Notice (which account shall not be an escrow account) against delivery by FSD to the Investor on the Closing Date (A) the number of Shares set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement in book entry form, free and clear of any liens or other restrictions (other than those arising under applicable securities laws), in the name of the Investor (or its nominee in accordance with its delivery instructions) or to a custodian designated by the Investor, as applicable, and (B) evidence from FSD's transfer agent evidencing the issuance to the Investor of such Shares on and as of the Closing Date. If the closing of the Transaction does not occur within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, FSD shall promptly (but not later than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date) return the funds so delivered by the Investor to FSD by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Investor. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, "business day" shall mean any day other than (a) any Saturday or Sunday or (b) any other day on which commercial banks in New York, New York and Boston, Massachusetts are open for the general transaction of business.

of the Shares pursuant to this Subscription Agreement is subject to the
following conditions:

  



  

(i)  no applicable governmental authority shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any judgment, order, law, rule or regulation
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has
the effect of making consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise restraining or prohibiting consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

(ii)  no suspension of the qualification of the Shares for the offering or
sale or trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or, to FSD's knowledge,
initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes, shall
have occurred prior to the Closing;

  



  

(iii)  all conditions precedent to the closing of the Transaction shall have
been satisfied (as determined by the parties to the Transaction Agreement) or
waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the closing of the Transaction); and

  



  

(iv)  the Shares shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital
Market.

  



  

(b)  The obligation of FSD to consummate the issuance and sale of the Shares
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement shall be subject to the condition
that all representations and warranties of the Investor contained in this
Subscription Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (other
than representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect, which representations and warranties shall be true
in all respects), at and as of the Closing Date, and consummation of the
Closing shall constitute a reaffirmation by the Investor of each of the
representations warranties, covenants and agreements of the Investor
contained in this Subscription Agreement as of the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)  The obligation of the Investor to consummate the purchase of the Shares
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement shall be subject to the following
conditions:

  



  

(i)  all representations and warranties of FSD contained in this Subscription
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (other than
representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein), which representations and
warranties shall be true in all respects) at and as of the Closing Date, and
consummation of the Closing shall constitute a reaffirmation by FSD of each
of the representations and warranties of FSD contained in this
Subscription Agreement as of the Closing Date;

  



  

(ii)  FSD shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material
respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by this

a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
the economic benefits that the Investor or FSD would reasonably expect to
receive under this Subscription Agreement; and

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(iv)  there shall have been no amendment, waiver or modification to the Other
Subscription Agreements that materially economically benefits the Other
Investors thereunder unless the Investor has been offered substantially the
same benefits.

  



  

4.   _Further Assurances_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take such additional actions as the parties reasonably may deem to be practical and necessary in order to consummate the subscription as contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

5.   _FSD Representations and Warranties_. FSD represents and warrants to the Investor, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date that:

  



  

(a)  FSD has been duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as presently
conducted and to enter into, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Subscription Agreement.

  



  

(b)  As of the Closing Date, the Shares will be duly authorized and, when
issued and delivered to the Investor against full payment therefor in
accordance with the terms of this Subscription Agreement, the Shares will be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not have been issued
in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar rights created under
FSD's certificate of incorporation (as amended to the Closing Date) or under
the laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

(c)  This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by FSD and, assuming that this Subscription Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of the Investor, this Subscription Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of FSD and is enforceable against
FSD in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited or otherwise
affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  



  

(d)  The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the issuance
and sale of the Shares and the compliance by FSD with all of the provisions
of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation
of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon
any of the property or assets of FSD or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement,
lease, license or other agreement or instrument to which FSD or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which FSD or any of its subsidiaries is bound or
to which any of the property or assets of FSD is subject that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of FSD and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or materially and adversely affect: (A) the ability of
FSD to consummate the Transaction; (B) the validity of the Shares; or (C) the
legal authority of FSD to comply in all material respects with the terms of
this Subscription Agreement (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ "); (ii) result in
any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of FSD; or
(iii) result in any violation of any statute or any judgment, order, rule or
regulation of any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
having jurisdiction over FSD or any of their properties that would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially affect the
validity of the Shares or the legal authority of FSD to comply in all
material respects with this Subscription Agreement.

(e)  FSD has made all filings required to be filed by it with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "). As of their respective
dates, all reports, the Registration Statement of FSD filed on Form S-1 dated
July 24, 2020 (as amended), and the prospectus of FSD dated August 11, 2020
(the " _SEC Reports_ ") required to be filed or actually filed by FSD with
the SEC complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the " _Securities Act_ ") and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and none of the SEC
Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of FSD
included in the SEC Reports comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto as in effect at the time of filing and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition of FSD as of and for the dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments. A
copy of each SEC Report is available to the Investor via the SEC's EDGAR
system. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received by FSD from the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the
SEC with respect to any of the SEC Reports.

  



  

(f)  FSD has not entered into any side letter or similar agreement with any
Other Investor or any other investor in connection with such Other Investor's
or other investor's direct or indirect investment in FSD other than the Other
Subscription Agreement and the Transaction Agreement. No Other Subscription
Agreement contains terms (economic or otherwise) more favorable to such Other
Investor or investor than as set forth in this Subscription Agreement. The
Other Subscription Agreements have not been amended in any material respect
following the date of this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

(g)  FSD is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or
order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any
court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority, self-
regulatory organization or other person in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by FSD of this Subscription Agreement (including,
without limitation, the issuance of the Shares), other than (i) filings with
the SEC, (ii) filings required by applicable state securities laws,
(iii) filings required by The Nasdaq Capital Market, or such other applicable
stock exchange on which FSD's Class A common stock is then listed (the "
_Stock Exchange_ "), and (iv) the failure of which to obtain would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. FSD is in compliance with all applicable laws and rules
of The Nasdaq Capital Market.

  



  

(h)  The authorized capital stock of FSD consists of 100,000,000 Shares of
which 12,516,500 are outstanding, 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share of which 3,018,750 are issued and outstanding, and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, none of
which are issued and outstanding. No other shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of FSD are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
All issued and outstanding Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right
or any similar right under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, FSD's organizational documents or any contract to which FSD is a party
or by which FSD is bound. Except as set forth in FSD's
organizational documents, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of
FSD to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or any capital
equity of FSD. There are no securities or instruments issued by or to which
FSD is a party containing anti-dilution or similar provisions that will be
triggered by the issuance of (i) the Shares pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement or (ii) the shares to be issued pursuant to any Other Subscription
Agreement. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of FSD to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any other person or entity.

(i)  The issued and outstanding Shares are registered pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act, and are listed for trading on the Stock Exchange.
There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of FSD, threatened against FSD by Nasdaq or the SEC to deregister
the Shares or prohibit or terminate the listing of the Shares on Nasdaq. FSD
has taken no action that is designed to terminate the registration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(j)  Assuming the accuracy of the Investor's representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 6_ , no registration under the Securities Act is
required for the offer and sale of the Shares by FSD to the Investor
hereunder. The Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner
involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

  



  

(k)  Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
there is no (i) action, suit, claim or other proceeding, in each case by or
before any governmental authority pending, or, to the knowledge of FSD,
threatened against FSD or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order
of any governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding against FSD.

  



  

(l)  FSD has not received any written communication from a governmental
authority that alleges that FSD is not in compliance with or is in default or
violation of any applicable law, except where such non-compliance, default or
violation would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(m)  FSD is not under any obligation to pay any broker's fee or commission in
connection with the sale of the Shares hereunder other than to the Placement
Agents (as defined herein).

  



  

(n)  FSD acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Shares may be pledged by Investor in connection with a bona
fide margin agreement, which shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or
assignment of the Shares hereunder, and the Investor effecting a pledge of
Shares shall not be required to provide FSD with any notice thereof or
otherwise make any delivery to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement. The
Investor hereby agrees to execute and deliver such documentation as a pledgee
of the Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge of the Shares
to such pledgee by the Investor.

promulgated under the Securities Act until at least one year from the date
that FSD files a Current Report on Form 8-K following the Closing Date that
includes the "Form 10" information required under applicable SEC rules and
regulations. The Investor understands that it has been advised to consult
legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, transfer, pledge or
disposition of any of the Shares.

  



  

(c)  The Investor understands and agrees that the Investor is purchasing the
Shares from FSD. The Investor further acknowledges that there have been no
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made to the Investor by
FSD, Target or their respective officers or directors, expressly or by
implication, other than those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements included in this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

(d)  The Investor's acquisition and holding of the Shares will not constitute
or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, Section 4975 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any applicable similar law.

  



  

(e)  The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor has received such
information as the Investor deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Shares, including with respect to FSD, Target or
the Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Investor acknowledges that he, she or it has carefully reviewed the SEC
Reports and any disclosure documents used in the offering of the Shares. The
Investor represents and agrees that the Investor and the
Investor's professional advisor(s), if any (i) have had the full opportunity
to ask such questions, receive such answers and obtain such information as
the Investor and such Investor's professional advisor(s), if any, have deemed
necessary to make an investment decision with respect to the Shares and (ii)
have independently made their own analysis and decision to invest in FSD.

  



  

(f)  The Investor became aware of this offering of the Shares solely by means
of direct contact between the Investor and FSD, Target, or a representative
of FSD or Target, and the Shares were offered to the Investor solely by direct
contact between the Investor and FSD, Target, or a representative of FSD or
Target. The Investor did not become aware of this offering of the Shares, nor
were the Shares offered to the Investor, by any other means. The Investor
acknowledges that the Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner
involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws. Investor acknowledges that it
is not relying upon, and has not relied upon, any statement, representation
or warranty made by any person, firm or corporation (including, without
limitation, Target, FSD, Jefferies LLC or SVB Leerink LLC (each a " _Placement
Agent_ ", and together, the " _Placement Agents_ ") or their respective
affiliates or any of their or their respective affiliates' control persons,
officers, directors, employees or representatives), other than the
representations and warranties of FSD contained in Section 5 of this
Subscription Agreement, in making its investment or decision to invest in FSD.

  



  

(g)  The Investor acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial
risks incident to the purchase and ownership of the Shares, including those
set forth in FSD's filings with the SEC. The Investor has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Shares, and the Investor
has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as the Investor has
considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(h)  Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), the Investor has
adequately analyzed and fully considered the risks of an investment in the
Shares and determined that the Shares are a suitable investment for the
Investor and that the Investor is able at this time and in the foreseeable
future to bear the economic risk of a total loss of the Investor's
investment in FSD.

  



  

(i)  In making its decision to purchase the Shares, the Investor has relied
solely upon independent investigation made by the Investor. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Investor has not relied on any statements
or other information provided by or on behalf of the Placement Agents or any
of their respective affiliates or any of their or their respective
affiliates' control persons, officers, directors, employees or
representatives concerning FSD, Target, the Transaction, the Transaction
Agreement, this Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, the Shares or the offer and sale of the Shares.

  



  

(j)  The Investor understands and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Shares or made any
findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

  



  

(k)  The Investor has been duly formed or incorporated and is validly
existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or formation, with power and authority to enter into, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

(l)  The execution, delivery and performance by the undersigned of this
Subscription Agreement are within the powers of the Investor, have been duly
authorized and will not constitute or result in a breach or default under or
conflict with any order, ruling or regulation of any court or other tribunal
or of any governmental commission or agency, or any agreement or other
undertaking, to which the undersigned is a party or by which the undersigned
is bound, and, if the undersigned is not an individual, will not violate any
provisions of the undersigned's charter documents, including, without
limitation, its incorporation or formation papers, bylaws, indenture of trust
or partnership or operating agreement, as may be applicable. The signature of
the Investor on this Subscription Agreement is genuine, and the signatory, if
the Investor is an individual, has legal competence and capacity to execute
the same or, if the Investor is not an individual, the signatory has been
duly authorized to execute the same, and assuming that this
Subscription Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of FSD,
this Subscription Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Investor, enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its
terms except as may be limited or otherwise affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  



  

(m)  The undersigned is not (i) a person or entity named on the List of

provided that the Investor is permitted to do so under applicable law. If the
Investor is a financial institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31
U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.) (the "BSA"), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act
of 2001 (the " _PATRIOT Act_ "), and its implementing regulations
(collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), the Investor maintains policies
and procedures reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations under
the BSA/PATRIOT Act. To the extent required, it maintains policies and
procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the
OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List. To the extent required by
applicable law, the Investor maintains policies and procedures reasonably

(n)  No disclosure or offering document has been prepared by either of the
Placement Agents or any of their respective affiliates in connection with the
offer and sale of the Shares.

  



  

(o)  Neither the Placement Agents nor any of their respective directors,

independent investigation with respect to FSD or the Shares or the accuracy,
completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the Investor by FSD.

  



  

(p)  In connection with the issue and purchase of the Shares, the Placement
Agents have not acted as the Investor's financial advisor or fiduciary.

consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement.

acting as FSD's placement agents or financial advisors and certain of the
Placement Agents are acting as financial advisor to Target in connection with
the Transaction.

  



  

7.   _Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a)  In the event that the Shares are not registered in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction, FSD agrees that, within thirty (30) calendar
days after the consummation of the Transaction (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), it
will file with the SEC (at the its sole cost and expense) a registration
statement registering the resale of such Shares (the "
_Registration Statement_ "), and it shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as
practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (1) the
90th calendar day after the consummation of the Transaction (or 120th
calendar day if the SEC notifies FSD that it will "review" the
Registration Statement) and (2) the fifth business day after the date FSD is
notified in writing by the SEC that the Registration Statement will not be
"reviewed" or will not be subject to further review (the " _Effectiveness
Date_ "). FSD agrees to cause such Registration Statement, or another shelf
registration statement that includes the Shares to be sold pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement, to remain effective, except for such times as FSD is
permitted hereunder to suspend the use of the prospectus forming part of the
Registration Statement, until the earliest of (i) the third anniversary of the
Closing, (ii) the date on which the Investor ceases to hold any Shares issued
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, or (iii) on the first date on which
the Investor can sell all of its Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement (or shares received in exchange therefor) under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act without volume or manner of sale limitations and without the
requirement for FSD to be in compliance with the current public information
required under Rule 144(c)(2) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable).
The Investor agrees to disclose its beneficial ownership as determined in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act to FSD upon request to assist
it in making the determination described above. In no event shall the Investor
be identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement unless
requested by the SEC; _provided_ , that if the SEC requests that
the Investor be identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration
Statement, the Investor will have an opportunity to withdraw its Shares from
the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents
FSD from including any or all of the shares proposed to be registered under
the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 of the
Securities Act for the resale of the Shares by the applicable shareholders or
otherwise, such Registration Statement shall register for resale such number
of Shares which is equal to the maximum number of Shares as is permitted by
the SEC. In such event, the number of Shares to be registered for each
selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro
rata among all such selling shareholders. FSD's obligations to include the
Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in
exchange therefor) for resale in the Registration Statement are contingent
upon the Investor furnishing in writing to FSD such information regarding the
Investor, the securities of FSD held by the Investor and the intended method
of disposition of such Shares as shall be reasonably requested by FSD to
effect the registration of such Shares, and shall execute such documents in
connection with such registration as FSD may reasonably request that are
customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations, including providing
that FSD shall be entitled to postpone and suspend the effectiveness or use of
the Registration Statement during any customary blackout period or similar
period or as permitted hereunder. Investor shall not be entitled to use the
Registration Statement for an underwritten offering. For purposes of
clarification, any failure by FSD to file the Registration Statement by the
Filing Deadline or to effect such Registration Statement by the Effectiveness
Date shall not otherwise relieve FSD of its obligations to file or effect the
Registration Statement set forth in this Section 7. For as long as the
Registration Statement shall remain effective pursuant to this Section 7(a),
FSD will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) qualify the Shares
for listing on the Stock Exchange, and (2) update or amend the Registration
Statement as necessary to include the Shares. For as long as the Investor
holds the Shares, FSD will use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) make and
keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined
in Rule 144, (B) file in a timely manner all reports and other documents with
the SEC required under the Exchange Act, as long as FSD remains subject to
such requirements, and (C) provide all customary and reasonable cooperation
necessary, in each case, to enable the undersigned to resell the Shares
pursuant to the Registration Statement or Rule 144 of the Securities Act
(when Rule 144 of the Securities Act becomes available to the Investor), as
applicable.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, FSD may delay
or postpone filing of such Registration Statement, and from time to time
require the Investor not to sell under the Registration Statement or suspend
the use or effectiveness of any such Registration Statement, if the board of
directors of FSD determines in good faith that either in order for the
Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission, an
amendment thereto would be needed, or if such filing or use could materially
affect a bona fide business or financing transaction of FSD or would require
premature disclosure of information that could materially adversely affect
FSD (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension Event_ "); provided, that, (I)
FSD shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of the Registration
Statement on more than two (2) occasions or for a period of more than ninety
(90) consecutive days or more than a total of one hundred-twenty (120)
calendar days, in each case in any three hundred sixty (360) day period and
(II) FSD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such Registration
Statement available for the sale by the undersigned of such securities as
soon as practicable thereafter. If so directed by FSD, the Investor
will deliver to FSD or, in the Investor's sole discretion destroy, all copies
of the prospectus covering the Shares in the Investor's possession;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies
of the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent the
Investor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (A) in order to
comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or (B) in accordance
with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies
stored electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-
up.

  



   

9

 



    



  

(c)  At its expense FSD shall advise the Investor within two (2) business
days: (i) when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has become effective; (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for such purpose; (iii) of the receipt by FSD of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Shares included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (iv) subject to the
provisions in this Subscription Agreement, of the occurrence of any event
that requires the making of any changes in any Registration Statement or
prospectus so that, as of such date, the statements therein are not
misleading and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading. Upon receipt of any written notice from FSD (which notice shall
not contain any material non-public information regarding FSD) of the
happening of any of the foregoing or of a Suspension Event during the period
that the Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a
Suspension Event the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the
prospectus) not misleading, the undersigned agrees that (1) it will
immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Shares under the Registration
Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to
Rule 144) until the undersigned receives copies of a supplemental or amended
prospectus (which FSD agrees to promptly prepare) that corrects the
misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any
post-effective amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by
FSD that it may resume such offers and sales, and (2) it will maintain the
confidentiality of any information included in such written notice delivered
by FSD except (A) for disclosure to the Investor's employees, agents and
professional advisers who need to know such information and are obligated to
keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order to
comply with reporting obligations to its limited partners who have agreed to
keep such information confidential and (C) as required by law or subpoena. FSD
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as soon as
reasonably practicable. Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated in
clauses (i) through (iv) above, except for such times as FSD is permitted
hereunder to suspend, and has suspended, the use of a prospectus forming part
of a Registration Statement, FSD shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
prospectus, or file any other required document so that, as
thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Shares included therein, such
prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(d)  For purposes of this Section 7, "Shares" shall mean, as of any date of
determination, the Shares acquired by the Investor pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement and any other equity security issued or issuable with
respect to such Shares by way of share split, dividend, distribution,
recapitalization, merger, exchange, replacement or similar event, and
"Investor" shall include any affiliate of the undersigned Investor to which
the rights under this Section 7 shall have been duly assigned.

  



  

(e)  FSD shall indemnify the Investor (to the extent a seller under the
Registration Statement), its officers, directors, partners, members,
managers, stockholders, advisers and agents, and each person who controls the
Investor (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_
"), as incurred, that arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or incorporated by reference therein), any prospectus included in the
Registration Statement or any form of prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or
relating to any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the
extent, that such untrue statements or alleged untrue statements,
omissions or alleged omissions are based upon information regarding the
Investor furnished in writing to FSD by the Investor expressly for use
therein or Investor omitted a material fact from such information.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(f)   Investor shall indemnify and hold harmless FSD, its directors,
officers, agents and employees, and each person who controls FSD (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange
Act), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all
Losses, as incurred, arising out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
any prospectus included in the Registration Statement, or any form of
prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, or any form of prospectus
or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statements or omissions are based upon information regarding the Investor
furnished in writing to FSD by the Investor expressly for use therein. In no
event shall the liability of Investor exceed the net proceeds received by the
Investor upon the sale of the Shares giving rise to such indemnification
obligation. The Investor shall notify FSD promptly of the institution, threat
or assertion of any proceeding arising from or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Section 7 of which the Investor is aware.

  



  

(g)  If the indemnification provided under this Section 7 from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by
a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to
above shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 7 and
deemed to include any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to
this Section 7 from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. Each indemnifying party's obligation to make a
contribution pursuant to this Section 7(g) shall be individual, not joint and
several, and in no event shall the liability of the Investor hereunder exceed
the net proceeds received by the Investor upon the sale of the Shares giving
rise to such indemnification obligation.

  



  

8.  Termination. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto to terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) if the consummation of the Transaction has not occurred on or before May 15, 2021; or (d) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 3_ of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied or waived, or are not capable of being satisfied, on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement will not be and are not consummated at the Closing; _provided_ that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from any such breach. FSD shall notify the Investor of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination of such agreement.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

9.   Trust Account Waiver. The Investor hereby acknowledges that FSD has established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of FSD's public stockholders and certain other parties (including the underwriters of the IPO). For and in consideration of FSD entering into this Subscription Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Investor hereby agrees that it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any assets held in the Trust Account, and shall not make any claim against the Trust Account, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to this Subscription Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Investor hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that it may have against the Trust Account now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any discussions, contracts or agreements with FSD and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to limit the Investor's right to distributions from the Trust Account in accordance with FSD's certificate of incorporation in respect of any redemptions by the Investor in respect of Shares acquired by any means other than pursuant to this Subscription Agreement. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to limit the Investor's right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of Shares currently outstanding on the date hereof, pursuant to a validly exercised redemption right with respect to any such Shares, except to the extent that the Investor has otherwise agreed with FSD to not exercise such redemption right.

  



  

10.   _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a)  Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that may accrue to

be transferred or assigned other than an assignment to any fund or account
managed by the same investment manager as the Investor or an affiliate
thereof.

  



  

(b)  FSD may request from the Investor such additional information as FSD may
deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of the Investor to acquire the

set forth herein are no longer accurate in any material respect (other than

(f)  This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or terminated
except by an instrument in writing, signed by each of the parties hereto. No
failure or delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.

  



  

(g) This Subscription Agreement (including the schedule hereto) constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This

Placement Agent shall be a third-party beneficiary to this Subscription
Agreement and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits hereunder and
may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.

  



  

(h) Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,
executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives, and permitted
assigns, and the agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and
acknowledgments contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be binding
upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns.

  



  

(i)  If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be adjudicated by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,

Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
and shall continue in full force and effect.

  



  

(j)  This Subscription Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by different
parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all parties
hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

  



  

(k) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement, without
posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

liability company (" _Sponsor_ "), and each of the stockholders of Parent
whose names appear on the signature pages of this Agreement (each, a "
_Founder_ " and, collectively, the " _Founders_ "). Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined will have the meaning given such terms in
the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), FS Development Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Sponsor_ "), Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as the Stockholders'
Representative, and the Company, are entering into that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time in accordance with its terms, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to
which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, with the Company as the surviving company in the merger and, after
giving effect to such merger, becoming a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent;

  



  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Founder owns of record the number of
Parent Class A Shares and Parent Class B Shares as set forth opposite such
Founder's name on _Exhibit A_ hereto (all such Parent Class A Shares and
Parent Class B Shares and the Parent Class A Shares and Parent Class B Shares
of which ownership of record or the power to vote is hereafter acquired by
the Founders prior to the termination of this Agreement being referred to
herein as the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and the Company to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Founders are executing and delivering this Agreement to Parent
and the Company.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
each of the Founders (severally and not jointly), the Company and Parent
hereby agrees as follows:

  



  

1.  _Agreement to Vote_. Each Founder, by this Agreement, with respect to its
Shares, hereby agrees to vote, at any meeting of the stockholders of Parent,
and in any action by written consent of the stockholders of Parent, all of
such Founder's Shares (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement, each of the Parent Proposals, the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and (b) in favor of any other matter
reasonably necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, the approval of the Parent Proposals and considered and
voted upon by the stockholders of Parent in connection therewith. Each
Founder acknowledges receipt and review of a copy of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2.  _Transfer of Shares_. Each of the Founders agrees that it shall not,
directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer (including by operation of
law), lien, pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any of the Shares or
otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing (unless the transferee agrees to
be bound by this Agreement), (b) deposit any Shares into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of
attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (c)
enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with
respect to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer
(including by operation of law) or other disposition of any Shares
(unless the transferee agrees to be bound by this Agreement) or (d) take any
action that would have the effect of preventing or disabling the Founder from
performing its obligations hereunder.

  



    

1

 



    



  

3.  _Waiver of Anti-Dilution Provision_. Each Founder hereby (but subject to
the consummation of the Merger) waives (for itself, for its successors, heirs
and assigns), to the fullest extent permitted by law and the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation of Parent (as may be amended from time
to time, the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), the provisions of
Section 4.3(b)(i) of the Certificate of Incorporation to have the Parent
Class B Shares convert to Parent Class A Shares at a ratio of greater than
one-for-one. The waiver specified in this _Section 3_ shall be applicable only
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement (and any shares of Class A Common Stock or equity-linked
securities issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement) and shall be void and of no force and
effect if the Merger Agreement shall be terminated for any reason.

  



  

4.  _Unpaid Parent Liabilities_. Sponsor agrees that in the event the Unpaid
Parent Liabilities as of immediately prior to the Closing are greater than
the $11,500,000 (the " _Maximum Liability Amount_ "), Sponsor will either (a)
forfeit for cancellation such number of whole Parent Class B Shares equal in
value to the excess of the Maximum Liability Amount divided by $10.00 or (b)
pay to Parent at the Closing an amount equal to the difference between the
Unpaid Parent Liabilities as of immediately prior to the Closing minus the
Maximum Liability Amount.

  



  

5.  _Representations and Warranties_. Each Founder, severally and not
jointly, represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

  



  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by such Founder of this Agreement
and the consummation by such Founder of the transactions contemplated hereby
do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable
to such Founder, (ii) require any consent, approval or authorization of,
declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, any person or entity,
(iii) result in the creation of any Lien on any Shares (other than pursuant
to this Agreement or transfer restrictions under applicable securities laws
or certificate of incorporation or operating agreement, if any (the "
_Organizational Documents_ ") of such Founder) or (iv) conflict with or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under any provision of such
Founder's Organizational Documents

  



  

(b) Such Founder owns of record and has good, valid and marketable title to
the Shares set forth opposite the Founder's name on _Exhibit A_ free and
clear of any Lien (other than pursuant to this Agreement or transfer
restrictions under applicable securities laws or the Organizational Documents
of such Founder) and has the sole power (as currently in effect) to vote and
full right, power and authority to sell, transfer and deliver such Shares,
and such Founder does not own, directly or indirectly, any other Shares.

  



  

(c) Such Founder has the power, authority and capacity to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and that this Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such Founder.

  



  

6.  _Termination_. This Agreement and the obligations of Sponsor and each of
the Founders under this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the
earliest of: (a) the Effective Time; (b) the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms; and (c) the mutual agreement of the
Company and Sponsor. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, no
party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement;
provided, however, such termination or expiration shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to its
termination.

  



  

7.  _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Paragraph (k).

Parties_ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of October [●], 2020 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among
Parent, FSG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), FS
Development Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as
the Stockholders' Representative, and Gemini Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, shall
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Merger Sub is being merged with and
into Gemini, with Gemini being the Surviving Corporation, as a result of which
Gemini will be the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to the
closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, FS Sponsor, the
Company and each Voting Party intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  



  

AGREEMENT

  



  

1. Agreement to Vote. During the Term (as defined below), each Voting Party
agrees to vote all voting securities of the Company that it owns from time to
time and may vote in the election of the Company's directors (collectively, "
_Voting Shares_ ") in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
whether at a regular or special meeting of stockholders or by written consent.

  



  

2. Board of Directors.

  



  

2.1 Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Company board of directors (the "Board") will be
comprised of seven (7) directors, which shall be divided into three (3)
classes, designated Class I, II and III, with Class I consisting of [●]
Directors, Class II consisting of [●] Directors and Class III consisting of
[●] Directors. [●], [●], [●] and [●] shall constitute the initial members of
Class I and shall be nominated in Class I, the members of which shall have an
initial term that expires at the annual meeting of stockholders of the
Company held in 2021; [●], [●] and [●] shall constitute the initial members of
Class II and shall be nominated in Class II, the members of which shall have
an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of stockholders of the
Company held in 2022; and [●], [●] and [●] shall constitute the initial
members of Class III and shall be nominated in Class III, the members of
which shall have an initial term that expires at the annual meeting of
stockholders held in 2023.

  



    

1

 



    



  

The full seven (7) member Board will be comprised of Jason Meyenberg, Jim
Tananbaum, Carl Gordon and four (4) other rmembers of the Gemini board of
directors.

  



  

2.2 Until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Term_ "), at each annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company,
FS Sponsor shall have the right to designate for election as a member of the
Board, and the Board (including any committee thereof) shall nominate (and
recommend for election and include such recommendation in a timely manner in
any proxy statement, consent solicitation or other applicable announcement to
the Company's stockholders), one (1) individual to serve as a Class III
Director; provided, however, if at any time during such five-year period the
FS Sponsor owns less than [●] shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company
(as adjusted for any share split, share dividend or other share
recapitalization, share exchange or other event), the rights of the FS Sponsor
and obligations of the Board under this Section 2.2 shall automatically
terminate.

  



  

2.3 Provisions relating to authority to appoint four (4) of the Gemini
directors set forth in _Section 2.1_ to be determined by Gemini's current
board of directors at its sole discretion.

  



  

2.4 If FS Sponsor or [●] cease to be entitled to nominate any Directors in
accordance with Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, then such Directors shall be
nominated by the Board and approved by the holders of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock. All Directors shall hold office, subject to their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with this Agreement and applicable
law, until their respective successors shall have been elected and qualified.

  



  

2.5 All Directors elected in accordance with Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as
applicable, shall be removed from the Board only upon the vote or written
consent of the Voting Party that is entitled to nominate, appoint or elect
such Director under Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable. Upon any
decrease in the rights of any such Voting Party to nominate, appoint or elect
any Director pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable, the
applicable Voting Party shall promptly cause the removal or resignation of an
applicable number of Directors if requested by the Board. Upon any individual
elected as provided in Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable, ceasing to
be a member of the Board, whether by death, resignation or removal or
otherwise, only the Voting Party that was entitled to nominate, appoint or
elect such individual under Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable, shall
have the right to fill any resulting vacancy in the Board; provided that such
Voting Party still has the right to nominate, appoint or elect the applicable
Director pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable. If the Company
has reduced the size of the Board following such death, resignation or
removal or other departure of such individual from the Board, then if
requested by any Voting Party entitled to designate a Director pursuant to
Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable, who is not currently serving on
the Board, the Company and the Voting Party shall take all actions necessary
to increase the size of the Board and nominate, appoint or elect to the
resulting vacancy the applicable Director entitled to be designated by such
Voting Party pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable.

  



  

3. Successors in Interest of the Voting Parties and the Company. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon the successors in interest
of any Voting Party with respect to any of such Voting Party's Voting Shares
or any voting rights therein, unless the Voting Shares are sold on a national
securities exchange on which the Company common stock is listed for
trading on the date in question (the " _Trading Market_ ").

  



  

4. Grant of Proxy. The parties agree that this Agreement does not constitute
the granting of a proxy to any party or any other person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, should the provisions of this Agreement be construed to
constitute the granting of proxies, such proxies shall be deemed coupled with
an interest and are irrevocable for the term of this Agreement.

  



    

2

 



    



  

5.  Specific Enforcement. It is agreed and understood that (a) monetary
damages would not adequately compensate an injured party for the breach of
this Agreement by any party hereto, (b) this Agreement shall be specifically
enforceable and (c) any breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject
of a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining order. Further, each
party hereto waives any claim or defence that there is an adequate remedy at
law for such breach or threatened breach and agrees that a party's rights
would be materially and adversely affected if the obligations of the other
parties under this Agreement were not carried out in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereof.

  



  

6. Manner of Voting. The voting of the Voting Shares pursuant to this
Agreement may be effected in person, by proxy, by written consent or in any
other manner permitted by applicable law.

  



  

7. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the last day of the Term.

  



  

8. Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, any provision
of this Agreement may be amended, or the observance thereof may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) only with the written consent of the Company, FS Sponsor and
[●].

  



  

9. Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, etc. In the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or the like, any securities issued
with respect to Voting Shares held by the Voting Parties shall become Voting
Shares for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

10. Severability. In the event that any provision of the Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

  



  

11. Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties
arising hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its conflicts of law
provisions.

  



  

12. Counterparts; Electronic Execution or Delivery. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. This
Agreement may be executed electronically; any executed counterpart of this
Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or electronic mail; and any such
electronically executed or delivered copy of a counterpart signature page
shall have the same force and effect as an originally executed copy hereof.

  



  

13. Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be
binding upon, the successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

  



  

14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties, and supersedes any prior
agreement or understanding among the parties, with regard to the subject
hereof, and no party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any
manner by any warranties, representations or covenants except as specifically
set forth herein or therein.

Exhibit E

  

  



  

FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of [●], 2020,
by and between: FS Development Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Sponsor"), FS Development Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company
solely in its capacity as the representative of the Company Securityholders
(the "Stockholder Representative"), solely in its capacity as the
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the stockholders of the Company,
and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation (the
"Escrow Agent").

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, FSG Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Gemini Therapeutics, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Stockholder Representative
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October [●], 2020 (the
"Merger Agreement"), providing for, among other things, the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company and the conversion of shares of Company Capital
Stock (other than the Dissenting Shares) into the right to receive a number
of Parent Class A Shares equal to the Closing Consideration Conversion Ratio
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 4.1(i) of the Merger Agreement, Parent is
required to deposit 2,150,000 Parent Class A Shares, par value $0.0001 per
share (the "Escrow Shares"), which Escrow Shares would otherwise be issuable
to the Escrow Participants (as defined in the Merger Agreement), with the
Escrow Agent on the date hereof in connection with the indemnification
obligations of the Escrow Participants as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; and

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. Appointment; Defined Terms.

  



  

(a) Sponsor and the Stockholder Representative hereby appoint the Escrow
Agent as its escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow
Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

  



  

(b) All capitalized terms with respect to the Escrow Agent shall be defined
herein. The Escrow Agent shall act only in accordance with the terms and
conditions contained in this Agreement and shall have no duties or obligations
with respect to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2. Escrow Shares.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees to deposit the Escrow Shares with the Escrow Agent on the
date hereof. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Shares as a book-entry
position registered on a pro rata basis in the proportion set forth next to
the name of each stockholder of the Company as indicated on _Exhibit A_.

  



  

(b) Escrow Shares.

  



  

(i)  For so long as the Escrow Shares are held by the Escrow Agent, with
respect to any matter for which the Escrow Shares are permitted to vote, the
Escrow Agent shall vote, or cause to be voted, the Escrow Shares in the manner
directed by the Stockholder Representative. In the absence of an instruction
from the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent shall not vote any of
the shares comprising the Escrow Shares.

  



  

   

1

 



    

  



  

(ii) Any dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the Escrow
Shares (collectively, the " _Escrowed Dividends_ ") shall be delivered to the
Escrow Agent and shall immediately be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the
same person or entity to whom such Escrow Shares are to be released in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
release or distribution of Escrow Dividends is intended to comply with, and
shall be effected in accordance with, Rev. Proc. 84-42, 1984-1 C.B. 521.

  



  

(iii) In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination,
exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off or other similar change in
capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of the common stock
of Parent other than a regular cash dividend, the Escrow Shares under _Section
2(a)_ above shall be appropriately adjusted on a pro rata basis.

  



  

3. Disposition and Termination.

  



  

(a) In the event that the Escrow Agent receives an instruction letter signed
by each of Sponsor and the Stockholder Representative, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly distribute all or any portion of the Escrow Shares as directed by
such instruction letter.

  



  

4. Escrow Agent.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither
be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any
requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
instrument or document between Parent or Sponsor and any other person or
entity, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the
Merger Agreement or nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if
any person or entity has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such
agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
those of the Merger Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to this
Agreement, or any other agreement between Parent or Sponsor and any other
person or entity, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or
refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the applicable person without inquiry and
without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable to any beneficiary or other person for refraining from acting
upon any instruction setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or
related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Shares, or any portion
thereof, unless such instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
in accordance with  _Section 10_ below and the Escrow Agent has been able to
satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder and
as set forth in _Section 10_. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to
inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such
document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty
to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Shares nor shall
the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy
or correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder.

  



  

   

2

 



    

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow
Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause
of any loss. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of
its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. The Escrow
Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be
selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in
accordance with, or in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons except to the extent that a
final adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct was the
primary cause of any loss. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be
uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be
to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a
direction in writing which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Agent or by a final and non-appealable order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

5. Succession.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days' advance notice in writing
of such resignation to the other parties hereto specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect, _provided that_ such resignation shall not
take effect until a successor escrow agent has been appointed in accordance
with this _Section 5_. If the parties hereto have jointly failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or
for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be
binding upon all of the parties hereto. The Escrow Agent's sole
responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to
hold the Escrow Shares and to deliver the same to a designated substitute
escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order
or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of delivery
the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject
to the provisions of _Section 7_ below. In accordance with _Section 7_
 below, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to withhold, as security, an
amount of shares equal to any dollar amount due and owing to the Escrow
Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe
may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all
the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Agreement without further act.

  



  

6. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services under this Agreement as Escrow Agent and for
reimbursement for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, in the amounts and payable as set forth on _Schedule 2_. All
amounts owing under the foregoing sentence shall be paid by Parent. The Escrow
Agent shall also be entitled to payment of any amounts to which the Escrow
Agent is entitled under the indemnification provisions contained herein as
set forth in _Section_ 7; _provided, however, that_ such compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances shall not be paid from the Escrow

(a) The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from
and against any expenses, including counsel fees and disbursements, or loss
suffered by the Escrow Agent in connection with any action, suit or other
proceeding involving any claim which in any way, directly or indirectly,
arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the services of the Escrow Agent
hereunder, other than expenses or losses arising from the fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. Promptly after the
receipt by the Escrow Agent of notice of any demand or claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Escrow Agent shall notify
the other parties hereto in writing and keep the parties advised with respect
to all developments concerning such claim. In the event of the receipt of

in the nature of interpleader in the any state or federal court located in
New York County, State of New York.

protected in acting upon any order, notice, demand, certificate, opinion or
advice of counsel (including counsel chosen by the Escrow Agent), statement,
instrument, report or other paper or document (not only as to its due

suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of

implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, parties hereto acknowledge
that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agent's identity
verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which
may be used to confirm identity, including without limitation name, address
and organizational documents ("identifying information"). The parties hereto
agree to provide the Escrow Agent with information and consent to the Escrow
Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying information required
as a condition of opening an account with or using any service provided by
the Escrow Agent.

  



  

(b) The underlying transaction does not constitute an installment sale
requiring any tax reporting or withholding of imputed interest or original
issue discount to the IRS or other taxing authority.

judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the
property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by opinion
of legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or
without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent reasonably obeys
or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any
of the parties hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by
reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

12. Miscellaneous. Except for changes to transfer instructions as provided in
_Section 10_ , the provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered,
amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by the
Escrow Agent and the other parties hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any
right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the Escrow
Agent or any other party hereto without the prior consent of all the other
parties hereto. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the
laws of the State of New York. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives
any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar
grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other
manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of any
court of the State of New York or United States federal court, in each case,
sitting in New York County, New York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction
any party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets,

electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other
causes reasonably beyond its control. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of
the parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or other
electronic transmission (including e-mail), and such facsimile or other
electronic transmission (including e-mail) will, for all purposes, be deemed
to be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and
will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law
of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. A person who is
not a party to this Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this
Agreement. The parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such party to the other party shall
comply with applicable laws and regulations. Where, however, the conflicting
provisions of any such applicable law may be waived, they are hereby
irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to the end that this Agreement shall be enforced as written. Except as
expressly provided in _Section 7_ above, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other
than the Escrow Agent and the other parties hereto any legal or equitable
right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or the
Escrow Shares escrowed hereunder.

2.  REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

  



  

2.1  _Resale Shelf Registration Rights_.

  



  

2.1.1  _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable Securities_.
The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the
Commission as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement), but in any event no later than [●]1 days
after the Closing Date (the " _Filing Date_ "), a Registration Statement for
an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act registering the resale from time to time by Investors of all
of the Registrable Securities then held by such Investors that are not
covered by an effective registration statement on the Filing Date (the "
_Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf Registration
Statement shall be on Form S-3 or another appropriate form permitting
Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by such Investors. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible after
filing, and once effective, to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act at all times until the
expiration of the Effectiveness Period.

  



  

2.1.2  _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company shall notify
the Investors in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number
of copies of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any
amendments, supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein
(including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and
supplements) and any documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or such other documents as the Investors may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable
Securities in the manner described in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement.

  



  

2.1.3  _Amendments and Supplements; Subsequent Shelf Registration_. Subject
to the provisions of _Section 2.1.1_ above, the Company shall promptly
prepare and file with the Commission from time to time such amendments and
supplements to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the
Effectiveness Period, or to file an additional Registration Statement as a
shelf registration (a " _Subsequent Shelf Registration_ ") registering the
resale of all outstanding Registrable Securities from time to time, and
pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and
requested by, any holder. If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent
Shelf Registration to become effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as is reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and (ii) keep such
Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective and to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all the
Registrable Securities at all times during the Effectiveness Period.

2.1.4  Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this
_Section 2.1_ , in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of
the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415,
be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the holders
thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), in either case covering the
maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the
Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available to register for resale
the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; provided, however, that
prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, the Company
shall be obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts to advocate
with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities
in accordance with any publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments,
requirements or requests of the Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "),
including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number of Registrable
Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement
as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company used
commercially reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless
otherwise directed in writing by a holder as to its Registrable Securities,
the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration
Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the total number of
Registrable Securities held by the Investors, subject to a determination by
the Commission that certain Investors must be reduced first based on
the number of Registrable Securities held by such Investors. In the event the
Company amends the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a New
Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above,
the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the
Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to
the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to
register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for
resale on the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New
Registration Statement.

  



  

2.1.5  _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify the
Investors in writing of any request by the Commission for any amendment or
supplement to, or additional information in connection with, the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement required to be prepared and filed hereunder (or
Prospectus relating thereto). The Company shall promptly notify each Investor
in writing of the filing of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or any
Prospectus, amendment or supplement related thereto or any post-
effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the
effectiveness of any post-effective amendment.

  



  

(a) If the Company shall receive a request from the holders of Registrable
Securities with an estimated market value of at least $[●]2 (the requesting
holder(s) shall be referred to herein as the " _Requesting Holder(s)_ ") that
the Company effect the Underwritten Takedown of all or any portion of the
Requesting Holder's Registrable Securities, and specifying the intended
method of disposition thereof, then the Company shall promptly give notice of
such requested Underwritten Takedown at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the anticipated filing date of the prospectus or supplement relating to such
Underwritten Takedown to the other Investors and thereupon shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as possible, the offering
in such Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i)  subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested such
offering under _Section 2.1.5(a)_ , and

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all other
Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities (all such
holders, together with the Requesting Holder, the " _Selling Holders_ ") have
requested the Company to offer by request received by the Company within
seven Business Days after such holders receive the Company's notice of the
Underwritten Takedown, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition
(in accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the
Registrable Securities so to be offered.

(b)  Promptly after the expiration of the seven-Business Day-period referred
to in _Section 2.1.5(a)(ii)_ , the Company will notify all Selling Holders
of the identities of the other Selling Holders and the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



  

(c) the Company shall only be required to effectuate: (i) one Underwritten
Takedown within any six-month period; (ii) no more than [●]3 Underwritten
Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the Company
Investors after giving effect to _Section 2.2.1(c)_ ; and (iii) no more than
[●]4 Underwritten Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities held by
Gemini Investors after giving effect to _Section 2.2.1(d)_.

  



  

(d) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises the
Company and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering
exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having an
adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares can
be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be reduced by
the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on a pro rata
basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by such
Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Investors must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Investors).

  



  

2.1.6  _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling Holders holding a majority in
interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which Underwriter
or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In connection
with an Underwritten Takedown, the Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take
such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Takedown, including, if necessary, the engagement of a "qualified independent
underwriter" in connection with the qualification of the underwriting
arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

  



  

2.1.7 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

  



  

2.2  _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1  _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time after
the expiration of a lock-up to which such shares are subject, if any, (i)
Company Investors who hold a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities held by all Company Investors or (ii) Company Investors who hold
[●]5 of the Registrable Securities held by all Company Investors, as the case
may be, may make a written demand for Registration under the Securities Act of
all or any portion of their Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or any similar
long-form Registration or, if then available, on Form S-3. Each registration
requested pursuant to this _Section 2.2.1_ is referred to herein as a "
_Demand Registration_ ". Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify
the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will notify all
Investors that are holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and each
such holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a portion
of such holder's Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such
holder including shares of Registrable Securities in such registration, a "
_Demanding Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company within fifteen (15) days
after the receipt by the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any such
request, the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to have their Registrable
Securities included in the Demand Registration, subject to _Section 2.2.4_
and the provisos set forth in _Section 3.1.1_. The Company shall not be
obligated to effect: (a) more than one (1) Demand Registration during any
six-month period; (b) any Demand Registration at any time there is an
effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement on file with the Commission
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ; (c) more than [●]6 Underwritten Demand
Registrations in respect of all Registrable Securities held by the Company
Investors, each of which will also count as an Underwritten Takedown of the
Company Investors under _Section 2.1.5(c)(ii)_ ; or (d) more than [●]7
Underwritten Demand Registrations in respect of all Registrable Securities
held by Gemini Investors, each of which will also count as an Underwritten
Takedown of Gemini Investors under _Section 2.1.5(c)(iii)_.

2.2.2  _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration Statement
has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant
to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction
of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the
offering; provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to file
a second Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been
filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.2.3  _Underwritten Offering_. If the Demanding Holders so elect and such
holders so advise the Company as part of their written demand for a Demand
Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering with an
estimated market value of at least $[●]8. In such event, the right of any
holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be
conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the
inclusion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the
extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the holders initiating the Demand
Registration, and subject to the approval of the Company.

  



  

2.2.4  _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the
Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number
of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders desire to
sell, taken together with all other Common Stock or other securities which
the Company desires to sell and the Common Stock, if any, as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back
registration rights held by other shareholders of the Company who desire to
sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that can
be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering
price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of
such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "), then the Company shall
include in such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities as to
which Demand Registration has been requested by the Demanding Holders (pro
rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has
requested be included in such registration, regardless of the number of
shares held by each such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as "
_Pro Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Common Stock or other
securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (iii) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), the Common Stock or other securities for the account of other
persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written
contractual arrangements with such persons, as to which "piggy-
back" registration has been requested by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

2.2.5  _Withdrawal_. A Demanding Holder shall have the right to withdraw all
or any portion of its Registrable Securities included in an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ for any reason or no reason whatsoever
upon written notice to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of its
intention to withdraw from such Underwritten Offering prior to the pricing of
such Underwritten Offering and such withdrawn amount shall no longer be
considered an Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the registration
expenses incurred in connection with an Underwritten Offering prior to its
withdrawal under this _Section 2.2.5_.

  



  

2.3  _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1  _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time after the first anniversary of the
date of this Agreement, the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, equity securities, by the Company for its own account or for
shareholders of the Company for their account (or by the Company and by
shareholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ ), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection
with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange
offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing shareholders,
(iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of
the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company
shall (x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of
Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than ten
(10) days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a " _Piggy-
Back Registration_ "). The rights provided under this _Section 2.3.1 _ shall
not be available to any Investor at such time as (i) there is an effective
Resale Shelf Registration Statement available for the resale of the
Registerable Securities pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , (ii) such Registration is
solely to be used for the offering of securities by the Company for its own
account and (iii) no other shareholder of the Company is entitled to
participate in such Registration. The Company shall cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts
to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten
offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a
Piggy-Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of the Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to
distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves
an Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-
Back Registration.

2.3.2  _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the
dollar amount or number of Common Stock which the Company desires to sell,
taken together with Common Stock, if any, as to which registration has been
demanded pursuant to written contractual arrangements with persons other than
the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder and the
Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested under this
_Section 2.3_ , exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then the Company shall
include in any such registration:

  



  

(a) If the registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A) first,
the Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires to sell that
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (B) second, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Common Stock or other securities, if any,
comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares, Pro Rata; and (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B), the Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and

  



  

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand
of persons other than either the holders of Registrable Securities, (A)
first, the Common Stock or other securities for the account of the demanding
persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Common Stock or other securities
that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Common Stock or other securities, if any, comprised of Registrable Securities,
Pro Rata, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the terms
hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and
(D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the Common Stock or
other securities for the account of other persons that the Company is
obligated to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements with such
persons, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.3.3  _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal
by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company
shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in _Section 3.3_.

  



  

3. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

  



  

3.1  _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 2_ , the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to effect the

intended method(s) of distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable,
and in connection with any such request:

  



  

3.1.1  _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request for
a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , prepare and file with the

qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which
form shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities to be
registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective and use its reasonable best
efforts to keep it effective for the Effectiveness Period; provided, however,
that the Company shall have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up
to sixty (60) days, and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may
be applicable to deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-
Back Registration relates, in each case if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), it would be
materially detrimental to the Company and its shareholders for such
Registration Statement to be effected at such time; provided,
further, however, that the Company shall not have the right to exercise the
right set forth in the immediately preceding proviso for more than a total of
ninety (90) consecutive calendar days, or more than one hundred twenty (120)
total calendar days in any 365-day period.

Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such

3.1.3  _Amendments and Supplements_. Until the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which (A)
all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration

Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder (or any
successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission)) or (B) the Holders
of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the Registrable
Securities under Rule 144 (or any similar provision) under the Securities Act
without limitation on the amount of securities sold or the manner of sale,
the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, and supplements to such Registration
Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary
to keep such Registration Statement effective and in compliance with the
provisions of the Securities Act (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  



  

3.1.4  _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement, the
Company shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) Business Days after
such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such holders
promptly and confirm such advice in writing in all events within two
(2) Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) when such
Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when any post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the issuance
or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the Company

remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any
prospectus relating thereto or for additional information or of the
occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or
amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of the securities covered by such Registration Statement, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any
such supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
including documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such
holders and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such
documents and comment thereon.

3.1.5  _Securities Laws Compliance_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by
the Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities

cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any
and all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not

majority-in-interest of the participating holders.

  



  

3.1.8  _Opinions_. On the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for
sale pursuant to any Registration, the Company shall obtain an opinion, dated
such date, of one (1) counsel representing the Company for the purposes of

Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable

3.4  _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall promptly
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by the Company, or
the managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any
Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in
order to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act and in connection with the Company's obligation to comply with
Federal and applicable state securities laws.

  



  

4. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

  



  

4.1  _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities,
and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors,
partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who
controls an Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) (each, an " _Investor Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any
expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or
several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or allegedly
untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or
supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon
any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending
any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company, in writing, by such selling holder expressly for use therein.
The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and
each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing sentence with
respect to the indemnification of the holders.

  



  

4.2  _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers, and each other
selling holder and each other person, if any, who controls another selling
holder within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims,
judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such
losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or allegedly
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon
any omission or the alleged omission to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, but
only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to
the Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein, and shall
reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and each other selling
holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling holder's
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and
shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by such
selling holder. The selling holders shall indemnify the Underwriters, their
officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the
foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Company.

  



  

   

13

 



    

  



  

4.3  _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ ,
such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder,
notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however,
that the failure by the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the
Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and
solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such
failure. If the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to
any claim or action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action,
and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other
Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume control
of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that in any
action in which both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are
named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel, which
counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) to represent the
Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability
arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses
of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the
written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment
or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

  



  

4.4  _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ and _4.3_ is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and the
Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified
Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



    

14

 



    



  

4.4.2  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.4.2_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
_Section 4.4.1_.

  



  

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 4.4_ , no holder of
Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any
underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such
holder from the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such
contribution obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

5. UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION.

  



  

5.1  _Rule 144_. As long as any holder shall own Registrable Securities, the
Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company under the
Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish such holders with true and
complete copies of all such filings. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any such holder may reasonably request, all
to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell shares
of Common Stock held by such holder without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any
holder, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written certification of a
duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

  



  

6. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS

  



  

6.1  _Investor Lock-Up_. Each Investor agrees that such Investor shall not
Transfer any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for Common Stock (whether
such shares of Common Stock or any such securities are held by such Investor
as of the date of this Agreement or are thereafter acquired) for one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date (as such term is defined
in the Merger Agreement). The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to
preclude each Investor during the Lock-up Period from engaging in any hedging
or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be
expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of such Investor's
shares of Common Stock even if such shares of Common Stock would be disposed
of by someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other
transactions during the Lock-up Period would include without limitation any
short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without
limitation, any put or call option) with respect to any of the Investor's
shares of Common Stock or with respect to any security that includes, relates
to, or derives any significant part of its value from such shares of Common
Stock. The foregoing notwithstanding, each executive officer and director of
the Company shall be permitted to establish a plan to acquire and sell shares
of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, no sale of shares under any such plan shall be made prior to the
expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) lock-up period referred to in the
first sentence of this _Section 6.1_.

  



    

15

 



    



  

7.  MISCELLANEOUS.

  



  

7.1  _Other Registration Rights and Arrangements_. The Company represents and
warrants that no person, other than a holder of the Registrable Securities
has any right to require the Company to register any of the Company's share
capital for sale or to include the Company's share capital in any
registration filed by the Company for the sale of shares for its own
account or for the account of any other person. Company and the Company
Investors hereby terminate the Prior Agreement, which shall be of no further
force and effect and is hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by this
Agreement. The Company shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with
respect to its securities which is inconsistent with or violates the rights
granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement and in the
event of any conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

7.2  _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned
or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable
Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any permitted transfer of
Registrable Securities by any such holder. This Agreement and the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and the holders of
Registrable Securities and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any
persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in 
_Section 4_ and this _Section 7.2_. The rights of a holder of Registrable
Securities under this Agreement may be transferred by such a holder to a
transferee who acquires or holds Registrable Securities; provided, however,
that such transferee has executed and delivered to the Company a properly
completed agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement substantially
in form attached hereto as Exhibit A (an " _Addendum Agreement_ "), and the
transferor shall have delivered to the Company no later than thirty (30) days
following the date of the transfer, written notification of such transfer
setting forth the name of the transferor, the name and address of the
transferee, and the number of Registrable Securities so transferred. The
execution of an Addendum Agreement shall constitute a permitted amendment of
this Agreement.

  



  

7.3  _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the Company
and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions,
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of
such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver
hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its capacity
as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a manner that is
materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall require
the consent of the Holder so affected. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, clause "(ii) of the definition of "Registrable Securities, Section
2.1.5(c)(ii), Section 2.2.1(i), Section 2.2.1(c), Section 6.1 and Section 7.4
shall only be waived, amended and modified by the Company Investors who hold a
majority in interest of the Registrable Securities held by all Company
Investors at the time in question. No course of dealing between any Holder
or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on the part
of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or remedies under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any Holder or
the Company. No single or partial exercise of any rights or remedies under
this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or preclude the
exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder by such
party.

  



  

   

16

 



    

  



  

7.4  _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which (A)
all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in
Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder (or any
successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission)) or (B) the Holders
of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the
Registrable Securities under Rule 144 (or any similar provision) under the
Securities Act without limitation on the amount of securities sold or the
manner of sale; provided further that with respect to any Investor, such
Investor will have no rights under this Agreement and all obligations of the
Company to such Investor under this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier
of (x) the date such Investor ceases to hold at least [●] Registrable
Securities or (y) if such Investor is an individual and such Investor is a
director or an executive officer of Gemini as of immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger, the date such Investor is no longer an affiliate
of the Company; provided, however, that the provisions of _Section 4_ ,
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 6.1_ shall survive such termination.

  



  

7.5  _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other
communications (collectively, " _Notices_ ") required or permitted to be
given hereunder or which are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be personally served, delivered by reputable air courier
service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by facsimile or email,

have specified most recently by written notice. Notice shall be deemed given

action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of

stockholders in lieu thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, and the

of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, shall be required to amend

meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
affirmative vote of not less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares
of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, and the affirmative vote of not
less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to

shall, subject to _Article VI_ , _Section 3_ hereof, determine the class or
classes to which the increased or decreased number of Directors shall be
apportioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that no decrease in the number of
Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. In the event of a

Section 1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders (any such
meeting being referred to in these By-laws as an " _Annual Meeting_ ") shall
be held at the hour, date and place within or without the United States which
is fixed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of
Directors_ "), which time, date and place may subsequently be changed at any
time by vote of the Board of Directors. If no Annual Meeting has been held
for a period of thirteen (13) months after the Corporation's last Annual
Meeting, a special meeting in lieu thereof may be held, and such special
meeting shall have, for the purposes of these By-laws or otherwise, all the
force and effect of an Annual Meeting. Any and all references hereafter in
these By-laws to an Annual Meeting or Annual Meetings also shall be deemed to
refer to any special meeting(s) in lieu thereof.

  



  

Section 2. _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_.

  



  

(a)  _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the
proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be
brought before an Annual Meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder
of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these By-laws, who
is entitled to vote at the meeting, who is present (in person or by proxy) at
the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in these
By-laws as to such nomination or business. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing clause (ii) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring
nominations or business properly before an Annual Meeting (other than matters
properly brought under Rule 14a-8 (or any successor rule) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")), and
such stockholder must comply with the notice and other procedures set forth in
_Article I_ , _Section 2(a)(2)_ and  _(3)_ of these By-laws to bring such
nominations or business properly before an Annual Meeting. In addition to the
other requirements set forth in these By-laws, for any proposal of business
to be considered at an Annual Meeting, it must be a proper subject for action
by stockholders of the Corporation under Delaware law.

of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the one-year

(30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, or
if no Annual Meeting were held in the preceding year, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation
not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day

Shareholder Rights Agreement or the Voting Agreement, the presiding officer of
the Annual Meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether the
stockholder proposal or nomination was made in accordance with the provisions
of these By-laws, the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement or the

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Article I_ , _Section
2_ , if the nominating or proposing stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the Annual Meeting to
present a nomination or any business, such nomination or business shall be
disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this _Article I_ , _Section
2_ , to be considered a qualified representative of the proposing
stockholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by
such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder
to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such
person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a
reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic
transmission, to the presiding officer at the meeting of stockholders.

under the Exchange Act and, to the extent required by such rule, have such
proposals considered and voted on at an Annual Meeting or (ii) the holders of
any series of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified

not less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock
entitled to vote thereon, and the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds
(2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a

,  _Section 2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board of Directors
recommends that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at such meeting
of stockholders, such amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such
amendment or repeal, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by statute and
subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Undesignated
Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may
be called only by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution

less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital
stock entitled to vote thereon, and the affirmative vote of not less than two
thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon
as a class, shall be required to amend or repeal any provision of this
_Article I_ , _Section 3_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Board of
Directors recommends that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at
such meeting of stockholders, such amendment or repeal shall only require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on
such amendment or repeal, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings; Adjournments_.

  



  

(a) A notice of each Annual Meeting stating the hour, date and place, if any,
of such Annual Meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by
which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such meeting, shall be given not less than ten (10) days nor more
than sixty (60) days before the Annual Meeting, to each stockholder entitled
to vote thereat by delivering such notice to such stockholder or by mailing
it, postage prepaid, addressed to such stockholder at the address of such
stockholder as it appears on the Corporation's stock transfer books. Without
limiting the manner by which notice may otherwise be given to stockholders,
any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the
manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
_DGCL_ ").

  



  

(b) Unless otherwise required by the DGCL, notice of all special meetings of
stockholders shall be given in the same manner as provided for Annual
Meetings, except that the notice of all special meetings shall state the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called.

  



  

(c) Notice of an Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders need not
be given to a stockholder if a waiver of notice is executed, or waiver of
notice by electronic transmission is provided, before or after such meeting by
such stockholder or if such stockholder attends such meeting, unless such
attendance is for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not
lawfully called or convened.

  



  

(d) The Board of Directors may postpone and reschedule any previously
scheduled Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders and any record
date with respect thereto, regardless of whether any notice or public
disclosure with respect to any such meeting has been sent or made pursuant to
_Section 2_ of this _Article I_ of these By-laws or otherwise. In no event
shall the public announcement of an adjournment, postponement or rescheduling
of any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders commence a new time
period for the giving of a stockholder's notice under this _Article I_ of
these By-laws.

  



  

(e) When any meeting is convened, the presiding officer may adjourn the
meeting if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of business, (ii) the
Board of Directors determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate to
enable the stockholders to consider fully information which the Board of
Directors determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to
stockholders, or (iii) the Board of Directors determines that adjournment is
otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation. When any Annual Meeting
or special meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another hour, date or
place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting other than an
announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the hour,
date and place, if any, to which the meeting is adjourned and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from
the meeting date, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may
be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat and each
stockholder who, by law or under the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation (as the same may hereafter be amended and/or restated, the "
_Certificate_ ") or these By-laws, is entitled to such notice.

Section 5. _Quorum_. A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of stockholders. If less than a quorum is present at a meeting, the
holders of voting stock representing a majority of the voting power present
at the meeting or the presiding officer may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice, except
as provided in _Section 4_ of this _Article I_. At such adjourned meeting at
which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly
constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum.

  



  

Section 6. _Voting and Proxies_. Stockholders shall have one vote for each
share of stock entitled to vote owned by them of record according to the
stock ledger of the Corporation as of the record date, unless otherwise
provided by law or by the Certificate. Stockholders may vote either (i) in
person, (ii) by written proxy or (iii) by a transmission permitted by Section
212(c) of the DGCL. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission permitted by Section 212(c) of
the DGCL may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission. Proxies shall be filed in
accordance with the procedures established for the meeting of stockholders.
Except as otherwise limited therein or as otherwise provided by law,
proxies authorizing a person to vote at a specific meeting shall entitle the
persons authorized thereby to vote at any adjournment of such meeting, but
they shall not be valid after final adjournment of such meeting. A proxy with
respect to stock held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if
executed by or on behalf of any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise
of the proxy the Corporation receives a specific written notice to the
contrary from any one of them.

  



  

Section 7. _Action at Meeting_. When a quorum is present at any meeting of
stockholders, any matter before any such meeting (other than an election of a
director or directors) shall be decided by a majority of the votes properly
cast for and against such matter, except where a larger vote is required by
law, by the Certificate or by these By-laws. Any election of directors by
stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes properly cast on
the election of directors.

  



  

Section 8. _Stockholder Lists_. The Secretary or an Assistant Secretary (or
the Corporation's transfer agent or other person authorized by these By-laws
or by law) shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every Annual
Meeting or special meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting as provided in the manner, and subject to the terms, set forth
in Section 219 of the DGCL (or any successor provision). The list shall also
be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting as provided by law.

Section 9. _Presiding Officer_. The Board of Directors shall designate a
representative to preside over all Annual Meetings or special meetings
of stockholders, provided that if the Board of Directors does not so
designate such a presiding officer, then the Chairman of the Board, if one is
elected, shall preside over such meetings. If the Board of Directors does not
so designate such a presiding officer and there is no Chairman of the Board
or the Chairman of the Board is unable to so preside or is absent, then the
Chief Executive Officer, if one is elected, shall preside over such meetings,
provided further that if there is no Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Executive Officer is unable to so preside or is absent, then the President
shall preside over such meetings. The presiding officer at any Annual Meeting
or special meeting of stockholders shall have the power, among other things,
to adjourn such meeting at any time and from time to time, subject to
_Sections 4_ and _5_ of this _Article I_. The order of business and all
other matters of procedure at any meeting of the stockholders shall be
determined by the presiding officer.

  



  

Section 10. _Inspectors of Elections_. The Corporation shall, in advance of
any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate
one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who
fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the presiding officer shall appoint one or more inspectors to
act at the meeting. Any inspector may, but need not, be an officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall perform such duties as are
required by the DGCL, including the counting of all votes and ballots. The
inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors. The presiding
officer may review all determinations made by the inspectors, and in so doing
the presiding officer shall be entitled to exercise his or her sole judgment
and discretion and he or she shall not be bound by any determinations made by
the inspectors. All determinations by the inspectors and, if applicable, the
presiding officer, shall be subject to further review by any court of
competent jurisdiction.

waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the

present shall constitute action by the Board of Directors, unless otherwise
required by law, by the Certificate or by these By-laws.

  



  

Section 12. _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a
meeting if all members of the Board of Directors consent thereto in writing
or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the records of the meetings of
the Board of Directors. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form. Such consent shall be treated as a resolution
of the Board of Directors for all purposes.

committees, including, without limitation, a Compensation Committee, a
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and an Audit Committee, and may
delegate thereto some or all of its powers except those which by law, by the
Certificate or by these By-laws may not be delegated. Except as the Board of
Directors may otherwise determine, any such committee may make rules for the
conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by the Board of
Directors or in such rules, its business shall be conducted so far as possible
in the same manner as is provided by these By-laws for the Board of
Directors. All members of such committees shall hold such offices at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may abolish any
such committee at any time. Any committee to which the Board of Directors

time to time be prescribed by the Board of Directors. Such certificate shall
be signed by any two authorized officers of the Corporation. The Corporation
seal and the signatures by the Corporation's officers, the transfer agent or

registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on such
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar
at the time of its issue. Every certificate for shares of stock which are
subject to any restriction on transfer and every certificate issued when the
Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock
shall contain such legend with respect thereto as is required by law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in these By-laws, the Board
of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any
or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares
(except that the foregoing shall not apply to shares represented by a
certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation), and by
the approval and adoption of these By-laws the Board of Directors has
determined that all classes or series of the Corporation's stock may be
uncertificated, whether upon original issuance, re-issuance, or subsequent
transfer.

  



  

Section 2. _Transfers_. Subject to any restrictions on transfer and unless
otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shares of stock that are
represented by a certificate may be transferred on the books of the
Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the
certificate theretofore properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
assignment or power of attorney properly executed, with transfer stamps (if
necessary) affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as
the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. Shares of stock
that are not represented by a certificate may be transferred on the books of
the Corporation by submitting to the Corporation or its transfer agent such
evidence of transfer and following such other procedures as the Corporation
or its transfer agent may require.

  



  

Section 3. _Record Holders_. Except as may otherwise be required by law, by
the Certificate or by these By-laws, the Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the owner of such
stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and the right to
vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other

rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record
date: (a) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more
than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such
meeting and (b) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty
(60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 5. _Replacement of Certificates_. In case of the alleged loss,
destruction or mutilation of a certificate of stock of the Corporation, a
duplicate certificate may be issued in place thereof, upon such terms as the

matter therein (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation),

unless such Proceeding was brought to enforce such Officer's or Director's
rights to indemnification or, in the case of Directors, advancement of
Expenses under these By-laws in accordance with the provisions set forth
herein.

  



  

Section 3. _Indemnification of Non-Officer Employees_. Subject to the
operation of _Section 4_ of this _Article V_ of these By-laws, each Non-
Officer Employee may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, be
indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against any or all Expenses
and Liabilities that are incurred by such Non-Officer Employee or on such
Non-Officer Employee's behalf in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed Proceeding, or any claim, issue or matter therein, which such Non-
Officer Employee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant
in by reason of such Non-Officer Employee's Corporate Status, if such Non-
Officer Employee acted in good faith and in a manner such Non-Officer
Employee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The rights
of indemnification provided by this _Section 3_ shall exist as to a Non-

shall be provided pursuant to this _Article V_ to a Director, to an
Officer or to a Non-Officer Employee unless a determination shall have been
made that such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, such person had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
determination shall be made by (a) a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, (b)
a committee comprised of Disinterested Directors, such committee having been
designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (even though
less than a quorum), (c) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, or if a
majority of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

Section 5. _Advancement of Expenses to Directors Prior to Final
Disposition_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of
any Director in connection with any Proceeding in which such Director is
involved by reason of such Director's Corporate Status within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Corporation of a written statement from such
Director requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior
to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or
statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Director
and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Director to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Director is not entitled to be indemnified against such
Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance all
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Director seeking advancement of
expenses hereunder in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director
only if such Proceeding (including any parts of such Proceeding not initiated
by such Director) was (i) authorized by the Board of Directors, or (ii)
brought to enforce such Director's rights to indemnification or advancement
of Expenses under these By-laws.

  



  

(b) If a claim for advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director is not
paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Corporation of documentation of Expenses and the required undertaking, such
Director may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and if successful in whole or in part,
such Director shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting
or defending such suit. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such
advancement of Expenses under this _Article V_ shall not be a defense to an
action brought by a Director for recovery of the unpaid amount of an
advancement claim and shall not create a presumption that such advancement is
not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director is not entitled to an
advancement of expenses shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

(c) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Director
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
DGCL.

  



  

Section 6. _Advancement of Expenses to Officers and Non-Officer Employees
Prior to Final Disposition_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, advance
any or all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Officer or any Non-
Officer Employee in connection with any Proceeding in which such person is
involved by reason of his or her Corporate Status as an Officer or Non-
Officer Employee upon the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or
statements from such Officer or Non-Officer Employee requesting such advance
or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of
such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the
Expenses incurred by such Officer or Non-Officer Employee and shall be
preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to
repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Officer or Non-Officer Employee is not entitled to be indemnified against
such Expenses.

  



  

(b) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Officer
or Non-Officer Employee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7. _Contractual Nature of Rights_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this _Article V_ shall be deemed to be a contract
between the Corporation and each Director and Officer entitled to the
benefits hereof at any time while this _Article V_ is in effect, in
consideration of such person's past or current and any future performance of
services for the Corporation. Neither amendment, repeal or modification of any
provision of this _Article V_ nor the adoption of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this _Article V_ shall
eliminate or reduce any right conferred by this _Article V_ in respect of any
act or omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim that accrues or
arises or any state of facts existing, at the time of or before such
amendment, repeal, modification or adoption of an inconsistent provision
(even in the case of a proceeding based on such a state of facts that
is commenced after such time), and all rights to indemnification and
advancement of Expenses granted herein or arising out of any act or omission
shall vest at the time of the act or omission in question, regardless of when
or if any proceeding with respect to such act or omission is commenced. The
rights to indemnification and to advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this _Article V_ shall continue notwithstanding that the
person has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall
inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees
and distributes of such person.

  



  

   

16

 



    

  



  

(b) If a claim for indemnification (following final disposition of such
Proceeding) or advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director or Officer is
not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after receipt by
the Corporation of a written claim for indemnification or advancement of
Expenses, such Director or Officer may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if
successful in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
such Director or Officer shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting or defending such suit. The failure of the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such
indemnification under this _Article V_ shall not be a defense to an action
brought by a Director or Officer for recovery of the unpaid amount of an
indemnification claim and shall not create a presumption that such
indemnification is not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director or
Officer is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses shall
be on the Corporation.

  



  

(c) In any suit brought by a Director or Officer to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder, it shall be a defense that such Director or
Officer has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in
the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
advancement of Expenses set forth in this _Article V_ shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any Director, Officer, or Non-Officer
Employee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate or these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise.

  



  

Section 9. _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee
against any liability of any character asserted against or incurred by the
Corporation or any such Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee, or arising
out of any such person's Corporate Status, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under
the DGCL or the provisions of this _Article V_.

  



  

Section 10. _Other Indemnification_. Subject to any other right which any
Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee may have or hereafter acquire under
any statute, provision of the Certificate or these By-laws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise to the contrary, the
Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or provide advancement of
Expenses to any person under this _Article V_ as a result of such person
serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by
any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of
Expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or enterprise (the " _Primary Indemnitor_ "). Subject to
any other right which any Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate or these
By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or
otherwise to the contrary, any indemnification or advancement of Expenses
under this _Article V_ owed by the Corporation as a result of a person
serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall only be in
excess of, and shall be secondary to, the indemnification or advancement of
Expenses available from the applicable Primary Indemnitor(s) and any
applicable insurance policies.

comply with applicable foreign laws; (iv) establish subplans and modify
exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent the
Administrator determines such actions to be necessary or advisable (and such
subplans and/or modifications shall be attached to this Plan as
appendices); provided, however, that no such subplans and/or modifications
shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 3(a) hereof; and
(v) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that the Administrator
determines to be necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with any
local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder, and no
Awards shall be granted, that would violate the Exchange Act or any other
applicable United States securities law, the Code, or any other applicable
United States governing statute or law.

SECTION 3. STOCK ISSUABLE UNDER THE PLAN; MERGERS; SUBSTITUTION

  



  

(a)  _Stock Issuable_. The maximum number of shares of Stock reserved and
available for issuance under the Plan shall be _____9 shares (the "Initial
Limit"), subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 3, plus on January
1, 2022 and each January 1 thereafter, the number of shares of Stock reserved
and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by
(i) four (4%) percent of the number of shares of Stock issued and outstanding
on the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) such lesser number of shares
as determined by the Administrator (the "Annual Increase"). Subject to
such overall limitation, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that
may be issued in the form of Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed the
Initial Limit subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b). For purposes
of this limitation, the shares of Stock underlying any awards under the Plan
that are forfeited, canceled, held back upon exercise of an option or
settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding,
reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of
Stock or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) shall be added back to
the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan and, to the extent
permitted under Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the shares of Stock that may be issued as Incentive Stock
Options. In the event the Company repurchases shares of Stock on the open
market, such shares shall not be added to the shares of Stock available for
issuance under the Plan. Subject to such overall limitations, shares of Stock
may be issued up to such maximum number pursuant to any type or types of
Award. The shares available for issuance under the Plan may be authorized but
unissued shares of Stock or shares of Stock reacquired by the Company.

  



  

(b)  _Changes in Stock_. Subject to Section 3(c) hereof, if, as a result of
any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the Company's capital
stock, the outstanding shares of Stock are increased or decreased or are
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of
the Company, or additional shares or new or different shares or other
securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with
respect to such shares of Stock or other securities, or, if, as a result of
any merger or consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company, the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or
exchanged for securities of the Company or any successor entity (or a parent
or subsidiary thereof), the Administrator shall make an appropriate or
proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of shares reserved for
issuance under the Plan, including the maximum number of shares that may be
issued in the form of Incentive Stock Options, (ii) the number and kind of
shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding Awards under the
Plan, (iii) the repurchase price, if any, per share subject to each
outstanding Restricted Stock Award, and (iv) the exercise price for each
share subject to any then outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights under the Plan, without changing the aggregate exercise price (i.e.,
the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares subject to Stock Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights) as to which such Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights remain exercisable. The Administrator shall also make
equitable or proportionate adjustments in the number of shares subject to
outstanding Awards and the exercise price and the terms of outstanding Awards
to take into consideration cash dividends paid other than in the ordinary
course or any other extraordinary corporate event. The adjustment by the
Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares of
Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but
the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares.

(c)  _Mergers and Other Transactions_. In the case of and subject to the
consummation of a Sale Event, the parties thereto may cause the assumption or
continuation of Awards theretofore granted by the successor entity, or the
substitution of such Awards with new Awards of the successor entity or parent
thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares
and, if appropriate, the per share exercise prices, as such parties shall
agree. To the extent the parties to such Sale Event do not provide for the
assumption, continuation or substitution of Awards, upon the effective time of
the Sale Event, the Plan and all outstanding Awards granted hereunder shall
terminate. In such case, except as may be otherwise provided in the relevant
Award Certificate, all Awards with time-based vesting, conditions or
restrictions shall become fully vested and exercisable or nonforfeitable as
of the effective time of the Sale Event, and all Awards with conditions and
restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become
vested and exercisable or nonforfeitable in connection with a Sale Event in
the Administrator's discretion or to the extent specified in the relevant
Award Certificate. In the event of such termination, (i) the Company shall
have the option (in its sole discretion) to make or provide for a payment, in
cash or in kind, to the grantees holding Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the
difference between (A) the Sale Price multiplied by the number of shares of
Stock subject to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the
extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B)
the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights (provided that, in the case of an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Sale
Price, such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be cancelled for no
consideration); or (ii) each grantee shall be permitted, within a specified
period of time prior to the consummation of the Sale Event as determined by
the Administrator, to exercise all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights (to the extent then exercisable) held by such grantee. The Company
shall also have the option (in its sole discretion) to make or provide for a
payment, in cash or in kind, to the grantees holding other Awards in an
amount equal to the Sale Price multiplied by the number of vested shares of
Stock under such Awards.

  



  

(d)  _Maximum Awards to Non-Employee Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Plan, the value of all Awards awarded under this Plan
and all other cash compensation paid by the Company to any Non-Employee
Director in any calendar year for service as a Non-Employee Director shall
not exceed $_____, provided, however that such amount shall be $_____ for the
calendar year in which the applicable Non-Employee Director is initially
elected or appointed to the Board. For the purpose of this limitation, the
value of any Award shall be its grant date fair value, as determined in
accordance with FASB ASC 718 or successor provision but excluding the impact
of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting provisions.

  



  

SECTION 4. ELIGIBILITY

  



  

Grantees under the Plan will be such employees, Non-Employee Directors and
Consultants of the Company and its Affiliates as are selected from time to
time by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided that Awards may not
be granted to employees, Directors or Consultants who are providing services
only to any "parent" of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 of
the Act, unless (i) the stock underlying the Awards is treated as "service
recipient stock" under Section 409A or (ii) the Company, in consultation with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Awards are exempt from or
otherwise comply with Section 409A.

  



  

SECTION 5. STOCK OPTIONS

  



  

(a)  _Award of Stock Options_. The Administrator may grant Stock Options
under the Plan. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form
as the Administrator may from time to time approve.

  



  

Stock Options granted under the Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or
Non-Qualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a "subsidiary corporation"
within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code. To the extent that any
Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall be deemed a
Non-Qualified Stock Option.

  



  

Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator
shall deem desirable. If the Administrator so determines, Stock Options may
be granted in lieu of cash compensation at the optionee's election,
subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.

  



    

6

 



    



  

(b)  _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per share for the Stock covered by
a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be determined by the
Administrator at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100 percent of
the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. In the case of an Incentive Stock
Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the exercise price of
such Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair
Market Value on the grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stock Options
may be granted with an exercise price per share that is less than 100 percent
of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant (i) pursuant to a transaction
described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code,
(ii) to individuals who are not subject to U.S. income tax on the date of
grant, or (iii) if the Stock Option is otherwise compliant with Section 409A.

  



  

(c)  _Option Term_. The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the
Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years
after the date the Stock Option is granted. In the case of an Incentive Stock
Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the term of such Stock Option
shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.

  



  

(d)  _Exercisability; Rights of a Stockholder_. Stock Options shall become
exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall
be determined by the Administrator at or after the grant date. The
Administrator may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any
portion of any Stock Option. An optionee shall have the rights of a
stockholder only as to shares acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option
and not as to unexercised Stock Options.

  



  

(e)  _Method of Exercise_. Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in
part, by giving written or electronic notice of exercise to the Company,
specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price
may be made by one or more of the following methods except to the extent
otherwise provided in the Option Award Certificate:

  



  

(i)  In cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to
the Administrator;

  



  

(ii) Through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership following such
procedures as the Company may prescribe) of shares of Stock that are not then
subject to restrictions under any Company plan. Such surrendered shares shall
be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date;

  



  

(iii) By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise
notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver
to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the
purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay the
purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with
such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other
agreements as the Company shall prescribe as a condition of such payment
procedure; or

  



  

(iv) With respect to Stock Options that are not Incentive Stock Options, by a
"net exercise" arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number
of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate
exercise price.

  



  

Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. The transfer to
the optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the
shares of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option
will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in
his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the
Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any
other requirements contained in the Option Award Certificate or
applicable provisions of laws (including the satisfaction of any withholding
taxes that the Company is obligated to withhold with respect to the
optionee). In the event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by
previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number
of shares of Stock transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock
Option shall be net of the number of attested shares. In the event that the
Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an
automated system for the exercise of Stock Options, such as a system using an
internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless exercise
of Stock Options may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.

  



  

   

7

 



    

  



  

(f)   _Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options_. To the extent required for
"incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the
aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the shares
of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this
Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent and
subsidiary corporations become exercisable for the first time by an optionee
during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that any
Stock Option exceeds this limit, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock
Option.

  



  

SECTION 6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

  



  

(a)  _Award of Stock Appreciation Rights_. The Administrator may grant Stock
Appreciation Rights under the Plan. A Stock Appreciation Right is an Award
entitling the recipient to receive shares of Stock (or cash, to the extent
explicitly provided for in the applicable Award Certificate) having a value
equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date
of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right
multiplied by the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the
Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised.

  



  

(b)  _Exercise Price of Stock Appreciation Rights_. The exercise price of a
Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair
Market Value of the Stock on the date of grant.

  



  

(c)  _Grant and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights_. Stock Appreciation
Rights may be granted by the Administrator independently of any Stock Option
granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan.

  



  

(d)  _Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights_. Stock Appreciation
Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined
on the date of grant by the Administrator. The term of a Stock Appreciation
Right may not exceed ten years. The terms and conditions of each such Award
shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may
differ among individual Awards and grantees.

  



  

SECTION 7. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

  



  

(a)  _Nature of Restricted Stock Awards_. The Administrator may grant
Restricted Stock Awards under the Plan. A Restricted Stock Award is any Award
of Restricted Shares subject to such restrictions and conditions as the
Administrator may determine at the time of grant. Conditions may be based on
continuing employment (or other Service Relationship) and/or achievement of
pre-established performance goals and objectives.

  



  

(b)  _Rights as a Stockholder_. Upon the grant of the Restricted Stock Award
and payment of any applicable purchase price, a grantee shall have the rights
of a stockholder with respect to the voting of the Restricted Shares and
receipt of dividends; provided that if the lapse of restrictions with respect
to the Restricted Stock Award is tied to the attainment of performance goals,
any dividends paid by the Company during the performance period shall accrue
and shall not be paid to the grantee until and to the extent the performance
goals are met with respect to the Restricted Stock Award. Unless the
Administrator shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted Shares
shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the
transfer agent to the effect that they are subject to forfeiture until such
Restricted Shares are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii)
certificated Restricted Shares shall remain in the possession of the Company
until such Restricted Shares are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below,
and the grantee shall be required, as a condition of the grant, to deliver to
the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.

  



  

   

8

 



    

  



  

(c)  _Restrictions_. Restricted Shares may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as
specifically provided herein or in the Restricted Stock Award Certificate.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award
Certificate or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing after the Award is
issued, if a grantee's employment (or other Service Relationship) with the
Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted
Shares that have not vested at the time of termination shall automatically
and without any requirement of notice to such grantee from or other action by
or on behalf of, the Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company
at their original purchase price (if any) from such grantee or such grantee's
legal representative simultaneously with such termination of employment
(or other Service Relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any
ownership of the Company by the grantee or rights of the grantee as a
stockholder. Following such deemed reacquisition of Restricted Shares that are
represented by physical certificates, a grantee shall surrender such
certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.

  



  

(d)  _Vesting of Restricted Shares_. The Administrator at the time of grant
shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established
performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-
transferability of the Restricted Shares and the Company's right of
repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse. Subsequent to such date or dates and/or
the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and
other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no
longer be Restricted Shares and shall be deemed "vested."

  



  

SECTION 8. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

  



  

(a)  _Nature of Restricted Stock Units_. The Administrator may grant
Restricted Stock Units under the Plan. A Restricted Stock Unit is an Award of
stock units that may be settled in shares of Stock (or cash, to the extent
explicitly provided for in the Award Certificate) upon the satisfaction of
such restrictions and conditions at the time of grant. Conditions may be based
on continuing employment (or other Service Relationship) and/or achievement
of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The terms and conditions
of each such Award shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms
and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees. Except in the
case of Restricted Stock Units with a deferred settlement date that
complies with Section 409A, at the end of the vesting period, the Restricted
Stock Units, to the extent vested, shall be settled in the form of shares of
Stock. Restricted Stock Units with deferred settlement dates are subject to
Section 409A and shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the
Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion in order to comply with
the requirements of Section 409A.

  



  

(b)  _Election to Receive Restricted Stock Units in Lieu of Compensation_.
The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a grantee to elect to
receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to such grantee in
the form of an award of Restricted Stock Units. Any such election shall be
made in writing and shall be delivered to the Company no later than the date
specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such
other rules and procedures established by the Administrator. Any such future
cash compensation that the grantee elects to defer shall be converted to a
fixed number of Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value of
Stock on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the
grantee if such payment had not been deferred as provided herein. The
Administrator shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what
circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and
other terms and conditions thereon as the Administrator deems
appropriate. Any Restricted Stock Units that are elected to be received in
lieu of cash compensation shall be fully vested, unless otherwise provided in
the Award Certificate.

  



    

9

 



    



  

(c)  _Rights as a Stockholder_. A grantee shall have the rights as a
stockholder only as to shares of Stock acquired by the grantee upon
settlement of Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that the grantee may
be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the stock units
underlying his or her Restricted Stock Units, subject to the provisions of
Section 11 and such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine.

  



  

(d)  _Termination_. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator
either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing
after the Award is issued, a grantee's right in all Restricted Stock Units
that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's
termination of employment (or cessation of Service Relationship) with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

  



  

SECTION 9. UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

  



  

 _Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Stock_. The Administrator may grant (or sell
at par value or such higher purchase price determined by the Administrator)
an Unrestricted Stock Award under the Plan. An Unrestricted Stock Award is an
Award pursuant to which the grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any
restrictions under the Plan. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted in
respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash
compensation due to such grantee.

  



  

SECTION 10. CASH-BASED AWARDS

  



  

 _Grant of Cash-Based Awards_. The Administrator may grant Cash-Based Awards
under the Plan. A Cash-Based Award is an Award that entitles the grantee to a
payment in cash upon the attainment of specified performance goals. The
Administrator shall determine the maximum duration of the Cash-Based Award,
the amount of cash to which the Cash-Based Award pertains, the conditions upon
which the Cash-Based Award shall become vested or payable, and such other
provisions as the Administrator shall determine. Each Cash-Based Award
shall specify a cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges as
determined by the Administrator. Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-
Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award and may be
made in cash.

  



  

SECTION 11. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

  



  

(a)  _Dividend Equivalent Rights_. The Administrator may grant Dividend
Equivalent Rights under the Plan. A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award
entitling the grantee to receive credits based on cash dividends that would
have been paid on the shares of Stock specified in the Dividend Equivalent
Right (or other Award to which it relates) if such shares had been issued to
the grantee. A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any
grantee as a component of an award of Restricted Stock Units or as a
freestanding award. The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights
shall be specified in the Award Certificate. Dividend equivalents credited to
the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be
deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of Stock, which may thereafter
accrue additional equivalents. Any such reinvestment shall be at Fair Market
Value on the date of reinvestment or such other price as may then apply under
a dividend reinvestment plan sponsored by the Company, if any. Dividend
Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or shares of Stock or a combination
thereof, in a single installment or installments. A Dividend Equivalent Right
granted as a component of an Award of Restricted Stock Units shall provide
that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled only upon settlement or
payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that such
Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the
same conditions as such other Award.

  



  

(b)  _Termination_. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator
either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing
after the Award is issued, a grantee's rights in all Dividend Equivalent
Rights shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of
employment (or cessation of Service Relationship) with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any reason.

  



  

   

10

 



    

  



  

SECTION 12. _TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS_

  



  

(a)  _Transferability_. Except as provided in Section 12(b) below, during a
grantee's lifetime, his or her Awards shall be exercisable only by the
grantee, or by the grantee's legal representative or guardian in the event of
the grantee's incapacity. No Awards shall be sold, assigned, transferred or
otherwise encumbered or disposed of by a grantee other than by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order. No
Awards shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or
levy of any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be null
and void.

  



  

(b)  _Administrator Action_. Notwithstanding Section 12(a), the
Administrator, in its discretion, may provide either in the Award Certificate
regarding a given Award or by subsequent written approval that the grantee
(who is an employee or director) may transfer his or her Non-Qualified Stock
Options to his or her immediate family members, to trusts for the benefit of
such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the
only partners, provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the
Company to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the
applicable Award. In no event may an Award be transferred by a grantee for
value.

  



  

(c)  _Family Member_. For purposes of Section 12(b), "family member" shall
mean a grantee's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent,
grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law,
including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the grantee's
household (other than a tenant of the grantee), a trust in which these
persons (or the grantee) have more than 50 percent of the
beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the grantee)
control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons
(or the grantee) own more than 50 percent of the voting interests.

  



  

(d)  _Designation of Beneficiary_. To the extent permitted by the Company,
each grantee to whom an Award has been made under the Plan may designate a
beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive any payment
under any Award payable on or after the grantee's death. Any such designation
shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the Administrator and shall
not be effective until received by the Administrator. If no beneficiary has
been designated by a deceased grantee, or if the designated beneficiaries
have predeceased the grantee, the beneficiary shall be the grantee's estate.

  



  

SECTION 13. _TAX WITHHOLDING_

  



  

(a)  _Payment by Grantee_. Each grantee shall, no later than the date as of
which the value of an Award or of any Stock or other amount received
thereunder first becomes includable in the gross income of the grantee for
income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to
the Administrator regarding payment of, any Federal, state, or local taxes of
any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect to such
income. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by
law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind
otherwise due to the grantee. The Company's obligation to deliver evidence of
book entry (or stock certificates) to any grantee is subject to and
conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by the grantee.

  



  

(b)  _Payment in Stock_. The Administrator may require the Company's tax
withholding obligation to be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the Company
withholding from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number
of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding
is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due; provided,
however, that the amount withheld does not exceed the maximum statutory tax
rate or such lesser amount as is necessary to avoid liability accounting
treatment. For purposes of share withholding, the Fair Market Value of
withheld shares shall be determined in the same manner as the value of Stock
includible in income of the grantees. The Administrator may also require the
Company's tax withholding obligation to be satisfied, in whole or in part, by
an arrangement whereby a certain number of shares of Stock issued pursuant to
any Award are immediately sold and proceeds from such sale are remitted to the
Company in an amount that would satisfy the withholding amount due.

  



  

   

11

 



    

  



  

SECTION 14. _SECTION 409A AWARDS_

  



  

Awards are intended to be exempt from Section 409A to the greatest extent
possible and to otherwise comply with Section 409A. The Plan and all Awards
shall be interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that any
Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within
the meaning of Section 409A (a "409A Award"), the Award shall be subject to
such additional rules and requirements as specified by the Administrator from
time to time in order to comply with Section 409A. In this regard, if any
amount under a 409A Award is payable upon a "separation from service" (within
the meaning of Section 409A) to a grantee who is then considered a "specified
employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then no such payment shall be
made prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after
the grantee's separation from service, or (ii) the grantee's death, but only
to the extent such delay is necessary to prevent such payment from
being subject to interest, penalties and/or additional tax imposed pursuant
to Section 409A. Further, the settlement of any 409A Award may not be
accelerated except to the extent permitted by Section 409A.

  



  

SECTION 15. _TERMINATION OF SERVICE RELATIONSHIP, TRANSFER, LEAVE OF ABSENCE,
ETC._

  



  

(a)  _Termination of Service Relationship_. If the grantee's Service
Relationship is with an Affiliate and such Affiliate ceases to be an
Affiliate, the grantee shall be deemed to have terminated his or her Service
Relationship for purposes of the Plan.

  



  

(b) For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a
termination of a Service Relationship:

  



  

(i)  a transfer to the employment of the Company from an Affiliate or from
the Company to an Affiliate, or from one Affiliate to another; or

  



  

(ii) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for
any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-
employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the
policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the
Administrator otherwise so provides in writing.

  



  

SECTION 16. _AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION_

  



  

The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Plan and the
Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the
purpose of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no
such action shall materially and adversely affect rights under any
outstanding Award without the holder's consent. The Administrator is
specifically authorized to exercise its discretion to reduce the exercise
price of outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or effect the
repricing of such Awards through cancellation and re-grants. To the extent
required under the rules of any securities exchange or market system on which
the Stock is listed, to the extent determined by the Administrator to be
required by the Code to ensure that Incentive Stock Options granted under the
Plan are qualified under Section 422 of the Code, Plan amendments shall be
subject to approval by Company stockholders. Nothing in this Section 16 shall
limit the Administrator's authority to take any action permitted pursuant to
Section 3(b) or 3(c).

SECTION 17. _STATUS OF PLAN_

  



  

With respect to the portion of any Award that has not been exercised and any
payments in cash, Stock or other consideration not received by a grantee, a
grantee shall have no rights greater than those of a general creditor of the
Company unless the Administrator shall otherwise expressly determine in
connection with any Award or Awards. In its sole discretion, the Administrator
may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the
Company's obligations to deliver Stock or make payments with respect to
Awards hereunder, provided that the existence of such trusts or other
arrangements is consistent with the foregoing sentence.

  



  

SECTION 18. _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  



  

(a)  _No Distribution_. The Administrator may require each person acquiring
Stock pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in
writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to
distribution thereof.

  



  

(b)  _Issuance of Stock_. To the extent certificated, stock certificates to
grantees under this Plan shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the
Company or a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have mailed such
certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the
grantee's last known address on file with the Company. Uncertificated Stock
shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a Stock
transfer agent of the Company shall have given to the grantee by electronic
mail (with proof of receipt) or by United States mail, addressed to the
grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company, notice
of issuance and recorded the issuance in its records (which may include
electronic "book entry" records). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any evidence
of book entry or certificates evidencing shares of Stock pursuant to the
exercise or settlement of any Award, unless and until the Administrator has
determined, with advice of counsel (to the extent the Administrator deems such
advice necessary or advisable), that the issuance and delivery is in
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental
authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the
shares of Stock are listed, quoted or traded. Any Stock issued pursuant to
the Plan shall be subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions
as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal,
state or foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and quotation
system on which the Stock is listed, quoted or traded. The Administrator may
place legends on any Stock certificate or notations on any book entry to
reference restrictions applicable to the Stock. In addition to the terms and
conditions provided herein, the Administrator may require that an individual
make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the
Administrator, in its discretion, deems necessary or advisable in order to
comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements. The Administrator
shall have the right to require any individual to comply with any timing or
other restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any Award,
including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of
the Administrator.

  



  

(c)  _Stockholder Rights_. Until Stock is deemed delivered in accordance with
Section 18(b), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights of a
stockholder will exist with respect to shares of Stock to be issued in
connection with an Award, notwithstanding the exercise of a Stock Option or
any other action by the grantee with respect to an Award.

  



  

(d)  _Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights_. Nothing
contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or
additional compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements
may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The
adoption of this Plan and the grant of Awards do not confer upon any employee
any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary.

  



  

(e)  _Trading Policy Restrictions_. Option exercises and other Awards under
the Plan shall be subject to the Company's insider trading policies and
procedures, as in effect from time to time.

  



    

13

 



    



  

(f)   _Clawback Policy_. Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the
Company's clawback policy, as in effect from time to time.

  



  

SECTION 19. _EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN_

  



  

This Plan shall become effective upon the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date, subject to prior stockholder approval in accordance with
applicable state law, the Company's bylaws and articles of incorporation, and
applicable stock exchange rules. No grants of Stock Options and other Awards
may be made hereunder after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date and no
grants of Incentive Stock Options may be made hereunder after the tenth
anniversary of the date the Plan is approved by the Board.

  



  

SECTION 20. _GOVERNING LAW_

  



  

This Plan and all Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as to matters within the scope thereof, and as to all other matters
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, applied without regard to conflict of law
principles.

Article II 
 LOCKUP

  



  

2.1 _Lockup_.

  



   | (a)| Each  Stockholder Party agrees that such Stockholder Party shall
not Transfer any Covered Equity  Interest or any securities convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable (directly  or indirectly) for any Covered
Equity Interest (whether such Covered Equity Interest  or any such securities
are held by such Stockholder Party as of the date hereof or are  thereafter
acquired) from the date hereof and ending one-hundred eighty (180) days
following  the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "). The foregoing
restriction  is expressly agreed to preclude each Stockholder Party during
the Lock-up Period from  engaging in any hedging or other transaction which
is designed to or which reasonably  could be expected to lead to or result in
a sale or disposition of such Stockholder Party's  Covered Equity Interest
even if such Covered Equity Interest would be disposed of by  someone other
than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions during 
the Lock-up Period would include without limitation any short sale or any
purchase, sale  or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any put
or call option) with respect  to any of the Stockholder Party's Covered
Equity Interest or with respect to any  security that includes, relates to,
or derives any significant part of its value from  such Covered Equity
Interest. The foregoing notwithstanding, each executive officer and  director
of FSD shall be permitted to establish a plan to acquire and sell Covered
Equity  Interest pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, no sale of  any Covered Equity Interest under any such plan shall be
made prior to the expiration  of the Lock-Up Period. For purposes of this
agreement, " _Transfer_ "  means to (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or
agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant  any option to purchase or
otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly,  or
establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a
call equivalent  position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations  of the Commission promulgated thereunder,
with respect to any Covered Equity Interest,  (ii) enter into any swap or
other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or  in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any Covered Equity Interest,  whether
any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in
cash  or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any
transaction, including  the filing of a registration statement specified in
clause (i) or (ii). Notwithstanding  the foregoing, a Transfer shall not be
deemed to include any transfer for no consideration  if the donee, trustee,
heir or other transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by  the same terms
under this Agreement to the extent and for the duration that such terms 
remain in effect at the time of the Transfer, by executing and delivering the
Form of  Joinder Agreement set forth on Exhibit B to the FSD. 
---|---|--- 
  

  

  



   | (b)| Each  Stockholder Party also agrees and consents to the entry of
stop transfer instructions  with FSD's transfer agent and registrar against
the transfer of any Covered Equity  INterest except in compliance with the
foregoing restrictions and to the addition of  a legend to such Stockholder
Party's Covered Equity Interest describing the foregoing  restrictions. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Article III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDER PARTIES

  



  

3.1. _Stockholder Representations and Warranties_. Each Stockholder Party
represents and warrants to FSD as follows:

  



   | (a)| If  Stockholder Party is not an individual, the Stockholder
Party is a corporation, limited  liability company or other applicable
business entity duly organized or formed, as applicable,  validly existing
and in good standing (or the equivalent thereof, if applicable, in each 
case, with respect to the jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing or  any equivalent thereof) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
formation or organization  (as applicable). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If  Stockholder Party is not an individual, the Stockholder
Party has the requisite corporate,  limited liability company or other
similar power and authority to execute and deliver  this Agreement, to
perform its covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder (including,  for
the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder
that  relate to the provisions of the Merger Agreement), and to consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement has been duly authorized  by all necessary corporate (or other
similar) action on the part of such Stockholder  Party. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder  Party and
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of each Stockholder Party 
(assuming that this Agreement is duly authorized, executed and delivered by
FSD), enforceable  against each such Stockholder Party in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting generally  the enforcement of creditors'
rights and subject to general principles of equity). 
---|---|---

   | (c)| Each  Stockholder Party is the record and beneficial owner of
the Gemini Equity Interests set  forth opposite such Stockholder Party's name
on _Exhibit A_ hereto and has  valid, good and marketable title to the Gemini
Equity Interests, free and clear of all  Liens (other than transfer
restrictions under applicable Securities Law). Each Stockholder  Party is not
party to or bound by (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, or other
Contract that would (either alone or in connection with one or more events,
developments (including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions
precedent)) require such Stockholder Party to Transfer any of the Covered
Equity Interests or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or other Contract with
respect to the voting or Transfer of any of the Covered Equity Interests.

Party hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon termination or
expiration of this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement; provided, however, that such termination or
expiration shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement occurring prior to its termination.

  



  

4.2. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall
be deemed to have been duly given) by delivery in person, by facsimile

   | (b)| Except  as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the
failure nor delay on the part of  any party hereto to exercise any right,
remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement  shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy power
or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any waiver of any right,
remedy, power or privilege with respect to any occurrence be construed as a
waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any other
occurrence. 
---|---|--- 
  

  

  



   | (c)| No  party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out
of this Agreement, or any  right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim,  right, remedy, power or

delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be

arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and
(ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder may not be enforced in
