AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
February 13, 2017, by and among: Allergan Holdco US, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"); Blizzard Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and

in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

(the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in
the merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided
in Section 1.5, (i) each issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest and (ii)
the Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of
the Merger.

B. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are advisable to, and in
the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve the adoption of this
Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation").

C. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,
to enter into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

| 
---|--- 

Section 1.

|

MERGER TRANSACTION 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the Merger, whereby
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
Surviving Corporation.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time.

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 7,
and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by Legal Requirement) of the conditions set forth in Section 6, the
consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Cooley LLP, 3175 Hanover St., Palo Alto, CA 94304, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time,
on the second (2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by Legal Requirement) of the conditions set forth in Section
6 (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing). The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file or cause to be filed
a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the
Parties shall take all such further actions as may be required by Legal
Requirement to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall become effective
upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is
agreed upon in writing by the Parties and specified in the certificate of
merger (such date and time, the "Effective Time").

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit B;

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(c) the directors of Merger Sub and the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively,
of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each director of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company to be effective as of the Effective Time.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock ("Shares") then held by the Company (or
held in the Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 1.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting Shares,
as defined below) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
$56.50 per share in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration") upon
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 1.6, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 1.6(e); and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
then outstanding shall be converted automatically into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.5. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable
pursuant to Section 1.5 (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; provided, that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of
the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall be paid solely to Parent.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of the Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 (i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the shares of Company
Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Legal Requirements, and such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled.

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by
a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such
payor shall request such information from such payee and use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other recipient of
consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e)), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 1.

1.7 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held
by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less
any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e)),
and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall
give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares (or written threats thereof), withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting
Shares, and (b) the right to participate in proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make or agree to make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the
Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall
provide each of the holders of Company Common Stock with the notice
contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL as part of the Proxy Statement. 

1.8 Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs.

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised vested Company Option shall automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option,
without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. In the
event that the exercise price of any Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled, without
any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force
or effect.

(b) Each unvested Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder
of any Company Option, into an option (a "Allergan Stock Option") to purchase
Ordinary Shares of Allergan plc ("Allergan Common Stock"), on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option (but taking into
account any changes thereto, including any acceleration or vesting thereof,
provided for in the relevant Company Equity Plan, or in the related award
document (including any employment agreement or retention policy) by reason of
the Transactions). The number of shares of Allergan Common Stock subject to
each such Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each corresponding Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share of Allergan Common Stock), and such Allergan Stock Option
shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal
to the per share exercise price specified in the corresponding Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio;
provided, that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the
Code applies as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of
any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 or Section 423 of the Code, the exercise price, the number
of shares of Allergan Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; provided,
further, that the exercise price, the number of shares of Allergan Common
Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of each Company
Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code.

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each vested
Company RSU that is then outstanding shall automatically be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding.

(d) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted at the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU, into an award
of restricted stock units (a "Allergan RSU") with respect to Allergan Common
Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
RSU (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration
or vesting thereof, provided for in the relevant Company Equity Plan, or in
the related award document (including any employment agreement or retention
policy) by reason of the Transactions). The number of shares of Allergan
Common Stock subject to each such Allergan RSU shall be equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each corresponding Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share of Allergan Common Stock; provided,
further, that the conversion of the Allergan RSUs set forth herein shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code.

(e) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company PSU
that is then outstanding and unvested shall vest with respect to the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be earned thereunder and
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal
to the product of (i) the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
then underlying such Company PSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding.

(f) The Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments
contemplated by the foregoing Section 1.8(a), Section 1.8(c) and Section
1.8(e) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the Effective Time and (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain at all times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid
funds to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 1.8(a), Section 1.8(c)
and Section 1.8(e).

(g) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Options, Company
RSUs or Company PSUs a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such
equity awards pursuant to this Section 1.8 and providing instructions for use
in obtaining payment therefor.

(h) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. Law in a manner other than that
contemplated above in this Section 1.8 to the extent necessary to take into
account applicable non-U.S. Law or Tax or employment considerations.

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

2.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

(a) Since January 1, 2016, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by the Company with the SEC (the "Company SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents and,
except to the extent that information contained in such Company SEC Document
has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this
Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC
Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange
Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the
case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material). No
financial statements of any Person other than the Company are required by GAAP
to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2016 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. The Company's management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and
the Company's independent public accountant has issued (and not subsequently
withdrawn or qualified) a report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January 1, 2016,
neither the Company nor the Company's independent registered accountant has
identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company; (2) any illegal act or fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the management or other employees of the Company;
or (3) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(e) The Company is not a party to nor has any obligation or other commitment
to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company in the Company's published financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company.

(g) The proxy statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
"Proxy Statement"), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed,
distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The
Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing or any supplement or amendment
thereto with the SEC and at the time such Proxy Statement or any supplements
or amendments thereto are first distributed or disseminated to the Company's
stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

2.5 Absence of Changes. Since September 30, 2016, through the date of this

to this Agreement or other potential strategic transactions, the Acquired
Corporations have operated in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (b) there has not occurred any event,
change, action, failure to act or transaction that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had a Material Adverse Effect and (c) except for discussions,
negotiations and transactions related to this Agreement or other potential

2.6 Title to Assets. The Acquired Corporations have good and valid title to
all assets owned by them as of the date of this Agreement, including all
assets (other than capitalized or operating leases) reflected on the Company's

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Balance Sheet") filed by the Company with
the SEC but excluding intellectual property which is covered by Section 2.8,

business since the date of such Balance Sheet and except where such failure
would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Part 2.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all leases, subleases and other agreements under which any
Acquired Corporation uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now
or in the future, any real property (the "Leased Real Property"). Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Acquired Corporations hold a valid and existing leasehold interest in the
Leased Real Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. None of the Acquired Corporations have received any written
notice regarding any violation or breach or default under any Company Lease
that has not since been cured, except for violations or breaches that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

patent applications included in the Registered IP that are owned solely by an
Acquired Corporation (and each of such Acquired Corporations' co-owned patents
and patent applications) properly identifies by name each and every inventor
of the claims thereof as determined in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements of the United States. The Acquired Corporations solely and
exclusively own and possess all right, title and interest in and to or have
the right to use, pursuant to a valid written agreement, all material Company

and any Encumbrances caused or created by any action or failure to act by any
Person other than the Acquired Corporations; and (y) Company IP validly

contested or challenged. All Company IP owned or purported to be owned by any
Acquired Corporation is (x) subsisting and (y) to the knowledge of the
Company, all (i) issued patents, (ii) registered trademarks, and (iii)
registered copyrights material to the business of the Acquired Corporations
that, in each case, are included in Company IP and that are owned or purported

claimed in any patent or patent application included in the Registered IP, or
(ii), an employee of any Acquired Company or individual independent contractor
working directly with any Acquired Company and who is or was developer or

Trade Secret, that, in each case, is material to the business of the Acquired
Corporations and that, in each case, is included in the Company IP owned or
purported to be owned by an Acquired Corporation has signed a written
agreement containing an assignment of applicable Intellectual Property Rights
(or is or was otherwise obligated by applicable law to assign such
Intellectual Property Rights) to either an Acquired Corporation or an Entity
that has signed a written agreement containing an assignment of such
Intellectual Property Rights to an Acquired Corporation and confidentiality
provisions protecting the Company IP, which, to the knowledge of the Company,
has not been breached by such Company Associate. Each Acquired Corporation has
taken commercially reasonable actions to maintain the confidentiality of all
Trade Secrets owned by it and that are material to the business of the
Acquired Corporations. To the knowledge of the Company, no such Trade Secret
has been disclosed to or used by any Person except pursuant to a non-
disclosure agreement or other written or otherwise legally enforceable
confidentiality obligation.

(c) Except as set forth in Part 2.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to

educational institution was or is being used, directly or indirectly, to
create, in whole or in part, Intellectual Property Rights owned or purported
to be owned by an Acquired Corporation, except for any such funding or use of
facilities or personnel that does not result in such Governmental Body or
institution obtaining ownership rights to such Intellectual Property Rights.

(d) Part 2.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each (i) license
agreement material to an Acquired Corporation existing as of the date of this
Agreement pursuant to which an Acquired Corporation licenses in any
Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use by such Acquired Corporation
(each an "In-bound License") or licenses out any Intellectual Property Rights
owned by an Acquired Corporation (each an "Out-bound License") (provided,

misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property Rights owned
by an Acquired Corporation. Except as set forth on Part 2.8(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2015, until the date of this Agreement,
no Legal Proceeding has been or is pending and served (or, to the knowledge of
the Company, is being threatened or is pending and has not been served)

directive, order, judgment or other disposition of dispute that adversely
restricts or, to the knowledge of the Company, would adversely restrict the
use, transfer, registration or licensing of any such Intellectual Property
Rights by the Acquired Corporations or otherwise adversely affects or would
adversely affect the validity, scope, use, registrability, or enforceability
of any Intellectual Property Rights owned or purported to be owned by an
Acquired Corporation.

(g) The Company IT Systems operate and perform in a manner that permits the
Acquired Corporations to conduct their respective businesses as currently
conducted in all material respects and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
Person has gained unauthorized access to the Company IT Systems or personal
information, data or other information in a manner that has, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Acquired Corporations take commercially
reasonable actions (including periodic testing and audits), consistent with
current industry standards and guidelines and contractual requirements, to
protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of the Company IT Systems
(and all information and transactions stored or contained therein or
transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use, access, interruption,
modification or corruption, including but not limited to (x) the
implementation of commercially reasonable (i) data backup procedures, (ii)
disaster avoidance and recovery technologies and procedures, (iii) business
continuity procedures and (iv) encryption and other securities protocols, in

Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under applicable Legal

Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Legal
Requirements or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that
any such disclosure or position described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Change Recommendation subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, unless the Company's Board of Directors
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure or in connection
with such action.

(f) The Company agrees that in the event any Acquired Corporation or any
Representative of the Company takes any action which, if taken by the Company,
would constitute a breach of this Section 4.3, the Company shall be deemed to
be in breach of this Section 4.3.

SECTION 5.

|

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 

5.1 Company Board Recommendation.

(a) The Company hereby represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting
duly called and held, has unanimously made the Company Board Recommendation.
Subject to Section 5.1(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. During the Pre-Closing
Period, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal or (C) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Change Recommendation") or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend
or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any Acquired Corporation to
execute or enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval being obtained:

(i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 4.3) from
any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, the Company's Board of Directors shall
have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Offer, (x) the Company's Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into
a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, if and only if: (A)
the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) at least four (4) business
days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
termination (a "Determination Notice") (which notice shall not constitute a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation); and (C) (1) the Company shall have
provided to Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material written materials related
thereto in accordance with Section 4.3(d), (2) the Company shall have given
Parent the four (4) business days after the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the
Company's Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f) would reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen"
communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall
not be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not
require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 5.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 5.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to four (4) business days shall be deemed to be three (3) business
days; and

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company's
Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company's Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company
shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4) business days
prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1)
the Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable
detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) business days
after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance would
no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company's Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would
reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company to the Company's stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
5.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days
shall be deemed to be three (3) business days.

5.2 SEC Filings; Stockholders' Meeting.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Proxy Statement complies in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act. Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates and provide such other assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other proxy or consent
solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement or any other proxy or consent solicitation
statement with respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders received
from the SEC and advise Parent of any material oral comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any other proxy or consent solicitation statement with
respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders received from the SEC. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy Statement or any
other proxy or consent solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of
the Company stockholders or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company shall
cooperate and provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of
such document or response) and consider in good faith any comments provided by
Parent or any of its Representatives with respect thereto.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, respectively, or any of
their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, respectively,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the
Company. Nothing in this Section 5.2(b) shall limit the obligations of any
Party under Section 5.2(a). For purposes of this Section 5.2, any information
concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the Stockholders'
Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any
information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed
to have been provided by Parent.

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement and the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders' Meeting.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the
Stockholders' Meeting and to hold the Stockholders' Meeting as soon as
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement
(or such later date as the Parties shall agree). Except in each case to the
extent that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have made a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation as permitted by Section 5.1, the Company shall,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give
the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.2(c), if, on a date for which the Stockholders' Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Stockholders' Meeting; provided that the Stockholders' Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is in the aggregate more than thirty
(30) days after the date for which the Stockholders' Meeting was originally
scheduled (other than, following consultation with Parent, any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Legal Requirement, including adjournments
or postponements to the extent required under applicable Legal Requirement to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided or made available to the Company stockholders or to permit
dissemination of information which is material to stockholders voting at the
Stockholders' Meeting and to give the Company stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate any such supplement or amendment or other information, provided that,
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, in no event shall the number of days by such
the Stockholders' Meeting is adjourned or postponed exceed thirty (30) days in
the aggregate, less the number of days by which the Stockholders' Meeting has
been adjourned or postponed in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval). Once the Company has established a record date for the
Stockholders' Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Stockholders' Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless, following consultation with Parent,
it is required to do so by applicable Legal Requirement or the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of a proposal to
adjourn the Stockholders' Meeting to solicit additional votes if necessary to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall be the only matters (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Legal Requirement to
be voted on by the Company's stockholders in connection with the adoption of
this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders' Meeting.

5.3 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as
reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,
approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from
Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent,
decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or
termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any Antitrust Law,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or
waivers from third parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

(b) The Parties agree to promptly take, and cause their Affiliates to take,
all advisable actions and steps to cause the prompt expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC
and the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the
Transactions, so as to obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, in no event shall Merger Sub or Parent be required to
offer, accept or agree to, and the Company shall not, without Merger Sub's
prior written consent, offer, accept or agree to (i) divest, license, dispose
of or hold separate any portion of the businesses, operations, assets or
product lines of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or
a combination of the respective businesses, operations, assets or product
lines of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), (ii)
restrict, prohibit or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to conduct its business or own its assets, (iii)
restrain, prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of the business or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in any
part of the world, (iv) cause Parent or any of its Affiliates to divest any
shares of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock or (v) impose limitations on
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates effectively to acquire, hold or
exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation, including the right to vote any shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation acquired or owned by Parent or any of its
Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates be obligated to (x) enter into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Body in
connection with the Transactions or (y) litigate or participate in the
litigation of any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Body challenging or
seeking to restrain, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of the
Transactions or the ownership or operation by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of their
respective businesses as presently conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to) (i)
make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by
the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as practicable and
advisable, but no later than 15 business days of the date hereof, unless a
later date is agreed to in writing by both Parent and the Company, (ii) make
such pre-filings, filings or notifications as may be required or advisable to
be made and seek such consents, approvals or clearances as may be required to
be obtained by such Party under foreign Antitrust Laws in those jurisdictions
identified by Parent on Part 6.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,, as
soon as practicable and advisable, but no later than 30 days of the date
hereof, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by both Parent and the
Company and (iii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and
promptly preparing and making, any other filings or notifications or other
consents required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental
Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.3,
during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall give the other Parties
prompt notice of any communication, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding from or brought by a Governmental Body or from or brought by a
third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the
Transactions (an "Antitrust Investigation"). In connection with any such
Antitrust Investigation, and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information and agreements to limit disclosure to outside counsel
and consultants retained by such counsel and to preserve the attorney-client
or other legal privileges, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such
Antitrust Investigation, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in
connection with any such Antitrust Investigation, (iii) promptly furnish to
the other Party copies of documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Body in connection with any such Antitrust Investigation
(including Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" documents" as those terms are used in the
rules and regulations under the HSR Act, except that such documents need not
be disclosed even to outside counsel or consultants retained by such counsel
to the extent such documents discuss deal negotiations, alternative offers,
valuation, or similar subjects), (iv) to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and consider in good
faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, proposal or
other communication to be made or submitted in connection with any such
Antitrust Investigation and (v) except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such
Antitrust Investigation in respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto
shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the
other Party to be present at each in person meeting relating to any such
Antitrust Investigation. Each Party shall supply as promptly as practicable
and advisable such information, documentation, other material or testimony
that may reasonably be requested by any Governmental Body, including by
complying at the earliest reasonably practicable and advisable date with any
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body
in connection with such applications or filings for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub shall pay all filing fees under the
HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws, but the
Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Merger
Sub and Parent, on behalf of the Parties, shall control and lead all
substantive communications and make in good faith the final determination as
to the appropriate strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws, including whether
to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or
other applicable Antitrust Laws, or pull and refile any filing made under the
HSR Act, provided that the Merger Sub and Parent shall consult and cooperate
with the Company with respect to such substantive communications and strategy,
and consider the Company's views in good faith.

(e) Merger Sub and Parent shall not, before the Closing, authorize or announce
an intention to authorize, or enter into agreements providing for, any
acquisitions of a substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of
the assets of any Person or any business or division thereof that has not
already been publicly announced as of the day before the date of this
Agreement, in each case whether by merger, consolidation, combination,
acquisition of stock or assets or formation of a joint venture or otherwise,
that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions.

5.4 Company Stock Awards; ESPP.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under
the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock
Awards are outstanding or otherwise) (i) so that each such Company Stock Award
shall be converted effective as of the Effective Time in accordance with
Sections 1.8(a), 1.8(b), 1.8(c), 1.8(d) and 1.8(e), (ii) to terminate each
Company Equity Plan (except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder
thereof) effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time, and (iii)
following (and subject to) the conversion described in (i) above, to cause, as
of the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option and each
unexpired Company RSU and Company PSU then outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (and each plan, if any, under which any Company Stock
Award may be granted except, with respect to any such plan, as otherwise
agreed by Parent and a holder thereof) to be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished in consideration of the award of the related Allergan Option,
Allergan RSU, or cash payment, as applicable, as provided in Section 1.8. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to make all filings necessary
in connection with the foregoing actions.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to, contingent on the
Effective Time, (i) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the
offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement,
cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering
period (and purchase period thereunder) then underway under the ESPP to be
determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as
the last day of such offering period and purchase period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP, (ii)
ensure that (x) no new participants may commence to participate in the current
offering period and (y) existing participants may not increase their rate of
contribution with respect to the current offering period and (iii) ensure
that, if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of an offering period that
began after the date of this Agreement, (x) no purchases shall be effected or
permitted with respect to such offering period or purchase period and (y) all
accumulated cash balances of each participant under the ESPP shall be refunded
to such participants. The Company shall terminate the ESPP in its entirety
effective as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the
ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 5.4(b).

5.5 Employee Benefits. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Company who are employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, during their period of active employment by the Surviving
Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period (the
"Continuing Employees") (x) base salary, base wages and severance benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such base salary, base
wages and severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement, and (y) other compensation
(including short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities and commission
opportunities and but excluding equity based compensation) and employee
benefits (other than severance benefits) that are not less materially
favorable in the aggregate than either (at Parent's discretion) (i) those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or
(ii) those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting
the foregoing:

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and, allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company.

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare benefit plans
(to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate
under the Company's health and welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time); provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 5.5 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan or
migrate the Continuing Employees to a successor health or welfare benefit plan
at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any
such health or welfare benefit plan or migrates the Continuing Employees to a
successor health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall
be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare
benefit plans for similarly situated employees to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (each, a "New Plan"). To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any such
New Plan, then Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the commencement of
participation in such New Plan, and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare
benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off),
credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid immediately prior to
the commencement of participation in such New Plan to the same extent that
such service and amounts paid were recognized prior to such commencement of
participation under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the
Company. Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and
the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(c) At the request of Parent made at least five business days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take all steps necessary to terminate the
Company's 401(k) plan and any and all of the Employee Plans that are intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code
(such plans, the "Company 401(k) Plans"), with such termination to be
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and reflected in
the resolutions of the board of directors of the Company (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent). In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plans, Parent shall take any and all actions as may be reasonably required to
permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning Section 401(a)(31) of the Code),
in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to
such Continuing Employee from each Company 401(k) Plan, including notes
evidencing any outstanding loans, from such Company 401(k) Plan to a Parent
plan that is qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the
Code.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make the bonus payments set forth on Part 5.5(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.5 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the
right to enforce the provisions hereof.

5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
and bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and
as provided in the indemnification agreements between the Company and said
Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made
available by the Company to Parent or Parent's Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall be observed by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and
any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such indemnification
rights within such six-year period shall continue to be subject to this
Section 5.6(a) and the indemnification rights provided under this Section
5.6(a) until disposition of such claim.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain in effect, the existing
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of
which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parent's
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on
terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than
the existing policy or (ii) at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the
Company shall (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy effective as of the
Effective Time) and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be
deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant
to this Section 5.6(b); provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with
respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the annual
premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall
be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that

or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; provided, however, that a Party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

nonappealable; provided, however, that a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the issuance of

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a binding written

this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this
Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub shall have occurred, in each

Section 7.1.

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f);

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d); or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), Section

before obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (B) any Person shall have

the Company to the Reverse Termination Fee;

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
7.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 7.3(b)(i), on the

applicable event referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on

amount equal to $74,000,000. In the event that Parent or its designee shall
receive full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(b), the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively,
"Parent Related Parties") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 7.3(b) shall limit the rights of Parent
or Merger Sub under Section 8.5(b).

pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and any payments pursuant to Section 7.3(e) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, "Company Related Parties") for any loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise in the circumstances in which the
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(b), and upon payment of
such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. The Company's right to receive payment from Parent of the
Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(d) and any payments pursuant
to Section 7.3(e) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, in each case in the circumstances
in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(d),
and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) If the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section
7.1(e) or (ii) Section 7.1(c) (to the extent that such restraint arises under
the HSR Act), and in the case of (i) or (ii), all of the conditions under
Section 6 have been satisfied or waived other than (A) the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(a) (to the extent that such restraint arises under the
HSR Act), or Section 6.1(c)(i) and (B) any such conditions which by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date so long as such conditions
would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination of this
Agreement, then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee of
$75,000,000 by wire transfer of same-day funds no later than three Business
Days after such termination (the "Reverse Termination Fee"). In the event that
the Company or its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this
Section 7.3(d), the receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated
hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against Parent or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received and (ii) if Parent
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order
to obtain the payment, the Company commences a Legal Proceeding which results
in a judgment against Parent, Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date

Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

8.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

Section 8.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of

subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.5(a) shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties); and (ii)
each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; provided,
however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party's rights to
seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial
court judgment.

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent

The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent

any person (a "Covered Person") who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative in nature (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such
Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is
or was, at any time during which this Article Eight is in effect (whether or
not such Covered Person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any
indemnification or payment of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the
time any proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director or
officer of the Corporation, or has or had agreed to become a director of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust,
nonprofit entity or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee,
employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered
(including, without limitation, any judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees), actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in connection
with such proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors and administrators; provided however, that, except as
provided in Section (b) of this Article Eight the Corporation shall be
required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the board of directors. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Section (a) of Article Eight and such rights as may be conferred in
the bylaws of the Corporation shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by a Covered
Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
in accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation. The rights conferred upon

such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the indemnitee\'s heirs, executors and administrators. The Corporation may,
by action of the board of directors, provide indemnification to employees and
agents of the Corporation with the same (or lesser) scope and effect as the
foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

In accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, if a claim for
indemnification under this Article Eight is not paid in full within sixty (60)
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the Covered
Person making such claim may at any time thereafter file suit to recover the
unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be
entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.

In accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, the right to indemnification
and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of
its final disposition conferred any Covered Person by this Article Eight (i)
shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise and (ii) cannot be terminated by the
Corporation, the board of directors or the stockholders of the Corporation
with respect to a Covered Person \'s service occurring prior to the date of
such termination.
