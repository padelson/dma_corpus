for which Buyer is

 



      
 

 



 

responsible under this Agreement), that the only Indebtedness of Seller or the

Tribe. Buyer is wholly owned by HoldCo, which, as of the Closing, will be
owned 50% by LDC and 50% by Eagle. The sole general partner of Eagle is Eagle
Holdings GP, LLC, and the sole limited partner of Eagle is the Tribe. Buyer
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as currently
conducted and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary because of the nature of
the business conducted by it, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not (a) reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, properties, financial condition or results of operations
of Buyer or (b) prohibit or delay Buyer from consummating the Transaction.

 



 

 **5.2** **Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability**. Each of Buyer
and LDC has all corporate power or company power, as applicable, and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement (including the Sovereign

specified to be, a party, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by all Parties or parties hereto or thereto other than Buyer and LDC,
this Agreement constitutes, and each Related Document to which it is, or is

the business, operations, properties, financial condition or results of
operations of Buyer or LDC or (y) materially impair the ability of Buyer or
LDC to perform its obligations under this Agreement and each Related Document
to which it is, or is specified to be, a party.

Governmental Approval or consent, approval, license, permit, order,

broker, investment banker or other firm or Person engaged by or acting on

with any of the Transaction.

 



 

 **5.6** **Investment Intent**. Buyer understands that the Equity Interests
may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, without registration
under the Securities Act or a valid exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and that in the absence of an effective registration statement
covering the Equity Interests or a valid exemption from registration under the
Securities Act, the Equity Interests must be held indefinitely. Buyer is
acquiring the Equity Interests for its own account solely for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with,
any distribution thereof. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined under
Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.7** **Financial Ability to Purchase**.

 



 

(a) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, expressly acknowledges and
agrees that its obligations under this Agreement, including its obligation to
consummate the Closing, are not contingent upon its receipt of financing of
any kind and that the only conditions precedent to the Closing are set forth
in _Article VII_. Upon consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby,
Buyer and the Company will not (a) be insolvent or left with unreasonably
small capital, (b) have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay such debts
as they mature, or (c) have liabilities in excess of the reasonable market
value of their assets. Buyer has delivered to Seller duly executed, complete
and accurate copies of certain commitment letters (the " _Commitment Letter_
") with Capital One, National Association or another Affiliate thereof (the "
_Lenders_ "), dated of even date herewith, pursuant to which such Persons have
agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide Buyer with aggregate amounts that, together with the equity
contributions of Eagle and LDC, will be sufficient to timely complete the
Transaction contemplated herein (the " _Financing_ "). There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and, subject to the satisfaction
of such conditions, the Commitment Letter may not be revoked by the Lenders.
There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements, written or oral,
that would permit the Lenders to reduce the amount of Financing set forth in
the Commitment Letter or that could otherwise adversely affect or delay the
availability of the Financing. Subject to the funding of the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms, the aggregate
proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter shall be
sufficient to enable Buyer, along with its own readily available resources
(including the Initial Capital Injection), to pay the Purchase Price for the
Equity Interests and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with respect to the Equity Interests and Company Property.

 



 

(b) LDC has committed to provide, and to cause Eagle to provide, equity
financing in an aggregate amount sufficient to close on the Transaction as
contemplated herein. Immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, LDC
has, and has caused Eagle to, irrevocably contribute equity of $15,000,000 and
$42,000,000, respectively, in cash to Buyer, which Buyer currently holds free
and clear of any and all Liens or other intercompany agreements (the "
_Initial Capital Injection_ "). Eagle and LDC have, and at all times will
have, cash on hand, the right and ability to call capital or the right and
ability to draw cash from its line of credit, in either case in an amount
sufficient to provide the equity financing necessary to timely complete the
Transaction as contemplated herein at Closing.

 



 

 **5.8** **Investigation**. Buyer acknowledges that it is relying on its own
independent investigation and analysis in entering into the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer is knowledgeable about the industries in which the
Company operates, is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and is able to bear the
substantial economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of time.
Buyer has been afforded access to books and records, facilities and personnel
of the Company for purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation, had
the opportunity prior to the date hereof to physically inspect the Company
Property, perform to its satisfaction structural, mechanical, electrical,
plumbing and environmental inspections and tests and review the due diligence
materials on the Company provided to Buyer by Seller in the Data Room.

 



       
 

 



 

 **5.9** **Licensability of Licensing Affiliates; Required Licensees.**

 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.9(a)_ sets forth a correct and complete list of each location
where LDC, its Affiliates (other than Buyer) and/or their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " _Licensed Parties_ ") are licensed by any
Gaming Authority to own or operate gaming facilities. Buyer is a new entity
formed for the purpose of consummating the Transaction and is not, as of the
date hereof, licensed by any Gaming Authority to own or operate gaming
facilities. Each Licensed Party is in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which such Licensed Party owns or operates gaming facilities.
To the Knowledge of Buyer, after discussion with each applicable Gaming
Authority, there is no reason for the Gaming Authorities not to grant all
required Gaming Approvals or refuse to grant any finding of suitability with
respect to Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ , to the Knowledge of Buyer,
there are no facts, that if known to the Gaming Authorities, would (i)
reasonably be expected to result in the denial, revocation, limitation or
suspension of a Gaming Approval with respect to Buyer, any of its principals,
Representatives or Affiliates, or any of its or their respective officers,
directors, key employees or Persons performing management functions similar to
an officer (such Persons, the " _Licensing Affiliates_ "), (ii) reasonably be
expected to result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability
proceedings currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary
to obtain a Gaming Approval required to consummate the Transaction or (iii)
reasonably be expected to negatively impact, or cause a delay under, any
suitability proceeding required by a Gaming Authority to consummate the
Transaction.

 



 

(c) _Schedule 5.9(c)_ sets forth each Licensing Affiliate that Buyer believes
must obtain a Gaming Approval in order to consummate the Transaction
(together, the " _Required Licensees_ ").

 



 

(d) To the Knowledge of Buyer, none of the Required Licensees has ever been
arrested, detained, charged, indicted or convicted or pleaded guilty or nolo
contendere or forfeited bail in connection with any criminal offense under the
Laws of any jurisdiction, whether such criminal offense constitutes a felony
or misdemeanor (except for traffic violations, the maximum possible punishment
for which was a fine not in excess of five hundred dollars ($500)).

 



 

 **5.10** **Compliance with Gaming Laws**. Other than routine matters in
connection with updating of Licensing Affiliates disclosure obligations and
matters in connection with obtaining Gaming Approvals, neither Buyer, its
Affiliates, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any Licensing Affiliate has
received notice of any pending investigation or review by any Gaming Authority
or other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over any gaming operations of
Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to Buyer, its Affiliates, any of the
Licensing Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, key
employees or Persons performing management functions similar to an officer
and, other than routine matters in connection with updating of Licensing
Affiliates disclosure obligations and matters in connection with obtaining
Gaming Approvals, to the Knowledge of Buyer, (a) no investigation or review is
threatened, (b) no Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over any gaming operations of Buyer or its Affiliates has
indicated any intention to conduct the same, and (c) there are no facts that,
if

 



      
 

 



 

known to a Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over any gaming operations of Buyer or its Affiliates, will or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any inquiry or investigation, or to
result in the revocation, limitation or suspension of a license issued to such
Persons by an applicable Governmental Entity. Other than routine matters in
connection with updating of Licensing Affiliates disclosure obligations and
matters in connection with obtaining Gaming Approvals, neither Buyer, any of
its Affiliates, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any Licensed Party or
director, officer, key employee or partner of a Licensed Party has suffered a
suspension or revocation of any license issued to such Persons by an
applicable Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over any gaming operations of Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



 

 **5.11** **Tribal Matters.**

 



 

(a) _Federally Recognized Tribe_. The Tribe is a federally recognized Indian
tribe organized under 25 U.S.C. §476, Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization
Act most recently pursuant to a Certificate of Constitutional Amendment
Approval issued by U.S. Department of Interior, Assistant Secretary-Indian

or documentation that such Person may reasonably request in connection with
obtaining the foregoing consents, orders, authorizations and approvals;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such efforts shall not require

credit support or guarantee or otherwise remain secondarily or contingently
liable to obtain any such permit or consent, (y) to pay any monies or provide
any other financial accommodation in connection therewith that is not already

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate from the
landlord of the Leased Company Property, dated within thirty (30) days of the
Closing Date, in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer and

litigation or other Proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties

condition in this Agreement and shall not in any way affect any rights or
obligations of any of the Parties under this Agreement, and (z) neither Seller

Affiliates arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
estoppel certificate; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the immediately

submissions, with respect to this Agreement, as required under any applicable
antitrust laws, including the HSR Act, to obtain the Governmental Approvals,
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental

require Seller or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates (x) to provide any credit support or guarantee or otherwise remain
secondarily or contingently liable to obtain any such permit or consent, (y)
to pay any monies or provide any other financial accommodation in connection

Governmental Approvals, including filing such additional applications,
supplemental information and documents as may be required or requested by a
Governmental Entity, and shall reasonably cooperate with each other in

cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to schedule and attend any hearings or meetings with Governmental
Entities to obtain the Governmental Approvals as promptly as possible. Buyer,
Seller and their respective Affiliates shall have the right to review in

information relating to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives that appear in any filing made with,

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer,
Seller and their respective Affiliates will notify the other Party promptly of
the receipt of comments or requests from Governmental Entities relating to
Governmental Approvals, and will supply the other Party with copies of all
correspondence between the notifying Party or any of its Representatives and
Governmental Entities with respect to Governmental Approvals, subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including antitrust

Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly advise
each other upon receiving (i) any communication from any Governmental Entity
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to reasonably believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that such consent or approval from such
Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed or (ii) any communication from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person (x) challenging or seeking damages in
connection with the Closing or any other transaction governed by this
Agreement or (y) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the

regulations promulgated thereunder with the Antitrust Authorities and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) notifications, filings, registrations and other materials required or
necessary under any other applicable antitrust laws, and will respond as

date set by the Gaming Authorities or any other applicable Governmental
Entity, whichever is earlier, all required initial applications and documents
required to be filed in connection with obtaining the Governmental Approvals,
including, (i) with respect to each of the Regulated Persons, a correct and
complete application for licensure or suitability that complies with
applicable Gaming Laws and (ii) for each Buyer financing source and its
Affiliates and any related individual qualifiers that require approvals under
applicable Gaming Laws. If Buyer or its Affiliates determine or are otherwise
made aware that any other Person must obtain Gaming Approval in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of
being made so aware) Buyer shall provide notice thereof to Seller and as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days)
or by any date set by the Gaming Authorities, whichever is earlier, Buyer
shall cause such Person to file with the Gaming Authorities a correct and
complete application for licensure or suitability that complies with
applicable Gaming Laws. Buyer and LDC shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to promptly comply (and cause
each such Person making an application to comply) with any request of the
Gaming Authorities related to any such applications and to obtain approval of
the Gaming Authorities for all such applications as promptly as reasonably
practicable so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Buyer and LDC
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, keep Seller informed on
a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of all such
applications. The Parties acknowledge that Seller intends to file or cause to
be filed this Agreement for approval by, and that this Agreement is subject to
the approval of, the Gaming Authorities.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.5(a)_, Buyer, LDC and their
respective Affiliates agree to take promptly any and all steps and actions
reasonably necessary to avoid or eliminate each impediment that may be

Gaming Laws) so as to enable the Closing to occur expeditiously, and in no
case later than the Outside Date, including, as applicable, (i) providing
information to such Persons, and (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to,
or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise: (A) the
sale, divestiture, winding down or disposition of, or holding separate

Buyers Affiliates (other than the Tribe itself) assets, properties,
operations and businesses, or of the assets, properties, operations and
Business of the Company; (B) the termination, modification, or extension of
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Buyer,
Buyers Affiliates (other than the Tribe itself) or the Company with respect
to relationships that involve the ordinary course provision of goods and
services; and (C) the disassociation from any officer,

 



       
 

 



 

director, employee and/or member of Buyer, LDC, Eagle or any of their
respective Affiliates (except no member will be required to disassociate from
the Tribe itself); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to _clause (A)_
above, in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates be required to (1) sell,
divest, wind down or dispose of any of the casino properties listed on
_Schedule 6.5(d)_ , (2) take any action that would result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (3) take any action that would result in a
material adverse effect on LDC, the Tribe, Buyer and the Company, taken as a
whole, assuming for this purpose that Buyer has acquired the Equity Interests,
or (4) take any illegal action. In addition, Buyer and LDC shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, oppose, through and including
Proceedings on the merits (and any appeals with respect thereto), any claim
asserted in any court or other forum by any Person in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain or prevent the
Closing by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 6.5_ shall require, or be construed to require, LDC or any of its
Affiliates to agree to take any action that would violate LDCs federal
charter or otherwise cause LDC to lose its status as a federally charted
corporation pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 477.

 



 

(e) This Agreement is subject to the Gaming Laws and the Liquor Laws. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that all rights, remedies and
powers under this Agreement, including ownership and operation of the gaming
facilities, and the possession or control of gaming equipment, alcoholic
beverages or a gaming or liquor license, may be exercised only to the extent
that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provisions of the
Gaming Laws and Liquor Laws and only to the extent that required approvals
(including prior approvals) are obtained from the requisite Governmental
Entities. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the sale, assignment,
transfer, pledge or other disposition of the Equity Interests is ineffective
unless approved in advance by the Gaming Authorities, and that the Gaming Laws
and regulations restrict the right under certain circumstances: (a) to pay or
receive any dividend or interest upon such security; (b) to exercise, directly
or through any trustee or nominee, any voting right conferred by such
security; or (c) to receive any remuneration in any form from the Company, for
services rendered or otherwise.

 



 

 **6.6** **No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals**. Subject to obligations
imposed by Law, prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , Seller and the Company shall
not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, through
any of their Representatives (i) provide to any Person any confidential
information concerning the Company, the Business or the Company Property in
furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) solicit or initiate or facilitate
any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any Contract with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) engage in negotiations with any Person (or group
of Persons) other than Buyer or its respective Affiliates in furtherance of an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit or restrict any
action by Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to any
Parent Matter (including furnishing any information in furtherance of,
entering into and participating in discussions or negotiations with respect
to, recommending, otherwise seeking to facilitate or implement, or entering
into a definitive agreement providing for or consummating, a transaction
relating to any Parent Matter) and any such actions shall not in and of
themselves whatsoever constitute a breach of this Agreement. As used herein, "
_Parent Matter_ " means (i) any issuance or sale of debt or equity securities
of Seller

 



      
 

 



 

or its Affiliates (other than the Company), (ii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving Seller
or its Affiliates other than directly involving the Company ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such Parent Matter shall not relieve Seller or its
Affiliates of their respective obligations under this Agreement), or (iii) any
sale, exchange or other disposition of any asset or property of Seller or its
Affiliates other than any such transaction with an unaffiliated third party
directly involving the Company, the Company Property, the Equity Interests or
any assets of the Company.

 



 

 **6.7** **Expenses; Transfer Taxes.**

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Related
Documents and the Transaction shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expense, it being understood and agreed that Buyer shall be solely responsible
for any filing fees under the HSR Act.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Seller shall equally bear the cost of all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer Taxes, real property transfer gains Taxes and
any filing and recording fees) and related amounts (including any penalties,
interest and additions to Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Related Documents and the Transaction (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Tax
Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be timely prepared by the Party
legally obligated to make such filing. The Parties shall cooperate to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any available exemptions from any
such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any
information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for and, to the extent paid by Seller or one of
its Affiliates, reimburse Seller at Closing for the costs of all (i) title
insurance (including any lender policies) incurred in connection with this
Transaction, including any searches, examinations and related charges incurred
in connection therewith, (ii) current surveys relating to the Owned Real
Property or Leased Company Property and (iii) current Phase I reports for the
Owned Real Property and Leased Company Property, including, if applicable, any
update to such Phase I reports pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)(ii)_.

 



 

 **6.8** **Publicity**. Each of Seller, Buyer and LDC shall agree on the form
and content of any press release regarding the Transaction and thereafter
until the Closing Date shall consult with each other before issuing, provide
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon and use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon, any press release or other public statement
with respect to any of the Transaction. Seller, LDC, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and prior to considering in good
faith any such comments, except as may be required by Law (including the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any Gaming Laws) or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system, it being understood and agreed that
Seller intends to file Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, Seller or its respective Affiliates may make
any

 



      
 

 



 

public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Buyer (or LDC) and Seller and do not reveal non-public information relating
to the other Party.

 



 

 **6.9** **Disclosures**. Each disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall qualify this Agreement. Descriptions
of terms or documents summarized in the Schedules shall be qualified in their
entirety by the documents themselves. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, Seller may disclose to Buyer in writing (in the form of updated
disclosure Schedules) any development, fact or circumstance arising after the
date hereof causing a breach of any of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article IV_ and of any breach of the covenants in this Agreement
made by Seller or the Company. Any updated disclosure Schedules shall amend
and supplement the appropriate disclosure Schedules delivered on the date
hereof and attached hereto; provided that, such disclosures shall not be
deemed to amend and supplement the appropriate disclosure Schedules for
purposes of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ or Buyers
ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_. Upon the
Closing, the delivery of any such updated disclosure Schedules will be deemed
to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant that
otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such inaccuracy or breach
and Buyer shall not have any claim (whether for indemnification or otherwise)
against Seller or any of its Affiliates for any such breach or inaccuracy.

 



 

 **6.10** **Employee Matters.**

 



 

(a) As of the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) shall continue to employ all of those individuals who
are immediately prior to the Closing Date employed by the Company (such
individuals, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect with
respect to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) For a period of sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement
(unless Seller otherwise agrees in writing to extend such period) (such
period, as may be so extended, the " _Consultation Period_ "), Buyer may (i)
interview at a reasonable time arranged through Sellers Vice President of
Finance and Strategy (and any individuals as may be designated in writing by
Seller) and (ii) at Buyers election, make offers of employment, to those
employees of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company) who are listed
on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ (the " _Offered Employees_ "), which offers of
employment, if any, shall comply with the terms and conditions of _Section
6.10(a)_ as if the Offered Employees were Continuing Employees. Any Offered
Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment during the Consultation
Period shall be deemed to be a Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date for
purposes of this _Section 6.10_. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the actual
severance costs and expenses (excluding any Stay Bonuses), if any, incurred by
Seller under any written employment agreement, severance plan or other
arrangement providing for termination benefits with respect to any Offered
Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment. From and after the
Consultation Period until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
earlier of the date of any termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, the Company) shall, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for
employment (or other provision of services), either as an employee,
consultant, agent or representative, any Offered Employee who does not accept
an offer of employment from Buyer during the Consultation Period (irrespective
of whether Buyer makes an offer of employment to such Offered Employee).

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (but in any event no later
than two weeks following the Closing Date), Seller shall pay the amount
indicated on _Schedule A_ , if any, payable pursuant to those certain
retention letter agreements identified on _Schedule A_ as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and any payroll and employment
Taxes applicable thereto) (each, a " _Stay Bonus_ " and, collectively, the "
_Stay Bonuses_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the liability for and
obligation to pay any remaining unpaid portion of the Stay Bonuses (and any
payroll and employment Taxes applicable thereto) shall be the responsibility
of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company)
following the Closing and any portion of the Stay Bonuses payable by Buyer and
its Affiliates shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the
arrangements evidencing the applicable Stay Bonus and applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Closing, all Continuing Employees shall cease to
participate in all Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(e) To the extent applicable with respect to employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements that are established or maintained by Buyer for the benefit
of Continuing Employees, Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
shall be given credit for their service with the Company and its Affiliates
(including Seller) (i) for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and, for purposes of vacation and severance (but no other purpose), benefit
accrual to the extent such service was taken into account under a
corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be credited in accordance with this _Section 6.10(e)_ to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this _Section
6.10_ and for the avoidance of doubt:

 



 

(i) If the Closing Date occurs after the last day of the Sellers fiscal year
ended April 23, 2017, Buyer shall cause the Company to assume liability for,
and to pay to each Continuing Employee who is employed by the Company as and
when due, the annual bonus to which the Continuing Employee is entitled under
Sellers annual performance bonus plan (the " _Annual Bonus Arrangement_ ")
for such fiscal year (to the extent not paid as of the Closing Date);
_provided_ , that an accrued liability in respect of such amounts is included
on the Final Closing Statement.

 



 

(ii) For the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall cause
the Company to pay to each Continuing Employee who is employed by the Company
an annual bonus which is no less than the annual bonus that such Continuing
Employee would have received under the Annual Bonus Arrangement for such
fiscal year

 



      
 

 



 

had the Closing Date not occurred; _provided_ , that an accrued liability in
respect of amounts accrued through the Closing Date is included on the Final
Closing Statement.

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall cause the Company to provide severance payments and benefits
to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date which are no less favorable than the severance
benefits that would have been paid to such Continuing Employee under Sellers
written severance plan as in effect on the Closing Date for a termination
under comparable circumstances, a copy of which plan is set forth on _Schedule
6.10(f)(iii)_.

 



 

(g) Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and
against any loss, damage, liability, claim, cost or expense (including
reasonable attorneys fees) that may be incurred by, or asserted against,
Seller arising out of or relating to Buyers failure, if any, to comply with
the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any similar state
Laws with respect to the Continuing Employees.

 



 

(h) Except for those Continuing Employees who are employed by Buyer or its
Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ , Buyer agrees that for a period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the date which is eighteen (18)
months after the earlier of the date of any termination of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, it shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to),
directly or indirectly, solicit or hire for employment or in any other
capacity any individual who is currently, or at any time becomes, employed by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company subsequent to the
Closing), until such individual has been separated from such employment for at
least forty-five (45) days (and subject to the restrictions in _Section
6.10(b)_ ), unless Seller provides Buyer specific prior written consent. For
the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.10(h)_ shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Nothing in this _Section 6.10_ , whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any Person who is not a Party to this Agreement, including any Continuing
Employee, any right to employment or recall, any right to continued
employment, any right to compensation or benefits, or any other right of any
kind or nature whatsoever and nothing contained herein shall be treated as an
amendment of any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

 **6.11** **Termination of Affiliate Contracts**. Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand, and the
Company and its Affiliates, on the other hand, to terminate the Affiliate
Contracts effective as of the Effective Time (the " _Termination of Affiliate
Contracts_ "); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
any Affiliate Contracts that are enterprise-level Contracts maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company), Seller shall terminate only
the Companys rights and obligations with respect to such Contracts. The
Termination of Affiliate Contracts shall be without liability or loss to the
Company.

 



 

 **6.12** **Reservations; Chips; Front Money.**

 



 

(a) _Reservations_. Buyer will honor the terms and rates of all reservations
(in accordance with their terms) made prior to the Closing at the Company
Property by guests or customers, including advance reservation Cash deposits,
for rooms or services confirmed by

 



      
 

 



 

Seller or the Company for dates on or after the Closing Date in the ordinary
course of business of the Business located at the Company Property. Buyer
recognizes that such reservations may include discounts or other benefits,
including benefits extended under the Isle of Capri Fan Club Card or any other
frequent player or casino awards programs, group discounts, other discounts or
requirements that food, beverage or other benefits be delivered by Buyer to
the guest(s) holding such reservations; _provided_ , that all such discounts
or other benefits shall be provided in the ordinary course of business of
operating and supporting the Business located at the Company Property. Buyer
will honor all room allocation agreements and banquet facility and service
agreements which have been granted to groups, persons or other customers that
(i) have been entered into as of the date hereof, or (ii) are entered into in
the ordinary course of business of operating and supporting the Business
located at the Company Property, at the rates and terms provided in such
agreements.

 



 

(b) _Redemption and Destruction of Chips and Tokens_. From the Effective Time
until a date that is no later than the expiration date of the Transitional IP
License, the Company may continue to use the Sellers Chips that were in use
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, if required by the applicable
Gaming Laws, submit a plan to the relevant Gaming Authorities at least thirty
(30) days prior to the expiration date of the Transitional IP License, or such
earlier date required by the Gaming Authorities, for the redemption and
destruction of all Sellers Chips used by the Company that bear any Isle
Trademarks. After such plan is approved by the relevant Gaming Authorities (or
not later than the expiration date of the Transitional IP License, if no such
approval is necessary), Buyer shall redeem for Cash all of the Sellers Chips
that bear any Isle Trademarks issued by the Company at the Company Property
for a period of not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days. Following the
expiration date of the Transitional IP License, except in connection with the
redemption and destruction of the Sellers Chips described in such plan, Buyer
shall cease to issue or use (and Buyer shall not reissue or reuse) any
Sellers Chips of the Company or Seller. After the Closing, Buyer shall be
solely responsible and liable for compliance with applicable Gaming Laws and
regulations of Gaming Authorities with respect to operation and support of the
Business subsequent to Closing, including any obligation to redeem and destroy
Sellers Chips; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
any of Sellers Chips redeemed by Buyer or the Company that was not set forth
on the list described in _Section 3.4(a)_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Front Money_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Representatives of each
of Buyer and Seller shall take inventory of all Front Money and identify what
Persons are entitled to what portions of such Front Money. All such Front
Money shall be retained in the cages of the Company Property and listed in an
inventory prepared and signed jointly by Representatives of Buyer and Seller
no later than the Effective Time and included in the calculation of Working
Capital. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall distribute Front Money
only to the Persons and only in the amounts as determined pursuant to this
_Section 6.12(c)_.

 



 

 **6.13** **Release of Guarantees.**

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller, Buyer and LDC shall cooperate and shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, effective as of the
Closing, on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller, (i) terminate or
cause to be terminated, or, if required

 



      
 

 



 

for the continued operation of the Company post-Closing in the ordinary
course, cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects
for Seller and any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) (each, a "
_Released Party_ " and collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") in respect of
all liabilities of the Released Parties under, each guarantee, deposit or
letter of credit of or relating to liabilities (including under any Material
Contract, Contract, Company Lease or other lease of Leased Real Property) of
the Company, including those set forth on _Schedule 6.13(a)(i)_ ("
_Guarantees_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall remain solely
responsible for any amounts payable to the extent related to the period prior
to the Closing under any Guarantee, and (ii) cause Buyer or one of its
Affiliates to have surety bonds (and any necessary collateral, indemnity or
other agreements associated therewith), or other security acceptable to the
applicable obligee, issued on behalf of Buyer or one of its Affiliates in
replacement of all surety bonds (and all collateral, indemnity and other
agreements associated therewith) issued on behalf of the Released Parties for
the benefit of the Company that are required for the continued operation of
the Company in the ordinary course, including those set forth on _Schedule
6.13(a)(ii)_ (the " _Surety Bonds_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall remain solely responsible for any amounts payable to the extent related
to the period prior to the Closing under any Surety Bond that was not so
replaced. In the case of the failure to do so by the Closing, then, following
Closing, Seller, Buyer and the Company (which will then be owned by Buyer)
shall continue to cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts as described in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to the
Guarantees under the Company Lease, prior to the Closing, (1) Buyer, LDC or
one of their respective Affiliates shall post a certificate of deposit, cash
deposit or other cash collateral in replacement of any existing certificate of
deposit, cash deposit or other cash collateral previously posted by Seller, in
amounts and on terms required by the landlord under the Landlord Consent and
(2) LDC shall provide a guarantee of the Companys obligations under the
Company Lease in replacement of any existing guarantee previously provided by
Seller on the terms required under the Landlord Consent. From and after the
Closing, Buyer and the Company (which will then be owned by Buyer) shall (x)
indemnify the Released Parties for any and all liabilities and losses arising
from any Guarantees (other than the Guarantees under the Company Lease, which
will be handled in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) and
Surety Bonds to the extent related to the period from and after the Closing
and (y) not permit the Company or its Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the
term of, (B) amend or waive any provision of, (C) increase its obligations
under, or (D) transfer to another third party any Material Contract, Contract,
letter of credit, Company Lease or other lease of Leased Real Property or
other liability for which any Released Party is or would be liable under such
Guarantee (other than the Guarantees under the Company Lease, which will be
handled in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) or Surety Bond;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of _clause (D)_ , Buyer shall not be
prevented from making any such transfer in connection with the direct or
indirect sale of the Company or all of the Companys assets to an unaffiliated
third party, provided that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Buyer
of its obligations under this _Section 6.13(a)_. To the extent that any
Released Party has performance obligations under any such Guarantee or Surety
Bond related to the period from and after the Closing, Buyer, the Company
(which will then be owned by Buyer) and, solely with respect to the Guarantees
under the Company Lease, LDC, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to (I) fully perform or cause to be fully performed such obligations on behalf
of such Released Party or (II) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by Seller so as to place such Released Party in the same position as
if Buyer, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company (which will then be owned by Buyer) or LDC (solely with respect to the
Guarantees under the Company Lease), and not such Released Party, had
performed or was performing such obligations.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller, Buyer and LDC shall cooperate and shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, effective as of the
Closing, on terms reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer, (i) terminate or
cause to be terminated, or cause Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than
the Company) to be substituted in all respects for the Company in respect of
all liabilities of the Company under, each guarantee, deposit or letter of
credit of or relating to liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company), including those set forth on _Schedule 6.13(b)(i)_ ("
_Company Guarantees_ "), and (ii) cause Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than the Company) to have surety bonds (and any necessary collateral,
indemnity or other agreements associated therewith) issued on behalf of Seller
or one of its Affiliates (other than the Company) in replacement of all surety
bonds (and all collateral, indemnity and other agreements associated
therewith) issued on behalf of the Company for the benefit of Seller or one of
its Affiliates (other than the Company), including those set forth on
_Schedule 6.13(b)(ii)_ (the " _Company Surety Bonds_ ").

 



 

 **6.14** **Pre-Closing Claims**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to, and shall be
entitled to cause the Company to, at Sellers own cost, risk and expense, (a)
control the defense and investigation of any Pre-Closing Claim, (b) employ and
engage attorneys of its own choice to handle and defend any Pre-Closing Claim
and (c) compromise, settle or otherwise discharge any Pre-Closing Claim, in
each case before and after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
applicable settlement agreement shall not contain an admission of liability by
the Company and must include a confidentiality provision reasonably
satisfactory to both Seller and Buyer. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company to, at no cost to Buyer or the Company, reasonably
cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives in connection
with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have no
authority to bind the Company to alter its operations post-Closing.

 



 

 **6.15** **Slot Club**. Buyer (a) acknowledges that, prior to the date
hereof, Seller has provided to Buyer all information reasonably requested by
Buyer relating to Sellers accounting methodologies used to determine the
Companys liability with respect to Sellers slot club program reflected on
the Balance Sheets, (b) agrees that such liabilities with respect to Sellers
slot club program reflected on the Balance Sheets are calculated in accordance
with such methodologies provided by Seller and (c) agrees not to take any
position or make any claim after the date hereof that any such liability was
not properly determined in accordance with such methodologies.

 



 

 **6.16** **Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) Buyer and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer, director, manager or member
of the Company, as provided in the certificate or articles of incorporation,
articles of organization, by-laws or operating agreement of the Company, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall not be terminated
or

 



      
 

 



 

modified in a manner as to adversely affect any director, officer, manager or
member to whom such provisions apply, and shall survive the Closing Date and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
for a period of not less than six (6) years.

 



 

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section 6.16_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any

being expressly agreed that the directors, officers, managers or members to
whom this _Section 6.16_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this

activities.

and applicable Law, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not directly or
indirectly control, supervise, direct or interfere with, or attempt to
control, supervise, direct or interfere with, the business operated at the

the Company) to, upon request by and at the expense of Seller or its

any business (other than the Business) as currently conducted by Seller or its
Affiliates in the Territory; and (D) shall not directly or indirectly restrict
or otherwise prevent Seller or its Affiliates from acquiring, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, by purchase of stock or assets,
merger or otherwise, the whole or any part of a Person that carries on all or
a portion of a Restricted Business or the whole or any part of a business that
includes the carrying on of all or a portion of a Restricted Business (each, a
" _Potential Acquired Business_ ") if no more than fifteen percent (15%) of
the Potential Acquired Business (determined by reference to the most recent
annual revenue of such Potential Acquired Business at the time of the
acquisition and after such acquisition, the annual revenue each year after the
acquisition during such eighteen (18) month non-compete period) comprises a
Restricted Business; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller and its
Affiliates may acquire, directly or indirectly, a Potential Acquired Business
even if it does not fall below the foregoing fifteen percent (15%) threshold
if the Seller or such Affiliate sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of
(including by terminating or winding down the operations comprising the
Restricted Business or diverting those operations to a business other than a
Restricted Business) sufficient assets so that the annual revenue of such
Potential Acquired Business attributable to the Restricted Business falls
below such fifteen percent (15%) threshold (determined on a pro forma basis as
if the sale, transfer or other disposition of such assets had

 



      
 

 



 

occurred as of the first day of the most recently completed fiscal year of
such Potential Acquired Business) within twelve (12) months after such
acquisition.

 



 

(b) Commencing on the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, Directly Market to any Exclusive Players for
purposes of diverting their business from the Company Property to any Other
Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller
or its Affiliates from Directly Marketing to any customer who, after the
Closing Date, has gambled or wagered at or otherwise visited any Other
Property. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Directly Market_ " means any
marketing to such players by U.S. Mail, email, telephone or social media
(including via Twitter or Facebook) that contains special promotions that are
offered solely to Exclusive Players or other mass marketing (including via
newspaper, television or radio) that contains special promotions offered
solely to Exclusive Players. Not later than twenty (20) Business Days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall delete from the Customer Database all of the
Exclusive Players, including all Personal Identifying Information regarding
such Exclusive Players; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may maintain a
copy of any such data deleted from the Customer Database pursuant to this
_Section 6.20(b)_ to the extent required to comply with applicable Law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall not be required to delete
electronic copies of such data which reside only in backups or archives that
are not generally accessible by persons other than Sellers information
technology and legal or compliance personnel, or which are retrievable only
using forensic computer recovery techniques.

 



 

(c) For a period of eighteen (18) months commencing on the Closing Date,
Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the
Company or encourage any such employee to leave such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation, job board posting, social media and the
like which is not directed specifically to any such employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.20(c)_ shall
not apply with respect to any employee of the Company who has been terminated
by the Company, or has left the employment of the Company absent breach of
this _Section 6.20(c)_ by Seller (including Sellers controlled Affiliates)
and has not been an employee of the Company for at least three (3) months.

 



 

(d) Seller acknowledges that a breach of this _Section 6.20_ may give rise to
irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages may not be an adequate
remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach by Seller of any such
obligations, Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other equitable relief that may be available from
a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(e) The terms and provisions of this _Section 6.20_ shall survive the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.20_
shall, directly or indirectly, restrict or otherwise bind any Person or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Seller entity and its controlled Affiliates as
of the date hereof) who (i) currently holds or in the future acquires debt
securities of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, regardless of the form of the
transaction, (ii) currently owns or in the future acquires equity securities
of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, whether in a merger, consolidation,
stock purchase, reorganization or other transaction

 



      
 

 



 

regardless of form, or (iii) acquires all or a portion of the business or
assets of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, whether in an asset purchase,
reorganization or other transaction regardless of form, but only to the extent
of such assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller or any of its
controlled Affiliates sells a Subsidiary of Seller (whether in a sale of the
equity interests or all or substantially all of the assets of the Subsidiary)
and such Subsidiary accounts for more than fifty percent (50%) of Sellers
revenue (determined by reference to the most recent annual revenue of the
applicable entities), the terms and provisions of this _Section 6.20_ shall
apply to such Subsidiary entity (in a sale of the equity interests) or to the
assets of such Subsidiary (in a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets), but only to the extent of such assets; _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the acquirer of such Subsidiary of Seller or all or
substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary of Seller shall not, nor
shall its Affiliates, be bound by this _Section 6.20_ with respect to any of
their assets or businesses other than such newly acquired Subsidiary
continuing to be bound by this _Section 6.20_ (in a sale of the equity
interests) or the acquired assets of such Subsidiary (in a sale of all or
substantially all of the assets), as applicable. In the event Seller sells all
or substantially all of the assets of Seller, the acquirer thereof would not
have the right to commercially use any information on any copy of the
Exclusive Players list that is maintained by Seller in accordance with the
restrictions in _Section 6.20(b)_.

 



 

(f) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.20_
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this _Section 6.20_ should ever be adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
then any such court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law. The covenants contained in this _Section 6.20_ and each provision hereof
are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

 **6.21** **Financing**.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause HoldCo to, use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to keep in place, enforce and consummate
the Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, and each of Buyer, HoldCo and LDC shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing, if
necessary to consummate the Transaction, whether debt, equity or otherwise. In
the event all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, each of
Buyer, HoldCo and LDC shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange for alternative financing. Each of Buyer and
HoldCo shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreements related to the Financing if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

adversely affect or delay the consummation of the Financing or the Closing.
In the event of any amendment, supplement or modification of, or waiver of any
rights under, the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing, each of Buyer and HoldCo shall provide a copy thereof to Seller
promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days, and references in
this Agreement to the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to refer to any
such Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented or modified. Neither Buyer
nor HoldCo, nor any of their respective Affiliates on their behalf, shall
agree to or permit any termination of the Financing. In the event alternative
financing is obtained, references in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall
be deemed to include such alternative financing. Each of Buyer and LDC shall
keep Seller informed as to all material developments affecting any Financing
or alternative financing.

 



 

(b) From and after the date hereof, Buyer shall hold the Initial Capital
Injection funds free and clear of any and all Liens or intercompany agreements
and shall not declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or
intercompany indebtedness until the earlier of: (i) if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with the provisions of _Article VIII_ , the date of
the final resolution of any and all disputes or Proceedings by or between the
Parties arising under or related to this Agreement (including the termination
thereof), and (ii) the Closing of the Transaction, at which time the remaining
Initial Capital Injection funds will be released to Seller as part of the
payment of the Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller and Buyer
hereby acknowledge and agree that Buyer may use a portion of the Initial
Capital Injection funds to pay (x) the Deposit and (y) other reasonable and
customary out-of-pocket transaction expenses incurred by Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection with the Transaction (including investment banking
fees, legal and accounting fees and the Financing commitment fees) in an
amount not to exceed $2,500,000 (except with the prior written consent of
Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) Subject to the rights of the parties to the agreements governing the
Financing under the terms of such agreements, none of the Parties, nor or any
of their respective Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as
parties to this Agreement or any document related to this Agreement, shall
have any rights or claims against any Lender, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders, credit providers, agents, trustees, representatives or
arrangers in connection with the Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Subject to the rights of the parties to the
agreements governing a LDC Financing under the terms of such agreements, none
of the Parties, nor or any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement or any document related to
this Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any LDC Financing
Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders, credit providers,
agents, trustees, representatives or arrangers in connection with any LDC
Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.21(c)_ shall not limit in any manner any remedy
of the Seller Indemnified Parties against Buyer, LDC or any of their
respective successors or assigns (whether by merger, combination or other
reorganization) under this Agreement, including any remedy against Buyer, LDC
or any of their respective successors or assigns (whether by merger,
combination or other reorganization) for breach of any arrangements related to
the Financing, the Commitment Letter, any LDC Financing or any of the
agreements entered into in connection with the foregoing or any of the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, but subject in all cases to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.22** **Risk of Loss Relating to Real Property**. If there shall occur
any material damage or destruction of any Owned Real Property or Leased
Company Property (collectively, the " _Subject Real Property_ "), including
damage or destruction resulting from weather such as natural disasters, faulty
construction, fire or flood, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer thereof and,
to the extent known, of the scope and estimated amount of such damage or
destruction.

 



 

(a) _Minor Loss_. Buyer shall be bound to consummate the Transaction as
required by the terms hereof with respect to the Company, without regard to
the occurrence or effect of any such material damage or destruction of any of
such Subject Real Property; _provided_ , that: (i) the cost to repair any
such damage or destruction to the Subject Real Property is less than or equal
to $10,000,000 (a " _Minor Loss_ ") in the estimate of an architect or
contractor mutually and reasonably agreeable to Buyer and Seller; and (ii)
Buyer shall have the option (A) for a period of twenty (20) days after receipt
of Sellers notice of the occurrence of a Minor Loss, upon written notice to
Seller, to delay the Closing until such time as Seller has repaired the damage
to such Subject Real Property to the condition that existed immediately prior
to such damage or destruction, reasonable wear and tear excepted, but in no
event shall such delay exceed a period of forty-five (45) days after the
occurrence of a Minor Loss notwithstanding the failure to complete such
repairs by such time, after which time Buyer shall be obligated to close the
Transaction on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement or
(B) to close the Transaction on the terms and subject to the condition of this
Agreement notwithstanding the failure to complete such repair of such Subject
Real Property, whereupon Seller shall pay Buyer at the Closing, from any
insurance proceeds or otherwise should adequate insurance proceeds not then be
available, the remaining cost to repair the damage to the condition that
existed immediately prior to such damage or destruction, reasonable wear and
tear excepted. Sellers notice of the occurrence of a Minor Loss shall be
deemed to amend and supplement the appropriate disclosure Schedules and cure
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant that otherwise might
have existed hereunder by reason of such Minor Loss for purposes of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ or remedies under
_Article IX_ , subject to Sellers obligation to pay Buyer the amounts under
this _Section 6.22(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Major Loss_. If the cost to repair the material damage or destruction to
any Subject Real Property exceeds $10,000,000 (a " _Major Loss_ ") in the
estimate of an architect or contractor mutually and reasonably agreeable to
Buyer and Seller, then Buyer or Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to
terminate this Agreement, such election to be effective only if exercised (i)
by Buyer in writing within forty-five (45) days after Buyers receipt of
Sellers notice of the occurrence of such damage or destruction or (ii) by
Seller in writing within forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of such
damage or destruction. If either Buyer or Seller elects to terminate this
Agreement by delivering written notice thereof as provided in this _Section
6.22(b)_ , then this Agreement shall terminate in accordance with _Article
VIII_ and the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer. If neither Party gives
timely written notice of termination of this Agreement within the time period
required herein, then this Agreement shall not terminate and Seller shall
promptly commence the repair of the damage to such Subject Real Property to
the condition that existed immediately prior to such damage or destruction,
reasonable wear and tear excepted, and at the Closing, if Seller shall not
have returned such Subject Real Property to

 



      
 

 



 

the condition that existed immediately prior to such damage or destruction,
reasonable wear and tear excepted, there shall be a credit against the Closing
Payment hereunder equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds collected by
Seller as a result of any such damage or destruction (but not business
interruption insurance proceeds), plus the amount of any insurance deductible,
self-insured retention or similar amount with respect to any damaged or
destroyed Subject Real Property, less any sums expended by Seller or the
Company toward the restoration or repair of such Subject Real Property. If
such proceeds have not been collected as of the Closing Date and the Subject
Real Property has not been returned to the condition that existed immediately
prior to such damage or destruction, reasonable wear and tear excepted, then
there shall be a credit against the Closing Payment due hereunder equal to the
amount of the insurance deductible, self-insured retention or similar amount
with respect to such damaged or destroyed Subject Real Property, and such
proceeds (but not business interruption insurance proceeds) shall be assigned
to Buyer (and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer after the Closing
to collect such proceeds), except to the extent needed to reimburse Seller for
sums expended to repair or restore the damaged or destroyed Subject Real
Property, and Seller shall retain the rights to such proceeds to such extent.
Sellers notice of the occurrence of a Major Loss shall be deemed to amend and
supplement the appropriate disclosure Schedules and cure any misrepresentation
or breach of warranty or covenant that otherwise might have existed hereunder
by reason of such Major Loss for purposes of the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ or remedies under _Article IX_ , subject to Sellers
obligation to pay Buyer the amounts under this _Section 6.22(b)_ and the
termination rights under this _Section 6.22(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Condemnation_. In the event all or any material portion of any Subject
Real Property is taken by eminent domain or becomes subject to a taking by
eminent domain or a deed in lieu of condemnation prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of the same (the " _Eminent
Domain Notice_ "), and each of Seller and Buyer, at its option to be exercised
in writing within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer of the Eminent Domain
Notice, may either, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement or
proceed with the Closing as set forth herein and in such case, Buyer shall
accept title to all of such Subject Real Property subject to such taking or
proceeding, together with an assignment of all of Sellers rights and interest
in and to any proceeds or compensation in connection with such taking or
proceeding other than as provided herein and a credit against the Closing
Payment for any amounts previously paid to Seller as condemnation proceeds or
compensation in connection therewith, other than as provided herein, less the
amount of the aggregate proceeds reasonably required to compensate Seller for
the loss of revenue for the pre-Closing period related to such eminent domain
or taking (but only to the extent Seller has not recovered or may not recover
such amounts pursuant to business interruption insurance, which Seller must
either pursue in good faith or assign to Buyer) which portion of the proceeds
shall be retained by Seller or paid over to Seller, as applicable. If Seller
or Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement by delivering a timely written
notice thereof to the other Party within such 10-day period, then this
Agreement shall terminate in accordance with _Article VIII_ and the Deposit
shall be returned to Buyer; and otherwise Buyer shall be deemed to have
elected to proceed with the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Sellers Eminent Domain Notice shall be deemed to
amend and supplement the appropriate disclosure Schedules and cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant that otherwise might have
existed hereunder by reason of such matter disclosed in the Eminent Domain
Notice for purposes of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ or
remedies under _Article IX_ , subject to Sellers obligation to

 



      
 

 



 

pay Buyer the amounts under this _Section 6.22(c)_ and the termination rights
under this _Section 6.22(c)_.

 



 

 **6.23** **Notices**. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date, Seller shall promptly after receipt by Seller, the Company or
Sellers Affiliates (or, with respect to _clause (h)_ below, promptly after
delivery by Seller, the Company or Sellers Affiliates), provide to Buyer

Environmental Law by Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any Owned Real

respect to the Company Property.

 



 

 **6.24** **Property Repairs**. From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, undertake the Property Repairs in
the ordinary course of business of the Company. In the event Seller undertakes
the Property Repairs, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller shall have
the right to hire contractors, subcontractors and other service providers to
evaluate and perform the Property Repairs. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) in no event shall Sellers failure to perform or complete the
Property Repairs be considered a breach of any term, covenant or condition in
this Agreement and shall not in any way affect any rights or obligations of
any of the Parties under this Agreement, other than the calculation of the
amount of the Repair Credit, and (b) neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall
have any liability

 



      
 

 



 

whatsoever to Buyer or its Affiliates arising out of or relating to the
failure to perform or complete the Property Repairs, other than the amount of
the Repair Credit.

case of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ , _7.2(c)_ , _7.3(c)_ or
_7.3(d)_ ), by written notice given to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, for up
to an additional forty-five (45) days (the " _Initial Extension Period_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Closing of the Transaction shall not have
been consummated by the end of the Initial Extension Period solely for the
failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth under _Sections
7.1(a)_ , _7.2(c)_ , _7.3(c)_ or _7.3(d)_ and the satisfaction of such
conditions remains reasonably possible, the Outside Date may be further
extended by Seller by written notice given to Buyer, for up to an additional
forty-five (45) days after the Initial Extension Period; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (i) Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ if Seller or the Company has failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this
Agreement and such failure or breach has been the primary cause of, or
materially contributed to, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Outside Date or the Initial Extension Period (if applicable) and (ii)
Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ if Buyer or its Affiliates has failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement and such
failure or breach has been the primary cause of, or materially contributed to,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date or the
Initial Extension Period (if applicable);

 



 

(c) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, (i) if Buyer shall at any time,
directly or indirectly, withdraw its or its Affiliates application for any
Gaming Approval, or (ii) if any Gaming Authority shall have made a
determination, including issuing any legal constraint or prohibition, that a
Gaming Authority will not issue all Closing Gaming Approvals on or prior to
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ of this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be
available to Seller if Sellers failure (or Sellers Affiliates failure) to
fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause
of, or materially contributed to, a Gaming Authority making such determination
not to issue a Closing Gaming Approval;

 



 

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, by written notice to the other Party, if the
non-terminating Party shall have breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ (if a breach by Seller) or _Section 7.3(a)_ or _(b)_ (if a
breach by Buyer), and such breach, if of a type that can be cured, shall not
have been cured by the non-terminating Party or waived by the terminating
Party within twenty (20) days after notice thereof from the terminating Party
or, if earlier, by the date immediately preceding the Outside Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such
twenty (20) day period but can be reasonably cured prior to the Outside Date,
and the non-terminating Party is diligently proceeding to cure such breach,
this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ ;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to the terminating Party if the
terminating Party shall have materially breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, which material breach was the primary
cause of, or materially contributed to, the breach of the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the non-terminating Party for
which this Agreement may have been terminated under this _Section 8.1(d)_ ;

 



 

(e) by either Buyer or Seller, by written notice to the other Party, if a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity (other than any
Gaming Authority) shall have issued a permanent injunction, cease and desist
order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, injunction,
restraint or prohibition shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure (or whose
Affiliates failure) to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the primary cause of, or materially contributed to, such order, injunction,
restraint or prohibition; or

 



 

(f) by either Buyer or Seller, by written notice to the other Party, as
provided in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section 6.22(b)_ or
_6.22(c)_.

 



 

 **8.2** **Effect of Termination**. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided in _Section 8.1_ , all further obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement will terminate, except that the provisions of _Sections 6.3_
(Confidentiality), _6.7(a)_ (Expenses), _6.8_ (Publicity), _Section 6.10(h)_
(Non-solicitation of Seller Employees), _Section 6.21(b)_ (Financing), this
_Article VIII_ (Termination) and _Article XII_ (General Provisions) will
survive. Nothing in this _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed to
release any Party from any liability for any actual fraud in the making of the
representations and warranties hereunder or willful misconduct by such Party
with respect to such Partys obligations under this Agreement. The phrase
"willful misconduct" shall be interpreted throughout this Agreement to mean
that the Party who engaged in "willful misconduct" acted purposely with the
conscious object of breaching the terms or provisions of this Agreement or
otherwise causing the failure of a condition to such Partys obligation to
close the Transaction to occur; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if Buyer and
LDC have complied with their respective obligations under _Section 6.21(a)_
(Financing), and the lenders nonetheless fail to fund the debt financing
component of the Financing, such failure by Buyer to obtain the proceeds of
such debt financing from the lenders necessary to pay the Purchase Price and
the failure to effectuate the Closing as a result thereof shall not be
"willful misconduct", and (b) if Buyer and LDC have complied with their
respective obligations under _Section 6.5_ (Regulatory Matters and
Cooperation), and any Governmental Entity and/or Gaming Authority nonetheless
fails to provide the required Governmental Approvals or Closing Gaming
Approvals necessary to consummate the Transaction, such failure by Buyer and
LDC to obtain the Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Approvals and/or Closing Gaming Approvals necessary to effectuate the Closing
as a result thereof shall not be "willful misconduct".

 



 

 **8.3** **Application of the Deposit.**

 



 

(a) In the event the Parties terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Sections
8.1(a)_ , or _8.1(f)_ , then Seller shall promptly, and in any event within
three (3) Business Days, pay to Buyer as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy,
the Deposit, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, which the Parties
acknowledge and agree is reasonable under the circumstances.

 



 

(b) In the event that Buyer validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ , _8.1(d)_ , or _8.1(e)_ , and, at the time of such
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ , _8.1(d)_ or _8.1(e)_ , (i) Seller
shall not also be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of
_Section 8.1(b)_ , _8.1(d)_ , and _8.1(e)_ and (ii) the conditions in
_Sections 7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_ are each satisfied (except, with respect to a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , the satisfaction of the condition
in _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be required), then Seller shall promptly, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days, pay to Buyer, as Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy, the Deposit, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
which the Parties acknowledge and agree is reasonable under the circumstances.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall more than one payment of the
Deposit be made to Buyer under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Upon any termination of this Agreement not expressly provided in _Section
8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ , the Deposit shall be retained by Seller free and clear
of any adverse right or claim. Prior to the Closing, entitlement to the
Deposit pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall in no way limit, diminish, or
waive any right of Seller or its Affiliates to recover additional damages from
or exercise any other remedies at law or in equity against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to actual fraud or any willful misconduct by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 8.3_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall in any way limit, diminish or waive the right of a Party to pursue
specific performance remedies; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller
terminates this Agreement, Sellers rights and remedies shall be limited to
retaining the Deposit, absent actual fraud or willful misconduct by Buyer or
its Affiliates.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

 **9.1** **Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements**. The representations and warranties made by Seller, Buyer and LDC
in this Agreement shall generally survive the Closing until (and claims based
upon or arising out of such representations and warranties may be asserted at
any time before) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.4_ ,
_4.11_ , _4.13_ , _4.20_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.5_ , _5.6_ , _5.8_ , _5.11_ ,
_12.19(a)_ and _12.19(b)(iii)_ (collectively, the " _Fundamental
Representations_ "), such Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing until (and claims based upon or arising out of such representations
and warranties may be asserted at any time before) the statute of limitations
with respect to such matters or, if no statute of limitations is

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, indefinitely. Any covenants and agreements in this Agreement that
by their terms are to be performed only during the pre-Closing period,
including _Section 6.1_ , shall terminate at the Closing, and all other
covenants and agreements of the Parties and LDC in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing without any contractual limitation on the period of
survival (except to the extent, if any, that a period is otherwise expressly
set forth in such covenant or agreement or herein in connection with the
applicable covenant or agreement). The period of time a representation or
warranty or covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this
_Section 9.1_ shall be the applicable " _Survival Period_ " with respect to
such representation or warranty or covenant. The obligation to indemnify
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ shall terminate upon expiration of the applicable
Survival Period, unless an Indemnified Party shall have made a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period. The termination of the applicable Survival Period
for the representations and warranties or a covenant and agreement provided
herein shall not affect a Partys indemnification claim if such Party has made
such claim in reasonable detail in writing and such written claim is received
by the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival
Period. No claim may be brought based upon, directly or indirectly, any of
the representations and warranties or a covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement after the applicable Survival Period with respect to such
representation or warranty or covenant or agreement.

 



 

 **9.2** **Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (each, a " _Buyer
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all costs, liabilities, demands and expenses (whether
or not arising out of Third-Party Claims), including interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys fees and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or
settlement of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Damages_ "), incurred by
any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or the Company
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Seller at
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, as of the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as
of the Closing Date (or in each case such earlier date provided in such
representation or warranty);

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement made, or to be
performed, by Seller or its Affiliates on or after Closing, or by the Company,
prior to or at the Closing, in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any Pre-Closing Claims; or

 



 

(iv) any Excluded Indebtedness.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (each, a " _Seller
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all Damages incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
to the extent resulting from:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or LDC in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer or LDC at
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, as of the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as
of the Closing Date (or in each case such earlier date provided in such
representation or warranty);

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement made, or to be
performed, by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Company)
in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the ownership, use, operation or maintenance of the Company or the
Company Property, including the operation and support of the business located
at the Company Property (including the Business), for matters arising after
the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, LDC shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages incurred by
any Seller Indemnified Party to the extent resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by LDC in _Article V_
(including the representations and warranties in _Section 5.11_ and otherwise
to the extent LDC is specifically identified in _Article V_ ), _Section 12.19_
, or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of LDC at the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was
made or as if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the
Closing Date (or in each case such earlier date provided in such
representation or warranty); or

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement made, or to be
performed, by LDC in this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.3** **Interpretation.**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as used in
this _Article IX_ , the term Damages shall not include any consequential,
incidental, indirect, punitive or special damages, claims for lost profits or
lost business opportunities, diminution in value, multiple of profits or other
valuation methodology, or any similar damages, except to the extent actually
awarded to a Governmental Entity or other third party.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article IX_ for any Damages (i) to the extent arising as a result of any
action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) to
the extent arising from a change in Law, accounting policies, or
interpretations thereof after the date hereof, (iii) to the extent taken into
account in calculating the Closing Payment pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , (iv)
to the extent repaired, paid for or otherwise remedied or addressed pursuant
to _Section 6.22_ , or (v) if such Damage is accrued, provided or reserved for
in, or otherwise taken into account in connection with, the Working Capital
adjustment pursuant to _Article III_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.4** **Procedure for Claims between Parties**. If a claim for Damages is
to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ , such party shall give
written notice briefly describing the claim in reasonable detail and the total
monetary Damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the
" _Indemnifying Parties_ ") as soon as practicable after such Indemnified
Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which may give rise to
Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this _Article IX_. Any
failure to submit any such Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
any Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

 **9.5** **Defense of Third-Party Claims**. If any lawsuit or enforcement
action is filed against an Indemnified Party by any third Person (each, a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ may
be sought, Notice thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly
as practicable. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice
hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (if it so elects) at its own cost,
risk and expense, (a) to take control of the defense and investigation of such
Third-Party Claim, (b) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (
_provided_ that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the named parties to such
Proceeding include both one or more Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party
that are different from or additional to those available to an applicable
Indemnifying Party such that a conflict of interest exists that would make
separate representation appropriate under applicable principles and canons of
legal representation, in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
at the Indemnifying Partys reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate
counsel ( _provided_ that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party), and (c) to compromise or settle such claim, which
compromise or settlement shall be made only (i) with the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) or (ii) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party
and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third-Party
Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall provide the Indemnifying
Party all reasonably requested documents, including a power of attorney;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action
and any appeal arising therefrom. The Parties shall cooperate with each other
in any notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
the defense of such claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice,
the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted will have the
right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Partys reasonable cost, risk and
expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such claim shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense
of the claim, the Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of
any such defense, compromise or settlement.

 



 

 **9.6** **Limitations on Indemnity.**

 



 

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party shall seek, or be
entitled to, indemnification under _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _(a)(ii)_ ,
_9.2(b)(i)_ or _(b)(ii)_ or _9.2(c)(i)_ unless (i) the aggregate amount of
Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, with respect to any individual claim exceeds $35,000 (the "
_Minimum Amount_ "), and (ii) the aggregate amount of the individual claims
for Damages (each of which is greater than the Minimum Amount) of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, for which
indemnification is sought (x) exceeds $500,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") and (y)
is less than an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the aggregate amount of all individual claims for Damages
(each of which is greater than the Minimum Amount) for which indemnification
is sought pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _(a)(ii)_ , _9.2(b)(i)_ or
_(b)(ii)_ or _9.2(c)(i)_ , as applicable, equals or exceeds the Threshold,
then Buyer or Seller, as applicable, subject to the limitations in this
_Article IX_ , shall be entitled to recover only such Damages (each of which
is greater than the Minimum Amount) that are in excess of the Threshold once
the Threshold has been met, but in any event not to exceed the Cap (it being
agreed that except as provided below, in no event shall the aggregate
indemnification to be paid under _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _(a)(ii)_ ,
_9.2(b)(i)_ or _(b)(ii)_ or _9.2(c)(i)_ exceed an amount equal to the Cap).
The limitations contained in this _Section 9.6(a)_ shall not apply to
Fundamental Representations, representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.7(h)_ (to the extent they become operative pursuant to the terms
thereof) or claims pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(iii)_ , _9.2(a)(iv)_ or
_10.1(a)_.

 



 

(b) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the amount
of the Damages (i) shall not be duplicative of any other Damage for which an
indemnification claim has been made and (ii) shall be computed net of (A) any
amounts actually recovered or recoverable by such Indemnified Party under any
insurance policy, title policy, or other right to recovery from a third party
or otherwise with respect to such Damages (net of any costs and expenses
incurred in obtaining such recovery) and (B) any Tax benefit realized or to be
realized by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the
facts or circumstances giving rise to such Damages. If an Indemnifying Party
pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in
respect of such claim are collected by the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Party promptly shall remit the insurance proceeds (net of any
costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds) to
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds
in respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Parties seek indemnification
under this _Article IX_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages that the Indemnified Party asserts
or that it could reasonably be expected to assert under this _Article IX_.
Furthermore, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no right to make a claim
for any Damages to the extent such Damage is primarily a possible or potential
Damage that the Buyer Indemnified Parties believe may be asserted rather than
a Damage that has, in fact, been paid or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Parties. Attorney, consultant, and other professional fees and disbursements
incurred by an Indemnifying Party in connection with this _Article IX_ shall
be reasonable.

 



 

(c) To the extent that an Indemnifying Party pays on an indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ , and the Indemnified Party has a claim against a
third party (other than the Indemnifying Party), then the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to the claim of the Indemnified Party to the extent of the
amount of indemnification paid by the Indemnifying Party and to the extent
such payments are duplicative of amounts due to the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) In no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party
be entitled to recover twice for the same Damages.

 



 

(e) Any claim of indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ for Damages in
respect of Taxes shall be limited to such Damages incurred with respect to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(f) In no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Party seek, or be entitled to,
indemnification under this _Article IX_ for Damages in an amount exceeding the
Purchase Price.

 



 

 **9.7** **Payment of Damages**. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in Cash by
an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party may become
entitled by reason of the provisions of this _Article IX_ , within fifteen
(15) days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the
Parties or on the date on which both such amount and an Indemnified Partys
obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final judgment of a
court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Proceeding.

 



 

 **9.8** **Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ and _Section 10.1(a)_ and all
payments made pursuant to _Section 3.5(h)_ shall be treated by the Parties for
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

 **9.9** **Exclusive Remedy**. Except to the extent of claims alleging fraud
in the making of the representations and warranties hereunder, and except
pursuant to the terms of _Section 3.5_ , after the Closing, the indemnities
provided in _Section 6.13_ , _Section 9.2_ or _Article X_ shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of,
resulting from or incurred in connection with any claims regarding matters
arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a Party from
bringing an action after the Closing for specific performance or other
equitable remedy to require a Party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby to be entered
into by the Parties. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, LDC and Seller
each hereby waive (and, by their acceptance of the benefits under this
Agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller Indemnified Party hereby
waives), from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, actual fraud
in the making of the representations and warranties hereunder and claims
arising under _Section 3.5_ ) such Party may have against any other Party, any
Lender or any LDC Financing Source arising under or based upon this Agreement
or any schedule, exhibit, Schedule, document or certificate delivered in
connection

 



      
 

 



 

herewith, and no legal action under any Laws, including Environmental Laws or
otherwise, sounding in tort, statute or strict liability may be maintained by
any Party (other than a legal action brought solely to enforce the provisions
of this _Article IX_ , _Article X_ , _Section 3.5_ or the provisions of any
other agreement executed pursuant to this Agreement) and, following the
consummation of the Transaction, in no event shall any Party be entitled to
any remedy of rescission of the Transaction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **10.1** **Tax Returns; and Certain Other Tax Matters**. The following
provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and
Seller for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) Seller will include the income of the Company on Sellers consolidated
federal income Tax Returns (and, to the extent applicable, state Tax Returns)
for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal income Taxes
attributable to such income. Not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer and hold Buyer and the Company harmless from and against: (i)
all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and the Seller for all
Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_
") and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Straddle Period
as determined under _Section 10.1(d)_ ; and (ii) any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or
successor by contract or pursuant to any Law, rule or regulation, including
pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations or any analogous or
similar state, local or non-U.S. Law or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above, Seller shall be liable
only to the extent that such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any,
reserved, for such Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the face of the
Final Closing Statement (rather than any notes thereto). Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for any Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant
to this _Section 10.1(a)_ within fifteen (15) Business Days after payment of
such Taxes by Buyer of the Company.

 



 

(b) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
timely be filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Subject to Sellers
review and written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in
accordance with past practice of the Company (or Seller, as applicable) and
timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company for any taxable year or period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ ") and shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.
Buyer shall file or cause to be filed when due all other Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company after the Closing Date
and shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall cause or permit the
Company to) (i) amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of
any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return, (ii) file any Tax
Return in a jurisdiction where the Company has not historically filed Tax
Returns, (iii) initiate discussions or examinations with any Governmental
Entity regarding Taxes, or make any voluntary disclosures with respect to
Taxes relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or (iv) change any accounting method or
adopt any convention that shifts taxable income from a period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or shifts deductions or losses
from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after
the Closing Date, in each case, without the prior written consent of Seller or
(v) make any election to carryback any post-acquisition Tax attribute of the
Company into a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period.

 



 

(d) For purposes of _Section 10.1_, in the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes
of the Company allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use taxes), or
employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains
or receipts (including sales and use taxes), or employment or payroll Taxes,
be deemed equal to the amount allocable to such portion of the Straddle Period
based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior
practice of the Company.

 



 

(e) Any Tax sharing agreement between Seller and the Company is terminated as
of the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable year
(whether the current year, a future year, or a past year).

 



 

 **10.2** **Tax Indemnification Procedures; Contest Provisions.**

 



 

(a) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing upon receipt
by such Party or any of their respective Affiliates of notice of any pending
or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations,
claims or assessments (a " _Tax Claim_ ") for which such Party is entitled to
seek, or is seeking or intends to seek, indemnification pursuant to _Article
IX_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Sections 9.4_ and _9.5_ , Seller shall have the sole
right, in good faith, to control and to represent the interests of the Company
in and with respect to any Tax Claim or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and to employ counsel of its
own choice for such purpose. Seller shall have the sole right to

 



      
 

 



 

settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. In
the case of any Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to participate at
its expense in or with respect to any Tax Claim or administrative or court
proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date and, with Buyers
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) and at
Sellers sole expense, may assume the entire control of such audit or
proceeding. From and after the Closing, none of Buyer, the Company or any of
its respective Affiliates shall settle or compromise, or agree to settle or
compromise, any Tax Claim related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

 **10.3** **Tax Refunds.**

 



 

(a) Any Tax refund or credit that is received by Buyer or the Company, and any
amount credited against Tax to which Buyer or the Company becomes entitled,
that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of the Straddle
Period ending at the end of the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of
any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to pay over to
Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit against Tax up to the
amount of any Tax asset (excluding any deferred Tax asset established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face
of the Final Closing Statement (rather than any notes thereto) with respect to
such refund or credit.

 



 

(b) Any amount of Taxes that was reflected on the Final Closing Statement that
was not in fact paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be for the
account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such amount within
fifteen (15) days after the determination of Taxes to which such amount
relates.

 



 

 **10.4** **Purchase Price Allocation**. The Parties acknowledge that the
acquisition of the Company is intended to be treated as a taxable asset
acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes and agree that the Purchase
Price and other amounts treated as consideration for Tax purposes will be
allocated to the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date Seller shall
provide to Buyer a schedule allocating the purchase consideration to the
assets of the Company (the " _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ "). Seller
shall consider in good faith any comments timely provided by Buyer with
respect to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. The Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding on the Parties, and Buyer and
Seller shall report and file Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and shall not take any
position (whether in proceedings, audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such Purchase Price Allocation Schedule unless required to
do so by Law. Any adjustment to the purchase consideration shall be allocated
as provided by Treasury Regulation section 1.1060-1(c).

 



 

 **10.5** **Tax Records**. For a period of seven (7) years after Closing, upon
reasonable written notice, Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
Seller, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (to the
extent within the control of such Party) relating to the business of the
Company (including access to books and records) for any Pre-Closing Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Periods or Straddle Periods as is reasonably requested for the filing of all
Tax Returns, and making of an election related to Taxes, the preparation for
any audit by any Governmental Entity, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding related to any Tax Return. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other similar
proceeding relating to Taxes involving the business conducted by the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods. Buyer shall retain the
books and records of the Company delivered to Buyer in accordance with this
provision for a period of seven (7) years after Closing.

 



 

 **10.6** **Tax Benefits**. Seller shall be entitled to any Tax benefit
arising from the payment of any Transaction Expense and Buyer agrees that any
such Tax benefit shall be allocated to the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period
or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

 



 

 **RISK OF LOSS**

 



 

 **11.1** **As Is, Where Is**. Buyer or its Representatives to the extent it
so desires shall have examined and inspected the Company Property prior to the
execution of this Agreement, and subject to the provisions of this _Article
XI_ and otherwise in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to accept the Company
Property in an "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition as of the Closing. Buyer agrees
that, except as provided in _Article IV_, Buyer is not relying upon any
representations, statements, or warranties (oral or written, implied or
express) of any officer, employee, agent or Representative of Seller, or any
salesperson or broker (if any) involved in this transaction as to the Company
Property, including: (a) any representation, statements or warranties as to
the physical condition of the Company Property; (b) the fitness and/or
suitability of the Company Property for use as a resort, hotel, casino and/or
any other use or purpose; (c) the financial performance of, or any projections
related to, the Company or their casinos or hotels; (d) the compliance of the
Company Property with applicable building, zoning, subdivision, environmental,
land use laws, codes, ordinances, rules or regulations or any other Laws; (e)
the state of repair or condition of the Company Property; (f) the value of the
Company Property; (g) the manner or quality of construction of the Company
Property; (h) the income derived or to be derived from the Company or their
casinos or hotels; or (i) the fact that the Company Property may now be
located in hurricane zones, on earthquake faults or in seismic hazardous
zones. Seller makes no representations or warranties as to merchantability or
fitness for any particular purpose and no implied representations or
warranties and disclaims all such representations and warranties. Without
limiting the foregoing, and except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_,
Seller and its Affiliates disclaim any warranty of title or noninfringement
and any warranty arising by industry custom or course of dealing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives has made
any representation or warranty with respect to, and Buyer is not relying on,
any management presentation, confidential information memoranda, business
plans, data site materials, projections, forecasts or forward-looking
statements made by or made available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives. Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge that,
in entering into this Agreement, they have relied solely on their own
investigation of the Company Property and the Company and on the
representations and

 



      
 

 



 

warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_, subject to the limitations
and restrictions specified herein. Subject to this _Section 11.1_ and
compliance by Seller and the Company with their respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein prior to the Closing,
Buyer, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives any right to assert
any claim against Seller or its Affiliates at law or in equity, relating to
any matter described in _clauses (a)_ through _(i)_ of this _Section 11.1_,
or otherwise disclaimed in this _Section 11.1_, whether latent or patent,
disclosed or undisclosed, known or unknown, in contract or tort, now existing
or hereafter arising.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII**

 



 

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **12.1** **Assignment**. This Agreement and all the rights and powers granted
hereby shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
heirs, successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement and the rights,
interests and obligations hereunder may not be assigned or otherwise
transferred (including by transfer by operation of law other than the laws of
inheritance, merger, stock or asset purchase, restructuring, reorganization or
other change of control transaction) by any Party, without the prior written
consent of both Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may (a)
assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to an
Affiliate (other than the Tribe or an Affiliate of the Tribe possessing
sovereign immunity) with written notice to, but without the written consent
of, any other Party or (b) make a collateral assignment to its lender of its
rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement with written notice to,
but without the written consent of, any other Party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in all cases, no permitted assignment or transfer shall relieve the
assigning Party of its obligations or agreements hereunder or require the
other Parties to resort to any such assignee or transferee prior to seeking
any remedies against the assigning or transferring Party permitted under or
pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation
of this _Section 12.1_ shall be null and void.

 



 

 **12.2** **No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. Except as set forth in the final
sentence of this _Section 12.2_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their permitted assigns and as provided in _Section 6.6_, and
nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the Parties and such assigns and as provided in _Section
6.6_, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Lenders and LDC Financing Sources
shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of _Section
6.21(c)_, _Section 9.9_, this _Section 12.2_, _Section 12.7_, _Section
12.11_ and _Section 12.20_.

 **12.4** **Headings**. The headings contained in this Agreement, in any
Exhibit or Schedule hereto and in the table of contents to this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.5** **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or electronic means including
.pdf form), each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

 



 

 **12.6** **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, the Related Documents, and the
Confidentiality Agreement (and all exhibits and schedules to this Agreement
and thereto) constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, relating to such subject
matter. Neither Party shall be liable or bound to any other Party in any

subject matter except as specifically set forth herein.

 



      
 

 



 

 **12.7** **Amendments; Extensions and Waivers**. This Agreement may not be
amended except by a writing signed by Buyer and Seller. Each of the Parties
may, to the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for or waive the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other Parties, (b)

_Section 12.2_, this _Section 12.7_, _Section 12.11_ and _Section 12.20_
shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to

LDC Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the LDC Financing
Sources.

 



 

 **12.8** **Severability**. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that
the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

 



 

 **12.9** **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard
to the conflicts of law principles of such State.

 



 

 **12.10** **Consent to Jurisdiction**. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (a)
CONSENTS TO SUBMIT ITSELF TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF (i) ANY
FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND (ii) ANY DELAWARE STATE
COURT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE THAT ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS, (b) AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY OR DEFEAT
SUCH PERSONAL JURISDICTION BY MOTION OR OTHER REQUEST FOR LEAVE FROM ANY SUCH
COURT AND (c) AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN ANY COURT
OTHER THAN A FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR A DELAWARE
STATE COURT UNLESS VENUE WOULD NOT BE PROPER UNDER RULES APPLICABLE IN SUCH
COURTS.

 



 

 **12.11** **Waiver of Jury Trial**. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT

 



      
 

 



 

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENT (INCLUDING THE COMMITMENT
LETTER) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (c) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

 **12.12** **Mutual Drafting**. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement of document.

 



 

 **12.13** **Other Properties**. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that in
addition to owning and operating the Company Property, Seller and/or
Affiliates of Seller operate certain other hotel and casino properties and own
certain other assets that are not located at, and not used exclusively for the
operation of the business located at, the Company Property. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Parties agree that: (i) Seller is
not making any representations or warranties with respect to any such
properties or assets; (ii) Seller is not assigning or transferring to Buyer
any right, title or interest in, to or under any such assets or properties;
and (iii) none of such assets or properties shall be subject to any
restrictions by virtue of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.14** **Time of Essence**. Time is of the essence with respect to this
Agreement and all terms, provisions, covenants and conditions herein.

 



 

 **12.15** **Specific Performance**. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of Buyer or Seller to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to Seller or Buyer, respectively, for which damages, even
if available, may not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief (without requirement to post any
bond or other security) by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel
performance of each Partys obligations and to the granting by any court of
the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder and the terms
hereof, including the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Buyer and
LDC set forth in _6.21_ (Financing) of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties agree that Buyer or Seller may seek to compel specific
performance by Seller or Buyer, respectively, for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if all of the conditions under _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2_ (other than those conditions that may only be satisfied on the Closing
Date; _provided_ that such conditions are capable of being satisfied) have
been satisfied on or prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Outside Date, or have been waived in whole or in part by Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, prior to the Outside Date, and Buyer fails to effect
the Closing in breach of its obligations hereunder, then (a) Seller shall have
been caused irreparable harm, (b) money damages will be inadequate to remedy
such harm, and (c) Seller shall be entitled, without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, to obtain equitable relief, including
obtaining an order requiring specific performance by Buyer of the terms of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
all of the conditions under _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ (other than
those conditions that may only be satisfied on the Closing Date; _provided_
that such conditions are capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied on or
prior to the Outside Date, or have been waived in whole or in part by Seller
or Buyer, as applicable, prior to the Outside Date, and Seller fails to effect
the Closing in breach of its obligations hereunder, then (x) Buyer shall have
been caused irreparable harm, (y) money damages will be inadequate to remedy
such harm, and (z) Buyer shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting
a bond or other security, to obtain equitable relief, including obtaining an
order requiring specific performance by Seller of the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.16** **Attorneys  Fees**. In the event of litigation relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement, the non-prevailing Party shall reimburse the
prevailing party for all reasonable attorneys fees and costs of such Party
resulting therefrom.

 



 

 **12.17** **Conflicts and Privilege**. Buyer, Seller, LDC and the Company
agree that notwithstanding any current or prior representation of Seller
and/or its Affiliates by Mayer Brown LLP (" _MB_ "), MB will be allowed to
represent Seller or any of its Affiliates (which will no longer include the
Company after the Closing) in any matters and disputes, including in any
matter or dispute adverse to Buyer, LDC and their respective Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company) that either is existing on the
date hereof or that arises in the future and in each case relates to this
Agreement, and each of Buyer and LDC does hereby, and agrees with respect
thereto to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company)
to, (a) waive any claim they have or may have that MB has a conflict of
interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation, and
(b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
Buyer and LDC or any of their respective Affiliates (on the one hand) and
Seller or any of its Affiliates (on the other hand), MB may represent Seller
or such Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or such
Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer, LDC or their respective Affiliates
(including the Company) and even though MB may be handling ongoing matters for
Buyer or the Company. Each of Buyer and LDC further agrees, and agrees to
cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that MB shall be permitted to represent the Company pursuant to
the terms of _Section 12.17_ of this Agreement) to agree, that, as to all
privileged communications between or among MB and Seller and any of its
Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Company) that relate in any
way to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company,
its Affiliates or any of its respective operations for the period ending at
the Closing, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to, and may be controlled by, Seller and will not pass to
or be claimed by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company). Accordingly, none of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) will have access to such communications from and after
the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 12.17_, if a
dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, LDC or their respective
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) and a third party other
than a Party to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (or its Affiliates), the Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by MB to such
unaffiliated third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. This
_Section 12.17_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 12.17_ may
be amended, waived, or modified, without the prior written consent of Seller
and Buyer.

 



 

 **12.18** **Buyer Guarantee**. LDC hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees (except for any conditions contained in this _Section 12.18_) the
payment and performance when due of all obligations, liabilities and
indebtedness of any kind, nature and description of Buyer and its Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with a Third-Party Claim as contemplated
hereby (collectively, the " _Third-Party Obligations_ "). The Third-Party
Obligations may be enforced by Seller against LDC without any requirement that
Seller first exercise its rights against Buyer. In determining when payment,
performance or discharge of obligations by LDC are due, and the amount
thereof, LDC may assert any defenses or limitations to any such payment,
performance or discharge, and any rights, remedies, counterclaims, reductions
and setoffs that LDC or Buyer may have under this Agreement. LDCs obligations
under this _Section 12.18_ shall remain in full force and effect without
regard to, and shall not be released, discharged, or in any way affected by,
any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not LDC shall have any
knowledge thereof) except as may be expressly set forth herein. LDC hereby
waives each of the following: (i) notice of acceptance of the Third-Party
Obligations or of the existence or creation of all or any of the Third-Party
Obligations; (ii) presentment, demand, protest or notice of dishonor,
nonpayment or other default with respect to any of the Third-Party Obligations
and all other notices whatsoever (except for notices to be provided to Buyer,
LDC and its counsel in accordance with this Agreement or applicable Law);
(iii) any requirement that Seller institute suit or otherwise exhaust their
rights or remedies against Buyer or against any other Person prior to
enforcing any rights they have hereunder or otherwise against LDC; and (iv)
all suretyship defenses generally (other than defenses to the payment of the
obligations that are available to LDC or Buyer under this Agreement). Nothing
contained in this _Section 12.18_ shall limit LDCs ability to assert as a
defense to any claim any defense that would be available to Buyer if the claim
were asserted directly against Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by LDC, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the other Parties hereto and LDC, this _Section 12.18_
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of LDC, enforceable against LDC
in accordance with its terms, subject only, as to enforcement, to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws now or
hereinafter in effect affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, LDC is not guaranteeing the obligation of
Buyer to pay, and shall have no obligation to pay, the Closing Payment at the
Closing (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, its portion of the required
equity contributions to Buyer, including the Initial Capital Injection).

 



 

 **12.19** **Waiver of Sovereign Immunity.**

 



 

(a) _Representations Related to a Waiver of Sovereign Immunity_. Each of Buyer
and LDC hereby represent and warrant to Seller:

 



 

(i) Buyer is wholly owned by HoldCo, which, as of the Closing, will be owned
50% by LDC and 50% by Eagle. LDC is a federally chartered corporation

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 477, as amended, and is wholly owned by the Tribe. LDC
is an instrumentality of the Tribe and is entitled to all of the privileges
and immunities of the Tribe but may on its own, without the Tribes consent,
waive any defense of sovereign immunity from suit that it or its directors,
officers, employees or agents may otherwise enjoy under applicable federal,
state or tribal law, arising from any particular agreement, matter or
transaction as may be entered into to further its purposes.

 



 

(ii) LDC is authorized to execute, deliver and perform all documents and
agreements that are required to effectuate the Transaction, including this
Agreement (containing the waiver of sovereign immunity in this _Section
12.19_) and the Related Documents.

 



 

(iii) LDCs Board of Director has determined that neither its Charters nor
Bylaws, nor the Tribes Code, nor any of its or the Tribes other Laws,
ordinances, resolutions or actions, or any of its or the Tribes agencies or
instrumentalities, whether written or established by custom or tradition,
prohibit it or any of its Affiliates or instrumentalities from executing and
delivering this Agreement and the Related Documents and entering into and
performing their obligations with respect to the Transaction. All notices,
filings, documents, resolutions and other matters that are either necessary or
required to be submitted to the Tribes governing body (in either its
governmental capacity or its capacity as a shareholder) and to the BIA for
approval or consent in connection with this Agreement, the Related Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been submitted and
completed LDC has obtained all of the necessary and required approvals and
consents to consummate the Transaction, including any required approvals or
consents from the Tribe. Accordingly, all third parties to whom this Agreement
and any of the Related Documents are delivered in connection with the
Transaction, and their respective successors and assigns, shall be entitled to
rely on grants of authority confirmed herein without further inquiry.

 



 

(iv) Neither Buyer nor HoldCo, nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents, nor any successors or assigns of either party
(including by merger or other combination or reorganization), nor any
Affiliate of Buyer or HoldCo on Buyers or HoldCos behalf, has any right to,
nor are they entitled to, nor will they assert, any defense of sovereign
immunity from suit under applicable federal, state or tribal law.

 



 

(v) Neither Buyer, HoldCo, LDC or, after the Closing, the Company, will agree
to change their corporate structure or be merged into, acquired by, or take
any other action that would result in frustrating the waiver of sovereign
immunity granted herein or, in the case of Buyer, HoldCo and, after the
Closing, the Company, permit any such entity to be entitled to or protected by
sovereign immunity.

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Sovereign Immunity_.

 



 

(i) LDC hereby irrevocably, unequivocally and expressly waives its sovereign
immunity (and any defenses based thereon) and any right of sovereign immunity
it now has or may acquire in the future in any jurisdiction (including any
rights with respect to the Deposit), in each case in favor of Seller and each
of the Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Parties and their respective Representatives for the
interpretation and/or enforcement of LDCs obligations under this Agreement
and the Related Documents (including _Article V_ (to the extent specifically
identified), _Sections 3.6(b)_ , _6.3_ , _6.4_ , _6.5_ , _6.8_ , _6.13_ ,
_6.21_ , _9.2(c)_ and _Article XII_ of this Agreement) by suit or other
Proceeding, whether such suit or Proceeding be brought at law or in equity, or
proceedings of arbitration, or to enforce and execute any order, judgment or
ruling resulting therefrom; _provided_ , that any such order, judgment or
ruling is limited to declaratory or injunctive relief or an award of Damages,
which Damages shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
Further, LDC hereby irrevocably, unequivocally and expressly acknowledges and
agrees that, upon execution of this Agreement, LDCs obligations under this
Agreement and the Related Documents represent current obligations of LDC and,
in the event the equity securities of LDC are transferred to, or acquired by,
any other Person (whether in a merger, consolidation, stock purchase,
exchange, restructuring, reorganization or other transaction regardless of
form), such obligations shall be deemed to have arisen and matured prior to
any such transfer or acquisition and shall survive unimpaired.

 



 

(ii) LDC expressly, unequivocally and irrevocably waives any application of
the doctrine of exhaustion of tribal remedies that might otherwise require, as
a matter of law or comity, that any dispute, controversy, suit, action or
other Proceeding arising under this Agreement, the Related Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby be heard first in a tribal court
or forum or other administrative process of the Tribe.

 



 

(iii) With respect to the foregoing waivers contained in _Section
12.19(b)(i)_ and _(b)(ii)_ , LDC hereby represents and warrants that any and
all actions necessary to authorize and enter into this Agreement and the
Related Documents have been taken and that all notices, consents and other
actions required to authorize such waivers have been given and done.

 



 

(iv) Without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing, LDC
expressly authorizes any governmental instrumentality (meaning any national,
state, local or tribal government (whether domestic or foreign), any political
subdivision thereof or any other governmental, quasi-governmental, judicial,
public or statutory instrumentality, authority, body, agency, bureau or entity
or any arbitrator with authority to bind a party at Law) that has the right
and duty under applicable Law, to take any action authorized or ordered by any
court (including entering onto the property of LDC) to give effect to any
judgment or order entered in any court.

 



 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 12.19(b)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement is intended to act as a waiver of sovereign
immunity of or by the Tribe, which is not a party to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Consent to Forum_. LDC acknowledges and agrees that its duties and
obligations in or related to this Agreement and the Related Documents shall be
enforceable against it in the forums set forth in _Section 12.10_. For
purposes of any Proceeding involving LDC, its controlled Affiliates, or any of
their assets relating to this Agreement or the Related

 



       
 

 



 

Documents, including any issue as to the validity of any waiver of sovereign
immunity contained herein, LDCs Board of Directors, on behalf of LDC, has
irrevocably, unequivocally and unconditionally consented to the personal
jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Delaware and the courts
of the United States located in Delaware on the terms of _Section 12.10_. In
any such Proceeding, LDC agrees not to assert and hereby irrevocably,
unequivocally and unconditionally waives any defense alleging improper venue
or forum non conveniens or the doctrine of exhaustion of tribal remedies.
Further, LDC expressly and irrevocably agrees that it shall not institute any
Proceeding in any tribal courts in respect of any claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Related Documents, but shall instead resort
to the forums set forth in _Section 12.10_ on the terms set forth therein.

 



 

(d) _No Revocation of Sovereign Immunity Waiver_. LDC covenants and agrees
that its waiver of sovereign immunity and other consents and waivers contained
in _Section 12.19(b)_, _(c)_ and _(e)_ (collectively, the " _Sovereign
Immunity Waivers_ ") are irrevocable and it agrees not to revoke or further
limit, in whole or in part, its Sovereign Immunity Waivers or in any way
attempt to revoke or further limit, in whole or in part, such Sovereign
Immunity Waivers. Further, LDC covenants and agrees that the Sovereign
Immunity Waivers shall survive unimpaired and bind the successors of LDC and
its controlled Affiliates, including any Person that acquires equity
securities of LDC or any controlled Affiliate of LDC, whether in a merger,
consolidation, stock purchase, exchange, restructuring, reorganization or
other transaction regardless of form, and in each such case the Sovereign
Immunity Waivers will be in full force and effect and apply unimpaired to the
surviving entity of such transaction to the extent permitted under applicable
Law. Further, LDC covenants and agrees that, from the date hereof until the
ten (10) year anniversary of the Closing Date, (x) it will not sell, assign or
otherwise transfer all or substantially all of the business or assets of LDC
or any controlled Affiliate of LDC (including the Company), in one or a series
of transactions, to any Person with sovereign immunity, whether in an asset
purchase, reorganization, restructuring or other transaction regardless of
form (including a merger, consolidation, exchange, restructuring,
reorganization or other transaction where LDC is not the surviving entity of
such transaction), unless such Person shall have waived its sovereign immunity
in advance of such transaction in the same form (in all material respects) as
the Sovereign Immunity Waivers, and in each such case such advance sovereign
immunity waiver will be in full force and effect and apply unimpaired to the
transferee, assign or surviving entity, as applicable, of such transaction,
and (y) the consideration received by LDC in any transaction contemplated by
the foregoing _clause (x)_ shall be available to the Seller Indemnified
Parties in the event LDC breaches its obligation to secure an advance waiver
of sovereign immunity in accordance with the foregoing _clause (x)_ and LDC
shall hold such consideration free and clear of all Liens (other than
customary Liens under the LDC Financing) or intercompany agreements and shall
not declare any dividends or other distributions of any portion of such
consideration until the date of the final resolution of any and all disputes
or Proceedings between the parties hereto relating to such breach. In the
event that LDC (i) revokes, further limits or attempts to revoke or further
limit the Sovereign Immunity Waivers granted under this _Section 12.19_, (ii)
takes any action that is inconsistent with the Sovereign Immunity Waivers or
other covenants granted in this _Section 12.19_ or (iii) fails to submit to
the Law or jurisdiction of the state or federal courts as provided in
_Sections 12.9_ , _12.10_ , _12.11_ and _12.19_ , the parties hereto expressly
recognize and agree that (A) there remains no adequate remedy at law available
to the Seller and/or the Seller Indemnified Parties, (B) Seller and/or the
Seller Indemnified Parties will be irreparably injured upon any revocation or
further limitation of

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 12.19_, and (C) LDC hereby consents to the entry of appropriate
injunctive relief, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
In the event of any attempted limitation or revocation of the Sovereign
Immunity Waivers granted herein, Seller and/or the Seller Indemnified Parties
may immediately seek judicial injunctive relief as provided in this _Section
12.19_ in any court specified in _Section 12.10_ of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Lender or LDC Financing Source shall have any
obligation or liability under this _Section 12.19(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Applicable Law_. With regard to applicable Law, LDC acknowledges that
this Agreement and the Related Documents shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with applicable federal law and the Laws of the State of Delaware
(exclusive of its conflict of law principles); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Laws of the Tribe shall be applicable solely as guidance to construe and
interpret the nature of LDC and its relationship to its sole shareholder, the
Tribe, such Laws of the Tribe being limited to the Tribes Constitution, Code
(https://www2.municode.com/library/nm/pueblo_of_laguna/codes/tribal_code) and
Shareholder Resolutions, as well as LDCs Charter.

 



 

(f) _Scope of Waiver_. This waiver is subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and the Related Documents. LDC does not waive its immunity for any
other purpose or for any other person or entity not named in this _Section
12.19_. These provisions for a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, consent
to jurisdiction, enforcement and selection of law shall be effective from and
after all parties to this Agreement have duly executed this Agreement. The
execution of this Agreement and any applicable Related Documents shall
constitute consent and agreement to the waiver, consent, forum, enforcement
and selection of law provisions contained in this _Section 12.19_.

otherwise, brought or supported against any Lender or LDC Financing Source,
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment

with the foregoing or the performance of any services thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof and
each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably submits itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such

that would result in the application of the laws of another state), (c) agrees
not to bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support
any action, including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether

Source in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing,
the Commitment Letter, any LDC Financing or any of the agreements entered into

effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action in any

 



      
 

 



 

such court, and (e) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right to a trial by jury in any
action brought against any Lender or LDC Financing Source in any way arising
out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter,
any LDC Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the
foregoing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder. Further, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties to this Agreement on
behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates hereby agrees that, except if and
to the extent expressly and specifically assumed in a written agreement of the
applicable Lender or LDC Financing Source including the rights of the parties
to the agreements governing the Financing, the Commitment Letter and any LDC
Financing, no Lender or LDC Financing Source will have any liability to any
Party (or any other Person) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing, the Commitment Letter, any LDC Financing or any of the agreements
entered into in connection with the foregoing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
and that it shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, or employees to seek any action for
specific performance against any Lender or LDC Financing Source relating to or
in any way arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment
Letter, any LDC Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing shall not limit in any manner any remedy of the Seller
Indemnified Parties against Buyer, LDC or any of their respective successors
or assigns (whether by merger, combination or other reorganization) under this
Agreement, including any remedy against Buyer, LDC or any of their respective
successors or assigns (whether by merger, combination or other reorganization)
for breach of any arrangements related to the Financing, the Commitment
Letter, any LDC Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection
with the foregoing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the performance of any services thereunder, but subject in all cases to the
terms set forth in this Agreement.
