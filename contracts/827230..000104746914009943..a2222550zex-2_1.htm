AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 13, 2014, by and among MF Parent LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "), MF Merger Sub Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and MicroFinancial Incorporated, a Massachusetts corporation (" _Seller_ "). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings given thereto in _Section 10.11_. 

   

 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Purchaser, Seller and the general partner of Parent have unanimously approved the acquisition of Seller by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer to purchase all of Seller\'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Seller Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of $10.20, net to the Seller Stockholders in cash, without interest, subject to any tax withholding (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ ," and such tender offer, the " _Offer_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into Seller, with Seller as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ " and, together with the Offer, the " _Transaction_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding share of Seller Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or Seller will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Seller Board has (i)(A) determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of Seller and the Seller Stockholders, (B) approved the Offer and the Merger in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (" _MBCA_ ") and (C) adopted this Agreement, and (ii) recommended that the Seller Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Seller Common Stock (" _Shares_ ") into the Offer, and if required by applicable Law, adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Fortress Credit Opportunities Fund III (A) LP, Fortress Credit Opportunities Fund III (B) LP, Fortress Credit Opportunities Fund III (C) L.P., Fortress Credit Opportunities Fund III (D) L.P., Fortress Credit Opportunities Fund III (E) LP and Parent have entered into a commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Commitment Letter_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to Parent\'s entering into this Agreement, certain Seller Stockholders (the " _Supporting Stockholders_ ") are entering into a tender and stockholder support agreement (the " _Tender and Support Agreement_ ") with Parent and Purchaser simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, whereby, among other things, such stockholders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to tender the Shares held by such stockholders (in their individual capacities) in the Offer and to support the actions necessary to consummate the Merger; 

   

 WHEREAS, certain Seller Stockholders are entering into a contribution, non-tender and support agreement (the " _Contribution Agreement_ ") with Parent whereby such stockholders have agreed to contribute the Shares owned by such stockholders and identified in the Contribution Agreement (the " _Contribution Shares_ ") to Parent following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time upon admission as limited partners of Parent; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Transaction and to prescribe certain conditions to the Transaction.      

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER 

  

 1.1 _ _ _The Offer_. 

  

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ hereof and that none of the events set forth in clause 3(a) or clause 3(i) of _Annex I_ shall have occurred, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition), Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly after the Expiration Date, accept for payment and pay for, after giving effect to any withholding tax, all Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn. 

   

 (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). The latest time and date that the Offer, as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_, may expire shall be referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

  

 (c) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to): 

    

 (i) if, on the initial expiration date of the Offer or upon the expiration of any subsequent offering period, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), until such time as all Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied; and 

  

 (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; 

   

  

 _provided_ that, (A) Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date or termination of this Agreement and (B) if, on the
initial expiration date of the Offer or upon the expiration of any subsequent
offering period, all of the Tender Offer Conditions except for the Minimum
Condition are satisfied or have been waived, Seller may require Purchaser to
extend the Offer for an additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days in
the aggregate, and Purchaser may extend the Offer for one or more additional
periods not to exceed, in the aggregate, twenty (20) Business Days.

  

  

 (d) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its sole discretion; _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of Seller, Purchaser shall not: 

    

 (i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; 

  

 (ii) reduce the Offer Price or the number of Shares subject to the Offer; 

  

 (iii) extend the expiration date of the Offer (except as required or permitted by the other provisions of this _Section 1.1_); 

  

 (iv) waive or amend the Minimum Condition; 

  

 (v) add to the Tender Offer Conditions; 

   

      

   

 (vi) modify any Tender Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares; or 

  

 (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner materially adverse to holders of Shares. 

    

 (e) Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller, elect to provide one or more subsequent offering periods for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act following its acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer. If immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries beneficially own more than 70% but less than 90% of the shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding at that time (which shares beneficially owned shall include shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn), to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, Purchaser shall provide for a subsequent offering period of up to five (5) Business Days. 

  

 (f) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto) with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary documents and instruments required thereby pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Seller Stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Seller shall furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning Seller required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents, and if not previously withdrawn in accordance with _Section 7.2_, Seller hereby consents to the inclusion of the Seller Recommendations in the Offer Documents. Seller and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Seller or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) promptly provide Seller with a copy of any written comments (or a description of any oral comments) received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents; (ii) consult with Seller prior to responding to such comments; (iii) provide Seller with the opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto; and (iv) provide Seller with a copy of any written responses thereto. 

  

 (g) If at any time before the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, Seller, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by Seller or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Seller Stockholders as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange. 

  

 (h) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall and Parent shall cause Purchaser to accept for payment, and promptly after the expiration of the Offer, pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement (including the exercise of the Top-Up Option) and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Purchaser and Seller, any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until 

  

      

  

the shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or
on behalf of Purchaser.

  

  

 1.2 _ _ _Seller Actions_. 

  

  

 (a) Seller hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that no Shares held by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (b) Seller shall, after affording Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel, (i) file with the SEC and mail to the Seller Stockholders, as promptly as practicable on the date of the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), which shall include, subject to _Section 7.2_, the Seller Recommendations and (ii) disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Seller shall not permit any "Adverse Recommendation Change," except as specifically provided in _Section 7.2_ hereof. Seller shall include in its entirety in the Schedule 14D-9, and has obtained all necessary consents to permit the inclusion in its entirety of, the fairness opinion of Seller\'s Financial Advisor delivered to the Seller Board in connection with the Transaction. Parent and Purchaser shall furnish to Seller all information concerning Parent and Purchaser required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Schedule 14D-9 shall be made by Seller without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Seller agrees to (i) promptly provide Parent and Purchaser with a copy of any written comments (or a description of any oral comments) received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9; (ii) consult with Parent and Purchaser prior to responding to such comments; (iii) provide Parent and Purchaser with the opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto; and (iv) provide Parent and Purchaser with a copy of any written responses thereto. 

  

 (c) If at any time before the Effective Time, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, Seller, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by Seller or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 so that the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Seller Stockholders, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange. 

  

 (d) In connection with the Offer, Seller will promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) furnish Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all shareholders of record, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall furnish Purchaser with such additional available information (including updated lists of holders of Shares and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and computer files) and such other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to, and soliciting tenders of Shares from, Seller\'s record and beneficial stockholders and any and all related correspondence to the record and 

  

      

  

beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are reasonably related to the dissemination of
the Offer Documents and the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, Parent,
Purchaser and their Representatives shall keep such information confidential
and use the information contained in any such labels, listings and files only
in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is
terminated, will promptly upon Seller\'s request, destroy or deliver to Seller
all copies of such information then in their possession.

  

  

 1.3 _ _ _Directors_. 

  

  

 (a) Promptly after the first time at which Purchaser accepts for payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and from time to time thereafter as Shares are accepted for payment and the Offer Price is paid by Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate immediately such number of members of the Seller Board (the " _Purchaser Designees_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give Purchaser representation on the Seller Board equal to (x) the product of the total number of members of the Seller Board (after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence and any director resignations pursuant to this Section) multiplied by (y) the percentage that (A) the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment), together with the Contribution Shares, bears to (B) the total number of Shares then outstanding; _provided_ that in no event shall the Purchaser Designees constitute less than a majority of the Seller Board. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall, upon the request of Parent or Purchaser, use its best efforts to promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) either increase the size of the Seller Board (including by amending the Bylaws, if necessary) or to secure the resignations of such number of Seller\'s incumbent directors (and such incumbent directors have agreed to resign if required in order for Seller to comply with this _Section 1.3(a))_, or both, as is necessary to enable the Purchaser Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Seller Board, and Seller shall take all actions available to Seller to cause the Purchaser Designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, Seller shall promptly, if requested by Purchaser, also take all action necessary to cause persons designated by Purchaser to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Seller Board of (i) each committee of the Seller Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Seller Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board. The provisions of this _Section 1.3_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (b) Seller\'s obligations to appoint the Purchaser Designees to the Seller Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the applicable NASDAQ rules and regulations. Seller shall promptly take all actions required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_, including mailing to stockholders the information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 not later than such time as is necessary to enable the Purchaser Designees to be elected or appointed to the Seller Board at the Acceptance Time. Parent shall supply to Seller any information with respect to itself, Purchaser and their respective nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.3(a)_, at least three of the members of the Seller Board shall, at all times before the Effective Time, be directors of Seller who were directors of Seller on the date hereof and who otherwise qualify as "independent directors" pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and Rule 14d-10(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ that if there shall be in office less than three Continuing Directors for any reason, the Seller Board shall cause the Person designated by the remaining Continuing Directors to fill such vacancy, which designee shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes 

  

      

  

of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of Seller then in office shall designate three persons to fill such
vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or Affiliates of
Parent or Purchaser, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time that the
Purchaser Designees are elected or appointed to the Seller Board and before
the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, the approval of a majority of
the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and
such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Seller Board and
no other action on the part of Seller, including any action by any other

(iii) any decrease in or change of form of the Merger Consideration, (iv) any
extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Purchaser, (v) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein for the benefit of Seller, (vi) any

 1.4 _ _ _Top-Up Option_. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_ and _Section 1.4(c)_, Seller hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from Seller, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, the number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Purchaser as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares outstanding immediately after exercise of such option (the " _Top-Up Shares_ "); _provided_ , that the Top-Up Option may only be exercised (i) to the extent the aggregate number of Top-Up Shares does not exceed the aggregate number of authorized Shares at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option which are not then outstanding, and (ii) if Purchaser irrevocably commits upon acquisition of the Top-Up Shares to effect the merger pursuant to _Section 2.7_. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Acceptance Time, or if any subsequent offering period is provided, during the five (5)-Business Day period following the expiration date of such subsequent offering period, _provided_ that Parent or Purchaser has accepted for payment all shares of Seller Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) The aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option so exercised may be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either (i) in cash or (ii) by executing and delivering to Seller a promissory note having a principal amount equal to such payment, or by any combination of cash and such promissory note. Such promissory note shall bear simple interest of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery thereof, may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and shall have no other material terms. The Seller Board has determined that such consideration for the Top-Up Shares is adequate. 

  

 (c) In the event that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it shall deliver to Seller a notice setting forth (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser at the time of such notice, (ii) the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares by Purchaser is to take place. Seller shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (but in any event within one (1) Business Day), deliver written notice to Parent and Purchaser specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of 

  

      

  

the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to
Seller the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up
Shares, and Seller shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate
representing such Shares or, if Seller does not then have certificated Shares,
the applicable number of book-entry Shares.

  

 (d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to Seller that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "Accredited Investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent and Purchaser represent to Seller that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act and they acknowledge that such shares may not be transferred without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.

 (ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to this Agreement, and use its reasonable efforts (x) to obtain and furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the proxy statement and, after consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy statement and cause a definitive proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be mailed to its stockholders, and (y) to obtain the necessary adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by its stockholders; 

  

 (iii) subject to the fiduciary duties of the Seller Board, include in the Proxy Statement the Seller Recommendations that the Seller Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; and

thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Proxy Statement

 (c) If at any time prior to Seller Stockholders\' meeting, any information relating to Seller, Parent or Purchaser, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by Seller or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to Seller Stockholders.

 2.7 _ _ _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.6_, in the event that, at any time following the Acceptance Time or the final Expiration Date, Purchaser shall own at least 90% of the Shares, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including the Contribution Shares, which Parent covenants to transfer to Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable after the Contribution Closing (as such term is defined in the Contribution Agreement)), subject to _Sections 8.1(c)_ and _8.1(d)_ , the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter, without a meeting of Seller Stockholders, in accordance with Section 11.05 of the MBCA. 

  

    
ARTICLE III 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SELLER 
CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

 3.1 _ _ _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party hereto or of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of Seller or capital stock of Purchaser: 

       

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of Purchaser._ Each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Certain Stock._ All Shares that are owned by Seller or by any wholly-owned Seller Subsidiary and all Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser immediately before the Effective Time (including the Contribution Shares), shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _ Conversion of Seller Common Stock._ Each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b) _and (ii) Dissenting Shares as defined in _Section 3.3_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares, when converted as provided in this _Section 3.1(c)_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ " and collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry share (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender thereof in accordance with _Section 3.2_. 

  

  

 3.2 _ _ _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding Shares for the Merger Consideration are as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ Before the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration. Before the Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited, or caused to be deposited, with the Paying Agent good funds in an amount sufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1_ in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ (such funds, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall initially be insufficient to make all such payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares which, immediately before the Effective Time represented Shares converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(c) _ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(h) _ hereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and Seller may mutually agree or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to 

  

      

  

receive in exchange therefor cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Shares previously represented by such Certificate or such
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Seller Common Stock which has not been registered in the transfer records of
Seller, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until so surrendered, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such
surrender. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and from and after the Effective Time the stock transfer books of Seller shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. If, for any reason, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent after the Effective Time, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share who has not previously complied with this _Section 3.2_ before the end of such six (6) month period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent, Purchaser, Seller, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (f) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund and be payable to Parent. 

  

 (g) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, Offer Price or consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, a Book-Entry Share, a Seller Restricted Stock Unit or a Seller Stock Option, as the case may be, such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Seller Restricted Stock Unit or Seller Stock Option, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

      

  

 (h) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

  

 3.3 _ _ _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Seller Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that are held by the Seller Stockholders who, in accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of adopting this Agreement or approving the consummation of the Merger, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with the Appraisal Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") will not be converted into the Merger Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_ that all Shares held by the Seller Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_. 

   

 (b) Seller shall give Parent and Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by Seller for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands subject, before the Effective Time, to consultation with Seller. Except (i) upon the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or (ii) as required by a final, binding and non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Seller shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand. 

  

 (c) Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such Shares shall be canceled. 

  

  

 3.4 _ _ _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock Units_. 

  

  

 (a) Each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, and that is not then vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable fifteen days prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option that was outstanding and unexercised immediately before the Effective Time shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment (without interest), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price for such Seller Stock Option and (ii) the total number of shares underlying such Seller Stock Option (giving effect to the acceleration of vesting contemplated by this _Section 3.4(a)_), with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent. Seller shall provide that following the Effective Time and subject to _Section 3.4(b)_, no holder of a 

  

      

  

Seller Stock Option (or former holder of a Seller Stock Option) shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of Seller or the Surviving
Corporation or any other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock
or stock appreciation rights).

  

 (b) Each Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall become fully vested and cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment (without interest), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares underlying such Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award (giving effect to the acceleration of vesting contemplated by this _Section 3.4(b)_), with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent. 

  

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, the Seller Board or appropriate Seller Board committee shall make all determinations necessary under the Seller Stock Plan to accomplish the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.4_. Conditional upon the Closing, Seller shall take all necessary steps to effect the termination of the Seller Stock Plan as of the Effective Time, it being the intention of the parties that no holder of any Seller Stock Option shall have any continuing right to acquire Shares thereunder. Reasonably before the Closing, Seller shall provide notice (subject to Parent\'s reasonable review) to each holder of Seller Stock Options and Seller Restricted Stock Units (i) describing the treatment thereof in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ and (ii) for administrative convenience, prohibiting further exercises of Seller Stock Options after the third (3rd) Business Day before the Closing Date. 

  

  

 3.5 _ _ _Adjustments_. If, prior to the Effective Time, there shall occur any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration (as applicable) and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect the effects of such change. Nothing herein shall be construed to permit Seller to take any action with respect to the Shares or other securities of Seller that is prohibited by this Agreement. 

  

    
ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
OF PARENT AND PURCHASER 

  

 Except as set forth in the letter delivered concurrently with the execution of this Agreement to Seller, which letter shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (with reference to the particular Section to which such information relates; _provided_ that an item disclosed in any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement where the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section of this Agreement is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Seller as follows: 

  

 4.1 _ _ _Corporate Organization_. 

  

  

 (a) Parent is a limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware. Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (b) Parent has all requisite partnership power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good standing has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the certificate of limited partnership of Parent and the articles of organization and bylaws of Purchaser that have previously been made available to Seller are true, correct and complete copies of such documents as currently in effect. 

  

 (c) Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Purchaser, which, as of the date hereof, consist of 2,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned beneficially and of record by Parent, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Except for obligations and liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser has not and will not have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements with any Person that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 4.2 _ _ _Authority_. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite partnership or corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and perform its obligations hereunder. The adoption, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been recommended by, and are duly and validly authorized by all necessary action of, each of Parent and Purchaser. Except for the filing of the Articles of Merger, no other partnership or corporate Proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the adoption, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or to consummate each of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller), constitutes the valid and binding obligations of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

 5.1 _ _ _Corporate Organization_. 

  

  

 (a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in corporate good standing would not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Articles of Organization and the Bylaws of Seller that have previously been made available to Parent and Purchaser are true, correct, and complete copies of such documents as currently in effect. 

  

 (b) The entities listed in Section 5.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Seller Subsidiary_ "), together with their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, are the only Subsidiaries of Seller. Each Seller Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good standing would not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary. The copies of organizational documents of the Seller Subsidiaries that have previously been made available to Parent and Purchaser are true, correct, and complete copies of such documents as currently in effect. 

  

 (c) Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary: (i) owns any share capital of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any other Person, other than the Seller Subsidiaries, or (ii) has agreed or is obligated to make, or is bound by any agreement under which it may become obligated to make, any material future investment in or material capital contribution to any other Person. 

  

       

 5.2 _ _ _Capitalization_. 

  

  

 (a) The authorized capital stock of Seller consists of 25,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Seller Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on December 12, 2014, there were 14,433,154 Shares and no shares of Seller Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, and there were no Shares and no shares of Seller Preferred Stock held in the treasury of Seller.

There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having general voting rights, or convertible into securities having such rights (" _Voting Debt_ "), of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary issued and outstanding. Except for instruments issued under the Seller Stock Plan, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements, or agreements of any character calling for Seller to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold any Shares or Seller Preferred Stock or any other equity security or Voting Debt of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise receive any Shares or Seller Preferred Stock or any other equity security or Voting Debt of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or obligating Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements or any other similar agreements. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Seller to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests or Voting Debt in Seller or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Seller Subsidiary. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements, or agreements of any character calling for any Seller Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold any shares of repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock or other equity interests. All of the interests or shares of capital stock of each of the Seller Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and, with respect to such interests or shares held directly or indirectly by Seller, are owned by Seller free and clear of any Encumbrance. No Seller Subsidiary owns any Shares.

There are no Shares outstanding that are subject to vesting over time or upon the satisfaction of any condition precedent or that are otherwise subject to any right or obligation of repurchase or redemption on the part of Seller. 

  

      

  

 (c) There are no voting trusts or other agreements to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of any Shares or any capital stock of, or other equity interest of, Seller or any Seller Subsidiary.

Seller\'s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Seller in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Seller\'s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Seller to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Seller\'s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Seller\'s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

 5.26 _ _ _Leases_. 

  

  

 (a) Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, as the case may be, is the sole legal and beneficial owner of all right, title and interest in and to (i) each Lease to which it is a party, and (ii) the underlying leased property and/or equipment that is the subject thereof (the " _Leased Property or Equipment_ "). 

  

 (b) Seller or a Seller Subsidiary is in physical possession of all Lease Files for each Lease. All Lease Files (i) are correct and complete in all material respects and (ii) contain all of the Lease Documents necessary to enforce the rights of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, as the case may be, with respect to each Lease. 

  

 (c) All of the Leases are either (i) consistent, in all material respects, with the form(s) thereof provided in the Data Room, or (ii) dealer forms that (x) have been approved by Seller\'s management and (y) do not contain any terms that are materially less favorable to Seller or the Seller Subsidiary party thereto than the form(s) of Lease provided in the Data Room. 

  

 (d) Each Lease is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Lessee thereunder and is enforceable in accordance with its terms. No Lease is subject to any valid right of rescission, set-off, abatement, diminution, counterclaim or defense. None of the execution of this Agreement by Seller, the performance of Seller of any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (i) require the consent of any other party to such Lease, (ii) do not, and will not, cause or result in a breach or default under any Lease Documents, or (iii) otherwise cause any Lease Documents to cease to be legal, valid, binding or enforceable, or in full force and effect, in accordance with its terms. There are no disputes pending or, to the Seller\'s knowledge, threatened with respect to any Lease, and neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received written notice of any of the foregoing or of the intention of any other party to Leases aggregating more than one percent (1%) of the total 

  

       

  

receivables due in installments under current Leases to terminate such Leases
(nor, to the Seller\'s knowledge, is any such party threatening to do so).

  

 (e) Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with their respective obligations to the Lessees under the Leases. Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in default or material breach under any Lease Document. Each Lease was originated by Seller or a Seller Subsidiary and each Lease was approved by Seller or a Seller Subsidiary in accordance with its then applicable credit policies and established approval processes. No provision of any Lease Document has been waived, modified, or altered in any respect that is materially adverse to Seller. 

  

 (f) As of the date hereof, none of the Leased Property or Equipment is subject to any proceedings instituted by any applicable Governmental Authority that would materially and adversely affect the value of such Leased Property or Equipment or would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no other Person, has engaged in fraud or has made any material and intentional misrepresentation with respect to any Lease. 

   

 (g) Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary provides any repair, maintenance or other services, nor have they provided any warranty, guaranty, indemnity or similar arrangement or agreement, with respect to any Leased Property or Equipment. 

  

 (h) The allowance for credit losses and credit quality reflected on the Seller Balance Sheet as further described in the notes thereto and on the Seller balance sheet as of October 31, 2014 included in Section 5.26(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter were adequate as of the respective dates thereof, in each case in accordance with GAAP. 

   

 (i) As of the date hereof, there are no material outages, failures or malfunctions of Seller\'s and the Seller Subsidiaries\' automated servicing and collection system, including, without limitation, in respect of application tracking, invoicing, payment processing, automated collection queuing, portfolio evaluation, report writing, payment processing or the direct withdrawal of lease or contract payments from a Lessee\'s bank account. 

  

  

 5.27 _ _ _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_, neither Seller nor any other Person on behalf of Seller makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or with respect to any other information provided to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 7.2 _ _ _No Solicitation_. 

  

  

 (a) Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall use its best efforts to cause all of its and their respective other Representatives to (i) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, negotiations or offer pending on the date of this Agreement that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any Person within the last 12 months for the purposes of evaluating a possible Acquisition Proposal and (iii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall not, and shall cause Seller Subsidiaries not to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, (A) any standstill provision in any agreement to which Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries is a party or (B) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which Seller or any of Seller Subsidiaries is a party and shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights thereunder; _provided_ , that (x) this clause (B) shall not prohibit any waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a confidentiality provision entered into in connection with the ordinary course operation of Seller\'s business that does not, and would not reasonably be expected to, facilitate or encourage a possible Acquisition Proposal, and (y) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, before the Acceptance Time, Seller may, to the extent the Seller Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Seller\'s outside legal counsel, that the enforcement of any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, not enforce any such agreement to which the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party; provided, in each case, that Seller has not breached and is not in breach of, and the taking of such actions would not result in a breach by Seller of, this _Section 7.2_. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, Seller shall, and shall cause Seller Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement. 

   

 (b) Seller shall not, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all of its and their respective other Representatives not to, (i) directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the submission of any indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information to any Person (other than Parent or Purchaser) in connection with, or take any other action intended to, or that would reasonably be expected to, facilitate the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by _Section 7.2(c)_), or (iv) approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting any of the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on Seller set forth in this _Section 7.2_ by any Seller Subsidiary or any director, officer or employee of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries (or any other Representative of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries that is authorized, instructed, sanctioned or knowingly encouraged or caused to act by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary) shall be conclusively deemed a breach of this _Section 7.2_ by Seller. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if Seller or its Representatives receive an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.2_ and the Seller Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the failure to so respond to such 

  

      

  

Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Seller Stockholders under applicable Law, Seller may
take the following actions: (A) furnish information with respect to Seller
and/or any Seller Subsidiary to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal (a " _Qualified Bidder_ "); _provided_ Seller first receives from
the Qualified Bidder a duly executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and
_provided further_ that Seller concurrently provides or makes available to
Parent any information concerning Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries provided
to such third party which was not previously provided to Parent and (B)
engage in discussions or negotiations with the Qualified Bidder and its
Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.2(c)_ by any Representatives
of Seller shall be deemed to be a breach by Seller of this _Section 7.2_.
Seller shall promptly notify Parent if Seller furnishes non-
public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 7.2(c)_.

  

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.2(f)_, neither the Seller Board nor any committee of the Seller Board may (i)(A) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser the Seller Recommendations, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Seller Recommendations (or any portion thereof), or resolve to take any such action, (B) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or resolve to take any such action, (C) following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or sent or given to the Seller Stockholders, fail to issue a press release reaffirming the Seller Recommendations within five (5) Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the second Business Day prior to the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer) or (D) fail to include the Seller Recommendations in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Seller Stockholders (any of the foregoing, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, or authorize, cause or permit Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 7.2_) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action. 

  

 (e) If Seller Board receives a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.2(e)_, provided that Seller Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Seller Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or Seller may terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 9.1(h) _ and subject to compliance with _Section 9.2(b)_; _provided_ that prior to so making an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, (i) Seller gives Parent at least three (3) Business Days\' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any such Superior Proposal and a copy of the Superior Proposal and any proposed Acquisition Agreements and financing commitments relating thereto, (ii) Seller negotiates, and uses reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) upon the end of such notice period, Seller Board considers in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if the revisions proposed by Parent were to 

  

      

  

be given effect and (iv) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of such Superior Proposal, Seller shall, in each
case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (i) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (i) of this
proviso shall commence (except that the three Business Day notice period
referred to in clause (i) of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer
of (A) two Business Days and (B) the period remaining under the notice period
under clause (i) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (iv)) during which time Seller shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.2(e)_ anew with
respect to such additional notice, including clauses (i) through (iv) of this
proviso; _provided further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary shall enter into
any Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

   

 (f) In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the Acceptance Time, the Seller Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof if, and only if, Seller Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that, the Seller Board shall not be entitled to take such action pursuant to this sentence unless Seller has (x) provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days\' prior written notice advising Parent that the Seller Board intends to take such action and describing in reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the reasons for taking such actions, (y) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engages (and uses reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to engage) in good faith negotiations with to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would permit Seller Board not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 7.2(f)_, and (z) upon the end of such five (5) Business Day period, Seller Board shall consider in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and following the fulfillment of its obligations under clauses (x), (y) and (z) of this _Section 7.2(f)_ nevertheless determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that Seller Board\'s failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any such Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Seller Board, nor shall any Adverse Recommendation Change have the effect of causing any state (including Massachusetts) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 (g) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of the receipt of any inquiries, proposals or expressions of interest with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, together with all material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy or, if such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a written description of such material terms and conditions) and the identity of the Person such inquiry, proposal or expression of interest. Seller shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any material change to the financial terms, conditions, or other material terms) of any such inquiries, proposals or expressions of interest, and any related negotiations or discussions, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, on a reasonably current basis (and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material occurrence, change, development, discussion or negotiations) and (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written material relating to any Acquisition Proposal or, where no such written materials are available, a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof). Seller shall not, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is party to any agreement, in each case that prohibits from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 7.2_. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (h) Nothing in this _Section 7.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit Seller from complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Seller Board or a committee of the Seller Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law (it being understood that any such compliance with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) may constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change). In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by Seller that describes Seller\'s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Seller Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to the Seller Stockholders, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 15% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to 662/3% for these purposes) made by a third party (A) on terms which Seller Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, are more favorable to the Seller Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transaction, taking into account all the terms and conditions (including all financial, regulatory, financing, conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions) of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) that Seller Board determines is reasonably likely to be completed on a timely basis on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, financing, timing, conditionality, legal and other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 (j) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer for any transaction or series of related transactions, whether or not in writing, involving (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction involving Seller, pursuant to which any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than the holders of Seller Common Stock (as a group) immediately before the consummation of such transaction, would hold securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of Seller after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction, (ii) a direct or indirect sale, lease (other than any purchase of assets from dealers or any lease of assets to customers in the Seller\'s ordinary course of business), license, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition of assets that constitute at least 15% of the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) a purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) of "beneficial ownership" (for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, (iv) liquidation or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution) of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend (whether in cash or other property) by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary; _provided_ that the term "extraordinary dividend" will not include quarterly dividends paid in the ordinary course of business on the Seller Common Stock in amounts not exceeding $0.08 per share, or (v) any combination of the foregoing; _provided_ that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Offer and the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

  

  

 7.3 _ _ _Access to Information_. 

  

  

 (a) Until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Seller shall, and shall cause each of the Seller Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of Parent, reasonable 

  

      

  

access without undue interruption during normal business hours to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records (other than confidential
information contained in personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such
information is prohibited by privacy Laws), and their accountants and
accountants\' work papers. Seller also shall provide Parent with such access
to the appropriate individuals (including management personnel, attorneys,
accountants and other professionals) for discussion of Seller\'s business,
properties, prospects and personnel as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably
request. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any Law, Order or binding agreement entered into
before the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate
or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product
privilege. The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. In furtherance of the
foregoing, no information identifying individual employees or consultants of
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or protected personal information regarding
such employees or consultants will be disclosed under this Agreement
(including in the Seller Disclosure Letter) in respect of employees or
consultants that are employed (or were employed and remain domiciled) in
any country that has enacted legislation implementing the EU Personal Data
Privacy Directive or similar legislation, except to the extent permitted by a
contractual undertaking entered into by Seller and Parent regarding
maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect
compliance with such legislation.

  

 (b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

  

 7.4 _ _ _Employment and Benefit Matters_. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the accuracy and completeness of Seller\'s representation set forth in _Section 5.13_, for twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Seller Personnel who remains employed after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Seller Employees_ ") hourly wages, base salary, cash incentive opportunities, health and other welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements (in each case excluding equity compensation and any defined benefit plan) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation, wages, salary, cash incentive opportunities, health and other welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements (in each case excluding equity compensation and any defined benefit plan) provided to such Seller Personnel immediately before the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which Seller Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service of Seller Employees with Seller or any Seller Subsidiary attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent for all eligibility to participate and vesting purposes. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to waive any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any health or similar plan of the Surviving Corporation with respect to Seller Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which Seller Employees participated immediately before the Acceptance Time, and any deductibles paid by Seller Employees under any of Seller\'s or the Seller Subsidiaries\' health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs shall be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation. Except as provided in the Seller Compensation Arrangements or any employment agreements entered into by Seller Employees with Parent or Purchaser, Seller Employees shall be considered to be employed by Parent "at will" and nothing shall be construed 

  

      

  

to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the
employment of any such Seller Employee at any time.

  

 (b) Subject to _Section 7.4(a)_ hereof, Parent shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of Seller. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this _Section 7.4_, expressed or implied, shall confer upon any Seller Personnel (or any of their beneficiaries or alternate payees) any rights or remedies (including any right to employment or continued employment, or any right to compensation or benefits for any period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement or otherwise. In addition, the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and are not for the benefit of any third party. 

  

  

 7.5 _ _ _Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

  

 (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") provided for in the respective organizational documents of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries (as the case may be), in effect as of the date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect (and with respect to Seller, shall be reflected in the applicable organizational documents of such entity), for a period of six (6) years after the Acceptance Time. During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Acceptance Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law; _provided_ that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made either before the Acceptance Time or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims. 

  

 (b) Before the Effective Time, Seller shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of Seller and each Subsidiary of Seller (collectively, the " _Covered Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, investigation or Proceeding (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as officers or directors, in each case occurring before the Acceptance Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim, investigation or Proceeding, (i) Seller or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be entitled to control the defense of such claim, investigation or Proceeding, (ii) if Seller, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or counsel selected by the applicable insurer of Seller or the Surviving Corporation) does not elect to control the defense of such claim, investigation or Proceeding, the Covered Party shall be entitled to select counsel for the Covered Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Seller or to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and Seller or Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel promptly after statements therefor are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect to defend such action), (iii) the Covered Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iv) none of Seller, Parent or the 

  

       

  

Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

 (c) At or before the Effective Time, Seller shall purchase directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (which by its terms shall survive the Offer and the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time on terms acceptable to Seller, so long as the aggregate cost of such insurance is less than 300% of the annual premium paid by Seller currently for its existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) The obligations under this _Section 7.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.5_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.5_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_ and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein). 

  

 (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_. 

  

  

 7.6 _ _ _Financing_. Parent shall use its best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Purchaser to obtaining the Cash Merger Funds set forth in the Commitment Letter that are within their control, and (iii) consummate the funding of the Cash Merger Funds at or prior to the Acceptance Time (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and at or prior to the Effective Time (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger), which may be in the form of all equity or a combination of equity and debt. Parent shall not, and shall cause Purchaser not to, without the prior written consent of Seller, amend, modify or supplement any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Commitment Letter or any other provision of the Commitment Letter, in either case, to the extent such amendment, modification or supplement would reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially adversely affecting the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. 

  

 7.7 _ _ _Advice of Changes_. Parent and Seller shall each promptly notify the other party of any change or event having a Parent Material Adverse Effect or Seller Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which it believes would otherwise be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

   

 7.8 _ _ _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.2_, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor Seller shall, or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; provided that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any 

        

press release or other announcement with respect to the Transaction or this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to the
other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by _Section 7.2_
or any disclosure of Parent or Purchaser in response thereto or in connection
therewith.

  

 7.9 _ _ _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and Seller agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Seller who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Offer and the Merger, both before and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 7.9_. Promptly after the date hereof and before the Expiration Date, Seller shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Seller to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

   

 7.10 _ _ _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, or agreement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Seller Personnel unless, before such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Seller Compensation Committee shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve each such plan, program, or agreement as an Approved Seller Compensation Arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, payment, benefit or agreement. 

  

 (b) In the event that, during the period ending not less than five (5) calendar days before the Expiration Date, Parent requests that the Seller Compensation Committee consider whether any plan, program, or agreement that Parent would like to enter into, establish, amend or modify pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Seller Personnel (each such plan, program, or any agreement, a " _Post-Signing Arrangement_ "), would constitute a Seller Compensation Arrangement and provides Seller with such information with respect to such Post-Signing Arrangement as Seller may reasonably request, the Seller Compensation Committee will promptly, and in any event before the Expiration Date, consider such Post-Signing Arrangement at a meeting duly called and held. In the event that, following such consideration, the Seller Compensation Committee believes in good faith that such Post-Signing Arrangement constitutes a Seller Compensation Arrangement, at such meeting the Seller Compensation Committee shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve such plan, program, or agreement as an Approved Seller Compensation Arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, payment, benefit, or agreement. 

   

 (c) At the time of any action by the Seller Compensation Committee described in this _Section 7.10_, each member of the Seller Compensation Committee shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act. 

  

  

 7.11 _ _ _Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover Laws or regulations enacted under state or federal Laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to Seller, the Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger, the Contribution Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby, then the Seller Board shall take all action necessary to render such statute inapplicable to the foregoing. 

       

                                    

    

 7.12 _ _ _Notification of Certain Litigation_. Seller shall notify Parent within twenty-four (24) hours if and after it receives notice of any claims, investigations or Proceedings instituted or threatened against Seller or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, including by any Seller Stockholder, before any court or Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in connection with such transactions. Seller shall consult with Parent regarding the defense or settlement of any such claims, investigations or Proceedings and shall consider Parent\'s views with respect thereto. 

  

 7.13 _ _ _Credit Facility Cooperation_. 

  

  

 (a) Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries to, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and the Seller Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent and Purchaser such cooperation as may be customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the syndication of the Amended Credit Facility, including by assisting in preparations for, and participating upon reasonable advance notice in, a reasonable number of meetings and calls with prospective lenders and financial institutions who may participate in such syndication. 

  

 (b) Seller hereby consents to the use of its and the Seller Subsidiaries\' logos in connection with the marketing or syndication of the Amended Credit Facility; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries. 

  

  

 7.14 _ _ _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Acceptance Time (including after the Effective Time) any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.

If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

defense that a remedy at law would be adequate in any action for specific
performance. If any party brings any Proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during
which such Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (ii)

 (iii) seeking to impose any material limitation on the ability of Seller, Parent or Purchaser to conduct the business or own the assets of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries or (to the extent it relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger) of Parent or any of its Affiliates; 

   

 (iv) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to acquire or hold, or to exercise full rights of ownership of any Shares, including the right to vote such shares on all matters properly presented to the Seller Stockholders; or

 (f) the representations and warranties of Seller, other than those listed in clause (d) or clause (e) above, contained in the Agreement shall not be true and correct (i) as of the date of the Agreement except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or time) and (ii) as of the Expiration Date without giving effect to the words "materially" or "material" or to any qualification based on the defined term "Seller Material Adverse Effect" except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or time), in each case, except where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect;

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed.

 Intentionally omitted. 

  

      Article VI

  

 6.1 The board of directors may make, amend, or repeal the by-laws in whole or in part, except with respect to any provision thereof which by virtue of an express provision in Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts General Laws, the articles of organization or the by-laws requires action by the shareholders. 

  

 6.2 The number of authorized shares of any class or series, the distinguishing designation thereof and the preferences, limitations and relative rights applicable thereto shall be set forth in the articles of organization or any amendment thereto approved by the board of directors. All or a specified number of directors may be elected by the holders of one or more authorized classes or series of shares, as set forth in an amendment to these articles of organization. At any time after the initial issuance of shares of any class or series, the board of directors may reclassify any unissued shares of the class or series into one or more existing or new classes or series. Shares of any class or series may be issued as a share dividend in respect of shares of another class or series. 

  

 6.3 Action required or permitted by Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts General Laws to be taken at a shareholders\' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by shareholders having not fewer than the minimum number of votes necessary to take the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote on the action are present and voting. 

  

 6.4 If any provision of Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts General Laws would otherwise require the affirmative vote of more than a majority of the shares in any voting group for favorable action to be taken on a matter, favorable action may nevertheless be taken by vote of a majority of all the shares in the voting group entitled to vote on the matter. 

  

 6.5 To the maximum extent permitted by Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts General Laws, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, no director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the corporation for or with respect to any act or failure to act of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. 

        

 6.6 The number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed in or specified in accordance with the bylaws. The corporation may have fewer than three directors, notwithstanding the number of shareholders of the corporation. 

  

 6.7 The directors may specify the manner in which the accounts of the corporation shall be kept and may determine what constitutes net earnings, profits and surplus, what amounts, if any, shall be reserved for any corporate purpose, and what amounts, if any, shall be declared as dividends. Unless the board of directors otherwise specifies, the excess of the consideration for any share with par value issued by it over such par value shall be surplus. The board of directors may allocate to capital less than all of the consideration for any share without par value issued by it, in which case the balance of such consideration shall be surplus. All surplus shall be available for any corporate purpose, including the payment of dividends. 

   

 6.8 The purchase or other acquisition by the corporation of its own shares shall not be deemed a reduction of its capital. Upon any reduction of capital or shares, no shareholder shall have any right to demand any distribution from the corporation, except as and to the extent that the shareholders shall have provided at the time of authorizing such reduction.
