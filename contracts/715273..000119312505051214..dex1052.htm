surtaxes due with respect to the transfer of title, as well as the cost for
title insurance, endorsements and surveys, and any other costs specified on

by Wyndham and PAHP, LP. Notwithstanding the terms of _Schedule_ 8 and the

respect to a Hotel, and applicable to the period of time before and after
Closing, determined in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts for the
Lodging Industry, shall be allocated between Owner (or Operating Lessee) and
Transferee as provided herein (the " _Closing Date_  



 

38   _Adjustment_ "). Pursuant to such allocation, unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Owner (and Operating Lessee) shall be entitled to
all revenue and shall be responsible for all expenses for the period of time
up to but not including the date of Closing, and Transferee shall be entitled
to all revenue and shall be responsible for all expenses for the period of
time from, after and including the date of Closing. Such allocations and
adjustments shall be shown on the closing statement (with such supporting
documentation as the parties hereto may reasonably require being attached as
exhibits to the closing statements) and if such allocations and adjustments
result in a net amount payable to an Owner the cash amount payable by
Transferee and Purchaser pursuant to the relevant closing statement shall be
increased or, if such allocations and adjustments results in a net amount
payable to Transferee, Owner shall pay such sum in cash to Transferee at
Closing (it being agreed that Owner and Wyndham may use the Purchase Price to
make such payment). All prorations shall be made on the basis of the actual
number of days in the year and month in which the Closing occurs or in the
period of computation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
following items of revenue and expense shall be allocated and prorated at
Closing:



(a) Current rents under Occupancy Agreements (excluding rent under the
Operating Lease). Such rents shall be prorated as of the Closing Date on a per
diem basis and each Transferee shall receive a credit for its proportionate
share of the rent previously received by a Transferor for the month in which
the Closing Date occurs and for all rent prepaid by more than thirty (30)
days. In the event any Transferor receives any rent or other sums due under
any Occupancy Agreements attributable to the period of time from and after the
Closing Date, such Transferor shall pay over to the applicable Transferee any
such amounts upon the later to occur of the Closing or the receipt thereof.
All Advance Deposits that the applicable Transferor holds as of the Closing
Date shall be assigned and transferred to such Transferee.



(b) Real estate and personal property taxes (with maximum allowable discounts
for early or prompt payment).



(c) Revenue and expenses under the Operating Agreements, Leased Property
Agreements and Off-Site Facility Agreements to be assigned to and assumed by
Transferee. Owner, Transferee and Purchaser agree that expenses under
Operating Agreements which constitute ongoing construction, capital
improvement and other similar work shall be allocated to Owner as to work
completed prior to the Closing Date (and applicable retainage related
thereto), and shall be allocated to Transferee as to work completed from and
after the Closing Date (and applicable retainage related thereto).



(d) Utility charges (including, but not limited to, charges for phone
service, cable television, gas, water, sewer and electricity).



(e) Municipal or other governmental improvement liens and special assessments,
which shall be paid by Owner at Closing where the work has been completed, and
which shall be assumed by Transferee at Closing and paid by Transferee where
the work has been authorized or started, but not completed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such liens or assessments are payable in installments, the
amount of the installment applicable to the period which includes the Closing
Date shall be allocated in the same manner as other items of expenses herein;
and for all other installments, Owner shall be responsible for the payment of
and shall  



 

39  pay such installments relating to periods prior to the Closing Date and
Transferee shall be responsible for the payment of and shall pay such
installments relating to periods from and after the Closing Date.



(f) License and permit fees, where transferable.



(g) All other revenues and expenses of a Hotel, including, but not limited to,
such things as restaurant, bar and meeting room income and expenses and the
like.



(h) The Rooms Ledger and housekeeping costs for the date of Closing (to be
apportioned equally between Owner [or Operating Lessee] and Transferee).



(i) Such other items as are usually and customarily prorated between
purchasers and Owners of hotel properties in the area where a Hotel is
located.



Owner shall receive a credit for any prepaid expenses accruing to periods on
or after the Closing Date. Purchaser and Transferee shall receive a credit on
the appropriate closing statement for the total of (i) prepaid rents and (ii)
Advance Deposits. At Closing, Owner or Operating Lessee shall sell to
Transferee in connection with the Hotel, and Purchaser shall cause Transferee
to purchase from Owner or Operating Lessee, at face value, in addition to the
Purchase Price: (i) all petty cash funds in connection with the Hotel
guest operations at a Hotel; and (ii) the so-called "guest ledger" as
mutually approved by Purchaser and Owner or Operating Lessee for the Hotel of
guest accounts receivable payable to the Hotel as of the check out time for
the Hotel on the Closing Date (based on guests and customers then using the
Hotel) both (1) in occupancy from the preceding night through check out time
the morning of the Closing Date, and (2) previously in occupancy prior to
check out time on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, transfer
or sale at face value shall have the following meanings: (i) for petty cash,
an amount equal to the total of all petty cash funds on hand and transferred
to Transferee; and (ii) for the guest ledger, the total of all credit card
accounts receivable as shown on the records of the Hotel, less actual
collection costs (i.e., fees retained by credit card companies), less
accounting charges for rooms furnished on a gratuity or complimentary basis to
any hotel staff or as an accommodation to other parties and less Transferees
one-half (1/2) share of the Rooms Ledger. The purchase price of said petty
cash fund and guest ledger shall be paid to Owner and Operating Lessee at
Closing by a credit to Owner in the computation of the adjustments and
prorations on the Closing Date.



Subject to the provisions hereof, all unpaid accounts payable and expenses
relating to operations of the Hotels prior to the Closing shall be paid by
each Owner, and there shall be no proration or decrease in the amount to be
funded into Title Company as a result thereof. Purchaser alone shall be
responsible for all accounts payable related to Personal Property, Inventory,
Operating Agreements, or otherwise to the extent not yet delivered, or
services, to the extent not yet rendered, as of the Closing, providing the
same are incurred in the ordinary course of business, and such Personal
Property, Inventory, Operating Agreements or other items are delivered and/or
such services rendered, after the Closing. In addition to the foregoing, all
accounts payable and expenses relating to operations of the Hotel after
Closing will be paid by Purchaser.



 

40 With respect to all Hotel Employees and such Executive Employees as are
retained or rehired by Transferee or its manager on or after the Closing, at
the option of Owner (i) Owner, Operating Lessee or Manager shall pay or cause
to be paid on or before the Closing Date, or (ii) Summerfield as replacement
manager shall assume the obligation to pay and Purchaser shall receive a
corresponding credit on the appropriate closing statement (the " _Employee
Adjustments_ ") for, all costs and expenses associated with accrued but unpaid
salary, wages and bonuses, accrued but unpaid profit sharing and pension,
health and welfare benefits, accrued but unpaid fringe benefits, accrued but
unpaid employee severance payments, and other accrued but unpaid compensation
and fringe benefits, (including accrued but unpaid sick leave and vacation
pay), in each case as of the Closing Date and to the extent that Transferee
has an obligation or liability for such expenses on or following the Closing
Date.



Owner and Operating Lessee shall be required to pay or cause to be paid all
retail sales (as distinguished from any tax on the sale of any personal
property effected pursuant to this Agreement), occupancy and liquor taxes and
like impositions up to but not including the date of Closing. Any such taxes
applicable to the Rooms Ledger shall be apportioned equally between Owner (or
Operating Lessee) and Transferee.



If accurate allocations cannot be made at Closing because current bills are
not obtainable (as, for example, in the case of utility bills and/or real
estate or personal property taxes), the parties shall allocate such revenue or
expenses at Closing on the best available information, subject to adjustment
upon receipt of the final bill or other evidence of the applicable revenue or
expense. The obligation to make the adjustment shall survive the closing of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Any revenue received or
expense incurred by Owner or Operating Lessee or by Transferee with respect to
a Hotel after the date of Closing shall be promptly allocated in the manner
described herein and the parties shall promptly pay or reimburse any amount
due. If Owner and Purchaser are unable to agree on the closing statement
allocations on the Closing Date, the Closing shall occur and a preliminary
closing statement shall be signed with respect to such amounts and issues that
are agreed upon by Owner and Purchaser. With respect to any closing statement
amounts or issues that are not agreed upon at Closing, Owner, Transferee and
Purchaser shall thereafter work in good faith to resolve, allocate or prorate
such amounts or issues; provided that if such amounts or issues are not fully
agreed upon and paid within ten (10) days after the Closing, then, in such
event, such amounts or issues shall be submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers or
another independent certified public accountant with a hospitality practice
reasonably acceptable to Owner and Purchaser, for final resolution, and Owner,
Transferee and Purchaser agree to be bound by the determination of such
accountant. The costs and expenses incurred in connection with the services
of such accountant shall be borne and paid equally by Purchaser and Owner. The
provisions of this _Section 7.6_ shall survive the Closing.



If there be any tax certiorari proceedings or tax protest proceedings pending
with respect to the Hotels, then after deducting the cost of such proceedings
including attorneys fees, all benefits obtained including, without
limitation, any tax refunds attributable to (i) any tax year ended prior to
the Closing Date shall be the property of and shall be paid to Owner, (ii) any
tax year commencing after the Closing Date shall be retained by Transferee
and (iii) the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be the property
of and shall be paid to Owner subject to apportionment between Owner and
Transferee as of the Closing Date. Owner reserves the right  



 

41  to prosecute any such proceedings for the tax year in which the Closing Date
occurs and any preceding tax years by attorneys selected by Owner and to
settle any such proceedings without the consent of Purchaser or Transferee.
If requested by Owner, Transferee shall join as a party plaintiff in any such
proceedings (at no cost to Purchaser or Transferee, except to extent that
Transferee receives any benefits from such proceedings) and both Owner and
Transferee shall be represented by Owner s attorney in such proceedings.
Transferee shall deliver to Owner, upon demand, receipted tax bills and
cancelled checks used in payment of such taxes and shall execute any and all
consents or other documents and do any act or thing necessary for the
collection of such refund by Owner. If a Transferee receives any benefits to
which Owner shall be entitled under this paragraph, such Transferee shall
hold the same in trust for the benefit of Owner and promptly remit the same to
Owner. If an Owner receives any benefits to which Transferee shall be entitled
under this paragraph, such Owner shall hold the same in trust for the benefit
of Transferee and promptly remit the same to Transferee.



Any amount due and owing Owner before the Closing by tenants under the
Occupancy Agreements which are unpaid as of the Closing, are collectively
herein called "Delinquent Amounts." Rental and other payments received by
Transferee or Owner from tenants shall be first applied toward the actual
out-of-pocket costs of collection paid by Transferee if any, then toward the
payment of rent and other charges owed to Transferee for the month in which
the payment is received, then toward the payment of rent and other charges
owed for the month in which the Closing occurs, in which case such payment
shall be prorated to the Closing, then toward any Delinquent Amounts.
Transferee may not waive any Delinquent Amounts nor modify an Occupancy
Agreement so as to reduce amounts or charges owed under the Occupancy
Agreements for any period in which Owner is entitled to receive a share of
charges or amounts, without first obtaining Owners written consent. During
the first twelve (12) months after the Closing, Owner shall have and reserves
the right to pursue any remedy against any tenant owing Delinquent Amounts
provided that (i) Owner shall notify Transferee of its intent to institute any
legal proceeding relating thereto not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
institution thereof, (ii) Owner shall not institute any legal proceedings for
collection of Delinquent Amounts prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days
following the Closing, (iii) Owner shall in no event institute any proceeding
to evict or dispossess a tenant from the Hotel and (iv) Owner shall not take
any action which would limit Transferees rights to pursue any remedy
Transferee may have for any other default under any Occupancy Lease.
Transferee may, by written notice to Owner within twenty (20) days of receipt
of Owners notice, restrict Owner from collecting such Delinquent Amounts, but
only if Transferee first pays Owner such Delinquent Amounts in exchange for
Owners assignment to Transferee of all of Owners rights and causes of action
with respect thereto. With respect to Delinquent Amounts owed by tenants who
are no longer tenants of the Hotels as of the Closing, Owner shall retain all
rights relating thereto.



Beginning no later than three (3) business days before the Closing Date, each
Owner and Purchaser shall cooperate to prepare and provide to Title Company a
preliminary statement of the prorated and adjusted items set forth above with
respect to each Hotel.



Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all payments to be
made under the LEFTA Settlement Documents shall be payable to Wyndham or its
designee. The foregoing provision shall survive Closing.



 

42 7.7 _Safe Deposit Boxes_. On the Closing Date, Owner shall cause Operating
Lessee to cause Manager to make available to Purchaser at each Hotel all
receipts and agreements in Managers possession relating to all safe deposit
boxes in use at each Hotel, other than safes or lockboxes, if any, located
inside individual guest rooms in each Hotel. Until five (5) calendar days
after the Closing Date, each Transferor shall retain all keys to each safe
deposit box at the applicable Hotel, all receipts, agreements or other written
documents relating to such safe deposit boxes and a complete list of such
safe deposit boxes identifying the name and room number of each depositor. On
the Closing Date, each Transferor shall send written notices to all hotel
guests who have reserved safe deposit boxes advising them of the sale of the
Hotel to Transferee and the procedure to be followed pursuant to this
Agreement and requesting removal and verification of the contents thereof
within five (5) calendar days after the Closing Date. All such removals and
verifications during the five (5) day period shall be under the supervision
and control of a representative or representatives to be agreed upon by the
parties hereto. Safe deposit boxes of guests who have not responded to such
written notice by so removing and verifying the contents thereof shall be
removed by the applicable Transferor and listed on a separate sheet at the end
of the five (5) day period and signed jointly by the representatives of the
applicable Transferor and Transferee effective as of the Closing Date. The
applicable Transferor will remain solely responsible after the expiration of
such five (5) day period for any missing items that guests subsequently claim
were in the safe deposit boxes prior to the Closing Date and the Wyndham
Parties hereby agree to indemnify and hold the transferees harmless from and
against all claims, demands, suits, liability or judgments, including costs
and attorney fees, in connection therewith. Each Transferee shall be solely
responsible from and after the Closing Date for the verified contents of all
such boxes, and such Transferee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the
applicable Transferor harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
suits, liability or judgments, including costs and reasonable attorneys
fees, in connection therewith. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall
survive the Closing.



7.8 _Inventory of Baggage_. The representatives of Owner, Operating Lessee
and/or Manager, and of Purchaser shall prepare an inventory of baggage at the
Hotel as of 12:00 noon on the Closing Date (which inventory of baggage shall
be binding on all parties thereto) of (i) all luggage, valises and trunks
checked or left in the care of the Hotel by guests then or formerly in the
Hotel, (ii) parcels, laundry, valet packages and other property of guests
checked or left in the care of the Hotel by guests then or formerly in the
Hotel (excluding, however, property in Hotel safe deposit boxes), (iii) all
luggage or other property of guests retained by Owner as security for any
unpaid accounts receivable, and (iv) all items contained in the Hotel lost and
found. Purchaser and Transferee shall be responsible from and after the
Closing Date for all baggage and other items listed in such inventory of
baggage, and Purchaser and Transferee shall indemnify and hold Owner,
Operating Lessee, Manager and any Affiliate thereof harmless from and against
any claim, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by them with respect thereto. The Wyndham Parties hereby agree
to indemnify and hold Purchaser and Transferee harmless from any other
liability or claims with respect to such inventory of baggage arising prior to
the Closing Date. In addition, the Transferors shall be responsible for (i)
baggage and property not listed in such inventory but alleged to have been
left in custody at the applicable Hotel with respect to the period up to but
not including the Closing Date and (ii) the contents of the baggage, and the
Wyndham Parties hereby agree to indemnify and hold the applicable Transferee
harmless from and against all claims, demands, suits, liability  



 

43  or judgments, including costs and attorney fees, in connection therewith.
The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ shall survive the Closing.



7.9 _Acquisition and Payment for Inventory_. Owner agrees to sell
to Transferee and Purchaser agrees to cause Transferee to purchase from Owner
the Inventory as part of the Purchase Price. The parties hereto shall jointly
take inventories of all Inventory as near as practical to the Closing Date.



7.10 _Assumption_. At Closing, Purchaser shall cause Transferee to assume all
(i) obligations which Purchaser or Transferee expressly assumes under this
Agreement, (ii) Advance Bookings, (iii) liabilities for which Purchaser or
Transferee receives a credit on the closing statement or pursuant to any post-
closing adjustments, and (iv) obligations under Permitted Title Exceptions
which accrue to the period from and after the Closing Date, or which accrue to
the period prior to the Closing Date and for which Purchaser or Transferee
receives a credit on the closing statement or pursuant to any post-closing
adjustments. The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ shall survive the Closing.



7.11 _Escrow Agreement_. At Closing, the Wyndham Parties shall deposit with
Title Company a sum equal to $500,000.00 (the "Escrowed Funds") to be held
and disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the performance of
certain retaining wall repairs described therein. Wyndham and the applicable
Owners agree to perform following Closing, in a commercially reasonable
manner, the work described on _Schedule 7_ attached hereto. Notwithstanding
anything herein or any of the Closing Documents to the contrary, the parties
hereby agree that the Wyndham Parties are not transferring and the Transferees
are not assuming any of the Operating Agreements related to the work to be
performed by the Wyndham Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.11_ or the
agreements described on _Schedule 25_ attached hereto. The provisions of this
_Section 7.11_ shall survive the Closing.



ARTICLE VIII

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_



8.1 _Broker_. The parties acknowledge that there is no real estate agent,
broker or finder involved in this transaction. Purchaser warrants
and represents to Transferors that Purchaser has not dealt with any real
estate agent, broker or finder in connection with this transaction, nor has
Purchaser been introduced to the Summerfield Interests or to Transferors by
any other real estate broker, and Purchaser shall indemnify Transferors and
hold Transferors harmless from and against any claims, suits, demands or
liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever arising on account of the claim
of any other person, firm or corporation to a real estate brokerage
commission or a finders fee as a result of having dealt with Purchaser, or as
a result of having introduced Purchaser to Transferors or to the Summerfield
Interests. In like manner, the Wyndham Parties warrant and represent to
Purchaser that the Wyndham Parties have not dealt with any real estate agent,
broker or finder in connection with this transaction, nor have the Wyndham
Parties been introduced to Purchaser by any other real estate agent, broker
or finder, and the Wyndham Parties shall indemnify Purchaser and save and
hold Purchaser harmless from and against any claims, suits, demands or
liabilities of any kind or nature  



 

44  whatsoever arising on account of the claim of any person, firm or
corporation to a real estate brokerage commission or a finders fee as a
result of having dealt with the Wyndham Parties in connection with this
transaction or as a result of having introduced the Wyndham Parties to
Purchaser. The provisions of this _Section 8.1_ shall survive the Closing and
any termination of this Agreement.



8.2 _Bulk Sale and Tax Clearance Certificates_. Transferors and Purchaser
acknowledge that they do not intend to comply with and have agreed to waive
the provisions of any statutory bulk sale or similar requirements applicable
to the transaction to be effected by this Agreement, nor shall any sale and
occupancy or similar tax clearance certificates shall be obtained in
connection with the Closing, and in both cases, Transferors and Purchaser
agree to rely upon the adjustment and indemnification provisions of this
Agreement to address any matters that would otherwise be subject to such bulk
sale or other requirements or provided for in such tax clearance certificates.



8.3 _Confidentiality_. Except as hereinafter provided, Purchaser, and the
Wyndham Parties and their respective Affiliates shall keep the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement confidential. None of
Lehman Brothers Real Estate, Purchaser, and the Wyndham Parties and their
respective Affiliates shall make any public announcements of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement unless Wyndham and Lehman Brothers Real Estate
first reasonably approves of same in writing, nor shall any of them disclose
the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, except to persons who,
in the reasonable business judgment of Purchaser, or the Wyndham Parties or
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, "need to know" for the purpose of
evaluating or effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
who are instructed to keep such information confidential, such as their
respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants, engineers,
surveyors, consultants, financiers, partners, investors, potential lessees and
bankers and such other third parties whose assistance is required
in connection with the consummation of this transaction (collectively, "
_Representatives_ "); provided, however, that information or documents shall
not be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.3 if, not otherwise in
violation of this Section 8.3, such information or documents, (i) were or
become(s) generally available to the public, (ii) were or become(s) available
to Purchaser or its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Wyndham Parties or any of their Affiliates, or (iii) were or are
developed by Purchaser or its Affiliates without using or relying on any
information or documents otherwise covered by the provisions of this _Section
8.3_. If the Closing occurs, the parties may either make a joint press
release, or each party may make an individual press release that is mutually
and reasonably agreed to by the other party; provided, that if the parties
fail to agree on the contents of a joint press release or separate
press releases, each party may nevertheless make its own individual press
release, provided the other party shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
make, on the date of such individual press release, its own individual press
release, and copies of each such individual press release shall be delivered
to the other party prior to being made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, it is acknowledged that each of the Wyndham Parties and Purchaser
are, or are affiliates of, publicly traded companies; consequently, each of
the Wyndham Parties, Purchaser and their Affiliates shall have the absolute
and unbridled right to disclose any information regarding the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement required by law or as determined to be
necessary or appropriate by such Partys attorneys to satisfy disclosure and
reporting obligations of any of the Wyndham Parties, Purchaser or their
Affiliates. Furthermore, any of the Wyndham Parties and  



 

45  Purchaser may disclose any information related to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to a Person (the " _Acquisition Target_
") which such Wyndham Party or Purchaser or its respective Affiliates intend
to acquire or be acquired by via merger, takeover, or otherwise. The
dissemination of information shall, however, be contingent upon the execution
of a confidentiality agreement by and between such Wyndham Party or
Purchaser, as the case may be, (or its Affiliate) and the Acquisition Target.
The terms of this _Section 8.3_ shall supersede the Confidentiality Agreement,
to the extent such confidentiality agreements relate or refer, directly or
indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The provisions
of this _Section 8.3_ relating to press releases shall survive the Closing and
all the provisions of this _Section 8.3_  shall survive a termination of this
Agreement for a period of nine (9) months after such termination; provided,
however, that any liabilities or obligations of Lehman Brothers Real Estate,
Purchaser, the Wyndham Parties and their Affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries
that may have accrued or arisen under any confidentiality agreements prior to
the Closing Date shall survive such confidentiality agreements being
superceded hereby.



If Purchaser, or any of the Wyndham Parties or their Affiliates or any
of their Representatives is required by any subpoena, interrogatories,
request for production, or other legal process or by any Applicable Laws to
disclose any confidential information, the affected party, will give the other
parties prompt written notice of the requirement and will cooperate with the
other parties so that the other parties, at its expense, may seek an
appropriate protective order. In the absence of a protective order, the party
required to disclose, including any Representatives, may disclose only such
confidential information as may be necessary to avoid any penalty, sanction,
or other material adverse consequence, and the party required to disclose will
use reasonable efforts to secure confidential treatment of any confidential
information so disclosed.



Purchaser, and the Wyndham Parties and their Affiliates and their
Representatives are cautioned that United States securities laws restrict the
purchase and sale of securities by anyone who possesses non-public information
about the issue of such securities. The Wyndham Parties acknowledge that
Purchaser and its Affiliates, on behalf of their clients, actively trade in
real estate securities, and that Purchasers and its Affiliates employees may
also trade in real estate securities for their own accounts. Nothing
contained herein shall preclude Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on behalf
of their clients (other than a client on whose behalf they are considering the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement), or Purchasers or its
Affiliates employees (other than those employees involved in the proposed
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, its
underwriting or evaluation), subject to prohibitions imposed by applicable
laws relating to trading of securities while in possession of material, non-
public information, from trading in the securities of Wyndham or any of its
Affiliates. Furthermore, nothing contained herein shall preclude Purchaser or
its Affiliates, on behalf of their clients, and/or Purchasers or its
Affiliates employees from exercising, in its or their ordinary course of
business, subject to applicable laws, any rights incident to the ownership of
securities, such as (without limitation) the right to vote any such
securities as it or they determine.



The Purchaser Parties and the Wyndham Parties stipulate that the breach of the
provisions of this _Section 8.3_ by the other party or its respective
Affiliates or Representatives may cause irreparable harm to the non-breaching
party for which damages may not constitute an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
the parties agree that any attempted, threatened, or actual breach of the
provisions of this _Section 8.3_ by one party or its Affiliates
or Representatives may be  



 

46  enjoined by an appropriate court order or judgment. The parties waive any
requirement for the posting of a bond or other security as a condition to
such court order or judgment. Injunctive relief will not be the sole remedy
of the non-breaching party for a breach of the provisions of this _Section
8.3_ , and all legal and equitable remedies will continue to be available to
the non-breaching party. If the non-breaching party is the prevailing party
in any litigation relating to the breach of the provisions of this _Section
8.3_ by the other parties or their Affiliates or Representatives, the non-
breaching parties will be entitled to recover (in addition to any damages or
other relief granted) their reasonable legal fees and other expenses in
connection with such litigation.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other
agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are
bound, any and all obligations of confidentiality contained herein and
therein (the " _Confidentiality Obligations_ "), as they relate to the
transactions and events contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transaction_ "), shall not apply to the "structure or tax aspects" (as that
phrase is used in Section 1.6011-4T(b)(3) [or any successor provision] of the
Treasury Regulations [the " _Confidentiality Regulation_ "] promulgated under
Section 6011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of the
Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Obligations
nevertheless shall apply at a given time to any and all items of information
not required to be freely disclosable at such time in order for the
Transaction not to be treated as "offered under conditions of confidentiality"
within the meaning of the Confidentiality Regulation.



8.4 _Liquor Licenses_. To the extent permitted by law, Owner or Operating
Lessee shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Transferee or its designee
(each, an " _Operator_ ") all alcoholic beverage licenses necessary to operate
the restaurant, bars and lounges presently located within a Hotel (and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, to the extent
that applicable laws prohibit the transfer of any portion of Inventory
connected with the same, then the transfer of Inventory shall be appropriately
limited or reduced as necessary to comply with such applicable laws without
otherwise delaying Closing or reducing the Purchase Price, and such matters
shall in no event constitute any breach or default by Owner or any failure of
a condition hereunder). Owner (and Operating Lessee and their Affiliates) and
Transferee shall cooperate each with the other, and each shall execute or
cause to be executed such transfer forms, license applications and other
documents as may be necessary to effect such transfers and/or to permit
Transferee to obtain new alcoholic beverage licenses. If permitted under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which a Hotel is located, such parties shall
execute or cause to be executed and file all necessary transfer
forms, applications and papers with the appropriate alcoholic beverage
authorities prior to Closing, to the end that the transfer of the existing
licenses (and/or such related Inventory) or Transferees obtaining new
licenses shall take effect, if possible, on the Closing Date, simultaneously
with Closing. If not so permitted, then the parties agree each with the other
that they will promptly execute or cause to be executed all transfer forms,
applications and other documents required by the liquor authorities in order
to effect such transfer or issuance of new licenses at the earliest date in
time possible consistent with the laws of the State where a Hotel is located,
in order that all existing alcoholic beverage licenses (and/or such related
Inventory) may be transferred or new alcoholic beverage licenses issued to
Transferee or its designee at the earliest possible time. Purchaser
acknowledges that the transfer or issuance to Transferee of any alcoholic
beverage license is not a condition of Purchasers obligation to proceed to
Closing.



 

47 If such licenses cannot be obtained by Operator until after Closing, then, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, Owner covenants and agrees that
Owner and its Affiliates shall cooperate reasonably with Operator in keeping
open the bars and lounges and other liquor facilities of the Hotels between
the Closing and the time when such alcoholic beverage licenses and permits
are obtained by Operator, or a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days following the Closing Date, whichever is less, pursuant to a " _Liquor
License Agreement_ " in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit M_ (or a
modification of such form in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Owner and
Purchaser to the extent required by Applicable Law of any applicable
jurisdiction). The provisions of this _Section 8.4_ shall survive
the Closing.



8.5 _Owner s Accounts Receivable_. It is expressly agreed by and between
Purchaser and Owner that Owner is not hereby agreeing to sell or convey or
cause to be sold or conveyed to Purchaser or Transferee, and Purchaser is not
hereby agreeing to purchase any of Owners or Operating Lessees accounts
receivable, except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.6_ above. Subject to
the preceding sentence, all of Owners and Operating Lessees accounts
receivable shall be and remain the property of Owner and Operating Lessee
subsequent to the Closing of the transaction contemplated hereby. Purchaser
and Transferee shall hold any funds received by Purchaser as payment of such
accounts receivable in trust, if Purchaser actually collects any such
amounts, and shall pay the monies collected in respect thereof to Owner and
Operating Lessee at the end of each calendar month, accompanied by a statement
showing the amount collected on each such account. Purchaser shall cause
Transferee to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect Owners and
Operating Lessees accounts receivable, but shall not be required to take any
legal proceeding or action to effect collection on behalf of Owner or
Operating Lessee, provided, however, that no Transferee shall be obligated to
any Owner in any way for the collection of such accounts other than for the
actual accounting and remittance to such Owner of the money actually received
from such accounts receivable subsequent to the Closing Date. The provisions
of this _Section 8.5_ shall survive the Closing.



ARTICLE IX

_DEFAULT; TERMINATION RIGHTS_



9.1 _Costs and Attorneys  Fees_. In the event of any litigation or dispute
between the parties arising out of or in any way connected with this
Agreement, resulting in any litigation, then the prevailing party in such
litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs of prosecuting and/or
defending same, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees at
trial and all appellate levels. The provisions of this Section 9.1 shall
survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.



9.2 _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the liability of each party hereto resulting from the breach
or default by such party shall be limited to direct actual damages incurred
by the injured party and each party hereto hereby waives its rights to recover
from the other party consequential, punitive, and exemplary damages. The
provisions of this  _Section 9.2_ shall survive the Closing or any
termination of this Agreement.



9.3 _Other Remedies_. Any claim for any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty made or contained (or deemed contained) in _Article
III_ of this Agreement, shall survive Closing indefinitely as to the
representations and warranties made or contained (or deemed  



 

48  contained) in _Section 3.1A_ , _Section 3.2A,_ _Section 3.3A, Section 3.20A,
Section 3.1B, Section 3.2B, Section 3.5B, and Section 3.23B_  hereof, or
shall survive Closing for one (1) year as to all other representations and
warranties made and contained (or deemed contained) in _Article III_ of this
Agreement, after which such representations and warranties shall merge into
the Closing Documents (collectively, the " _Surviving Representations_ "),
except for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained (or deemed contained) in _Article III_ of this Agreement of which
Purchaser has knowledge as of the Closing Date, which breach or inaccuracy
shall be deemed waived. Any claim arising out of a default in the performance
by any of the Wyndham Parties of any of its or their obligations under this
Agreement to be performed on or prior to Closing shall survive Closing for
one (1) year, after which such obligations shall merge into the Closing
Documents (a " _Surviving Covenant_ "), except for any default in the
performance by any of the Wyndham Parties of any of its or their obligations
under this Agreement to be performed on or prior to Closing of which Purchaser
has knowledge as of the Closing Date, which default shall be deemed waived.
Covenants which by their terms are performable following Closing shall not be
subject to the terms of this _Section 9.3_.



Any claim (a " _Survival Claim_ ") arising out of (i) a breach of a Surviving
Representation (other than for the representations and warranties made in
_Section 3.1A_ , _Section 3.2A,_ _Section 3.3A, Section 3.20A, Section 3.1B,
Section 3.2B, Section 3.5B, and Section 3.23B_ hereof), or (ii) a default of a
Surviving Covenant, shall be forever barred unless the applicable Purchaser
Party, as its sole and exclusive remedy for a Survival Claim, (a) no
later than ninety (91) days following the expiration of such one (1) year
survival period delivers to Wyndham a written notice of the Survival Claim
setting forth the basis for such Survival Claim (including copies of any
summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been serviced on it and
any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting same), and (b) if the Survival Claim has not been paid or settled,
then no later than two (2) years and one (1) day following the Closing Date,
files a complaint or petition against any of the Wyndham Parties alleging such
Survival Claim in an appropriate Federal district or state court in Dallas
County, Texas or New York County, New York. The Wyndham Parties and their
Affiliates shall have no liability for any individual Survival Claim or series
of substantially related Survival Claims with respect to any Summerfield
Interest (and each such Survival Claim or series of substantially related
Survival Claims shall be disregarded hereunder) that Purchaser and/or any
Purchaser Party may have at any time against any of the Wyndham Parties and
their Affiliates if the actual damages suffered by Purchaser and/or any
Purchaser Party from such individual Survival Claim or series of
substantially related Survival Claims does not exceed $50,000.00. Further, the
Wyndham Parties and their Affiliates shall have no liability for any Survival
Claim for a breach of Surviving Representation or a default under a Surviving
Covenant that is not disregarded pursuant to the preceding sentence unless the
aggregate of all actual damages suffered by Purchaser and/or any Purchaser
Party for all Survival Claims for a breach of Surviving Representation or
a default under a Surviving Covenant (that are not disregarded because they
each exceed $50,000.00) exceeds $1,000,000.00. The Wyndham Parties and their
Affiliates aggregate liability for any actual damages suffered by Purchaser
and/or any Purchaser Party for any Surviving Claims(s) including for all
Surviving Representations and all Surviving Covenants (that are not
disregarded because they each exceed $50,000.00) shall in no event exceed
$5,000,000.00 in the aggregate (without deduction for the first $1,000,000.00
of such damages for breaches of any Surviving Representations or Surviving
Covenants, which shall be  



 

49  borne by Purchaser and/or Purchaser Parties (and for which the Wyndham
Parties and their Affiliates shall not have liability)).



The provisions of this _Section 9.3_ shall survive the Closing. 



9.4 _Indemnities_. __Except for obligations expressly assumed or agreed to be
assumed by Purchaser, Transferee and/or their respective Affiliates hereunder
or in any documents delivered pursuant to _Sections 7.3 or 7.4_ hereof,
neither Purchaser or Transferee nor any Affiliate of Purchaser or Transferee
is assuming any obligations to third parties of Wyndham Parties, nor any
liability to third parties for claims arising out of any act, omission or
occurrence which is attributable to periods prior to the Closing Date
(other than as to the physical or environmental condition of the Hotels
existing on the Closing Date), and Wyndham Parties shall jointly and severally
defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser, Transferee, Purchasers Operating
Lessees and/or their respective Affiliates harmless from and against any and
all claims, costs, penalties, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") that may
at any time be incurred by any of them to any third party with respect to any
Hotel to the extent as a result of (1) obligations of Wyndham Parties which
are attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date and which are not
expressly assumed or agreed to be assumed by Purchaser, Transferee and/or
their respective Affiliates hereunder (other than as to claims of or Damages
to a Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or relating to
the physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to the
Closing Date and other than as to and excluding liabilities or claims for
remediation pertaining to the physical or environmental condition of the
Hotels prior to the Closing Date), (2) liability or claims arising out of any
acts, omissions or occurrences (other than as to and excluding liabilities to
or claims of a Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or
relating to the physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels
prior to the Closing Date and other than as to and excluding liabilities or
claims for remediation pertaining to the physical or environmental condition
of the Hotels prior to the Closing Date), which are attributable to the period
prior to the Closing Date, and which are not expressly assumed or agreed to

hereunder or (3) the failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with
any of the requirements of the bulk transfer provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code in effect in the states in which the Hotels are situated
(other than as to and excluding claims, liabilities, duties or obligations of
or to a Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or relating to
the physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to the
Closing Date and other than as to and excluding claims or Damages for or
pertaining to remediation of the physical or environmental condition of the
Hotels prior to the Closing Date). The Wyndham Parties shall jointly and
severally assume, defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser No. 1 and the

time be incurred by any of them to the extent of, obligations of the
Summerfield Entities which are attributable to the period prior to the Closing
Date (other than as to and excluding liabilities to or claims of a
Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or relating to the
physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to the
Closing Date and other than as to and excluding liabilities or claims for
remediation pertaining to the physical or environmental condition of the

severally defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser No. 1 and the Summerfield
Entities harmless from and against any Damages that may at any time be
incurred by any of them to the extent of obligations of SFMB which
are attributable to (x) any of the  



 

50  agreements set forth on _Schedule 2_ attached hereto and the liquor licenses
related thereto, regardless of whether they arise prior to or after
the Closing Date or (y) any other liabilities or agreements of SFMB existing
prior to the Closing Date; provided however in no event shall the Wyndham
Parties have liability for obligations assumed or created from and after the
Closing Date. Wyndham, by way of subrogation from SFMB, shall have the right
to pursue any indemnity provisions contained in the agreements described on
_Schedule 2_ to recover any payments made pursuant to the foregoing indemnity
and Purchaser shall execute and cause its Affiliates to execute any documents
required to permit Wyndham to pursue such subrogation rights.



Purchaser and Transferees shall jointly and severally defend, indemnify and
hold the Wyndham Parties and their Affiliates harmless from and against
any and all Damages that may at any time be incurred by any of them to any
third party to the extent as a result of (1) obligations of Purchaser,
Transferee and their respective Affiliates which are attributable to the
period from and after the Closing Date (except as to claims of or Damages to
a Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or relating to the
physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to the
Closing Date and except as to claims or Damages for or pertaining to
remediation of the physical or environmental condition of the Hotels existing

Purchaser, Transferee and/or their respective Affiliates hereunder), (2)
liability or claims arising out of any acts, omissions or occurrences which
are attributable to the period from and after the Closing Date, in each case
in connection with the Hotels (except as to liabilities to or claims of a
Governmental Authority arising out of or resulting from or relating to the
physical condition or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to the
Closing Date and except as to claims or Damages for or pertaining to
remediation of the physical or environmental condition of the Hotels prior to
the Closing Date, unless expressly assumed or agreed to be assumed by
Purchaser or its Affiliates hereunder), (3) any Damages or any lien or claim
therefor, to the extent arising from any tests and investigations conducted by
any Purchaser Party prior to Closing or other acts or omissions on or about
the Hotels by Purchaser or any Purchaser Parties prior to Closing, but
excluding any such loss, liability, personal injury or death, damage, cost or
expense if and to the extent caused solely by the negligence or willful
misconduct of Wyndham or Transferor or their respective Affiliates or (4)
obligations which are expressly assumed or agreed to be assumed by Purchaser,
Transferee and/or their respective Affiliates hereunder.



Wyndham Parties shall also jointly and severally defend, indemnify and hold
Purchaser and Summerfield Real Estate Company No. 2 harmless from and against
Damages that may be incurred by them with respect to the existence of any
matter or matters which results in the Title Company validly and rightfully
denying liability under the Title Policy issued by the Title Company on the
Miami Summerfield on the ground that, at the date of the Title Policy,
knowledge of such matter or matters is imputed to Summerfield Real Estate
Company No. 2 or Purchaser from PAHP by operation of law (as opposed to
actual knowledge of Purchaser). Such Damages shall be limited to the type and
shall not exceed the amount which the Title Company would have liability to
pay to Summerfield Real Estate Company No. 2 but is not obligated to pay
solely on account of knowledge of such matter or matters being validly and
rightfully imputed to Summerfield Real Estate Company No. 2 or Purchaser from
PAHP.



 

51 Upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to a claim for indemnification
(an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") under any provision of this Agreement or any
Closing Document, the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_
") shall promptly notify the other party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of
such Indemnification Claim and provide the Indemnitor with copies of any
documents describing or otherwise bearing on the subject matter of such
indemnification obligation; provided, however, that the failure to notify
Indemnitor shall not relieve Indemnitor from any liability which Indemnitor
may have under the Indemnification Claim except to the extent that it has been
materially prejudiced by such failure. Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in
respect of the Indemnification Claim and, to the extent that it wishes, assume
the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. After notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such claim, action, suit or proceeding,
Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof except as provided in the following sentence. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by
the Indemnitor in writing, or (ii) there is, in the reasonable opinion of
independent counsel, a conflict concerning any material issue between the
position of the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party, in which case if the
Indemnified Party notifies Indemnitor in writing that it elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of Indemnitor, then Indemnitor shall not have
the right to assume the defense of the claim, action, suit or proceeding on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, but in such event the Indemnitor shall not be
required to pay the charges and expenses of counsel other than (i) counsel
retained by Indemnitor to assume the defense of one or more Indemnified
Parties and (ii) one separate counsel retained by all other Indemnified
Parties. Nothing set forth herein is intended to or shall impair the right of
any Indemnified Party to retain separate counsel at its own expense. If the
Indemnitor does not elect to engage attorneys or other persons to defend
against such claim, action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitor shall pay the
reasonable charges and expenses of such attorneys and other persons as are
engaged by the Indemnified Party on a current basis within thirty (30) days
after submission of invoices or bills therefor, provided that the Indemnified
Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnitor the amount of any such charges
and expenses if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party was not
entitled to be indemnified in connection with such matter. The Indemnitor will
not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of the
Indemnification Claim unless, (i) Indemnitor shall have given the Indemnified
Party reasonable prior written notice thereof and shall have obtained an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding, or (ii) Indemnitor reaffirms in writing its indemnity
obligations hereunder regardless of Applicable Laws to the contrary. As long
as Indemnitor has complied with its obligations to defend and indemnify,
Indemnitor shall not be liable for any settlement made by the Indemnified
Party without the consent of Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



The provisions of this _Section 9.4_ shall survive the Closing and, only as
to any indemnification obligation under this Agreement which survives a
termination of this Agreement,  



 

52  any termination of this Agreement. Claims pursuant to the foregoing
indemnity shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
9.3_.
