HoldCo will subscribe for a number of common shares of QLT that is equal to the number of Auxilium Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio for a purchase price in cash equal to the Subscription Price.  


(c)

 On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, on the Closing Date, AcquireCo shall be merged with and into Auxilium. At the Merger Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of AcquireCo shall cease and Auxilium shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company").  


(d)

 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties to the Merger shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of Merger, executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in 
 

      

   

connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as QLT and Auxilium shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. At and immediately after the
Merger Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the
Certificate of Merger and the DGCL.

   

 (e)

 The certificate of incorporation of AcquireCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The by-laws of AcquireCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.  


(f)

 The directors of the Surviving Company upon completion of the Merger shall, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly appointed, elected and qualified, as the case may be, consist of individuals designated by the Auxilium Board of Directors prior to the Merger Effective Time. The officers of Auxilium immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.  


(g)

 At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any of their respective shareholders:  

 

 (i)

 Each share of common stock of AcquireCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and all rights in respect thereof, shall forthwith be cancelled and cease to exist and be converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of redeemable preferred stock of the Surviving Company, such redeemable preferred stock to have an aggregate redemption amount and fair market value equal to the fair market value of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AcquireCo immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time.  


(ii)

 Each Auxilium Share that is owned by Auxilium as treasury stock and each Auxilium Share that is owned directly by Auxilium immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  


(iii)

 Subject to Section 2.1(k), each Auxilium Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive such number of QLT Shares as is equal to the Equity Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration") from HoldCo, on behalf of AcquireCo. All such Auxilium Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented any such Auxilium Share (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, the outstanding QLT Shares or Auxilium Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of QLT Shares or Auxilium Shares, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Auxilium and the holders of Auxilium Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 
 

 

      

  

 (iv)

 The Surviving Company, as successor to AcquireCo, shall issue such number of shares of common stock to HoldCo equal to the number of Auxilium Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio in consideration for HoldCo delivering (on behalf of AcquireCo) common shares of QLT to the former Auxilium Stockholders.  


  

 (h)

 Subject to compliance with all applicable Laws and the receipt of all required consents, the Parties will take such commercially reasonable steps so as to restructure the terms of each Auxilium Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger to reflect the fact that after giving effect to the terms of this Agreement, QLT will become the holding company of the Combined Group.  


(i)

 Subject to compliance with all applicable Laws and the receipt of all required consents, the Parties will take such actions as are required under the terms of each Auxilium Convertible Note issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger to reflect the fact that after giving effect to the terms of this Agreement, QLT will become the holding company of the Combined Group.  


(j)

 Subject to compliance with all applicable Laws and the receipt of all required consents, the Parties will take such commercially reasonable steps so as to ensure that the Auxilium Call Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger are not terminated as a result of the Merger.  


(k)

 The exchange of Certificates shall be effected as follows:  

 

 (i)

 Prior to the Merger Effective Time, QLT shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Auxilium to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, HoldCo shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent, on behalf of itself, certificates representing the QLT Shares to be delivered as Merger Consideration (or, if uncertificated QLT Shares will be delivered, QLT shall make appropriate alternative arrangements).  


(ii)

 As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time (and in any event within four Business Days after the Merger Effective Time), QLT shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Auxilium Shares a form of letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Auxilium may specify acting reasonably, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing, together with instructions thereto).  


(iii)

 Upon (i) in the case of Auxilium Shares represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of Auxilium Shares held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the QLT Shares into which such Auxilium Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(g). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Auxilium Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Auxilium, the QLT Shares may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Auxilium 
 

 

      

    

Share (or, if such Auxilium Share is held in book-entry form, proper evidence
of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.1(k), each Auxilium Share, and any Certificate
with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that the holders of Auxilium Shares are entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.1(g).

   

 (iv)

 The QLT Shares delivered and credited as fully paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II upon conversion of any Auxilium Shares shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Auxilium Shares. From and after the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of Auxilium Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Auxilium Shares (or Auxilium Shares held in book-entry form) are presented to QLT or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.  


(v)

 Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the holders of Auxilium Shares for one year after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to QLT or its designee, and any holder of Auxilium Shares who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to QLT for its claim for QLT Shares.  


(vi)

 None of Auxilium, QLT, AcquireCo, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  


  

 (l)

 Each of QLT, HoldCo and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Auxilium Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of Auxilium Shares in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.  


(m)

 If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by QLT, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as QLT may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.  


(n)

 As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the Closing Date, the Auxilium Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents and making any required amendments to the Auxilium Share Plans) as may be required to effect and/or procure the following:  

 

 (i)

 Each Auxilium Option (that is not an ESPP Option) that as of the Merger Effective Time is outstanding, shall cease to represent an option or other right to acquire Auxilium Shares and shall be converted on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Auxilium Option (including vesting conditions, but taking into 
 

 

      

    

account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Auxilium Share
Plan, in any applicable award agreement, in such option or deemed necessary to
comply with applicable Laws (including appropriate adjustments to performance
vesting metrics, as applicable)) as of the Merger Effective Time into a stock
option to acquire a number of QLT Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of Auxilium Shares
subject to such Auxilium Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per QLT
Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price
per Auxilium Share applicable to such Auxilium Option immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Exchange Ratio;

   

 (ii)

 Each issued and outstanding Auxilium Share subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to Auxilium Share Plans immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (a "Restricted Auxilium Share") shall, as of the Merger Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire an Auxilium Share and shall be converted into the right to receive such number of QLT Shares as is equal to the number of shares subject to such Restricted Auxilium Share multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio, subject to substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting and other lapse restrictions, but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Auxilium Share Plan or in any applicable award agreement (including appropriate adjustments to performance vesting metrics, as applicable)); and  


(iii)

 Each stock-based award (including any restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards), other than an Auxilium Option or Restricted Auxilium Share ("Other Auxilium Share-Based Awards" and together with Restricted Auxilium Shares, the "Auxilium Share Awards"), granted under any Auxilium Share Plan and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Merger Effective Time, cease to represent an award based on Auxilium Shares and shall be converted into an award based on a number of QLT Shares equal to the number of Auxilium Shares covered by such Other Auxilium Share-Based Award multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio, provided that such a converted stock-based right or award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions (including the vesting conditions, but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Auxilium Share Plan, in any applicable award agreement or deemed necessary to comply with applicable Laws (including appropriate adjustments to performance vesting metrics, as applicable)).  


  

 (o)

 As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event, prior to the Closing Date, the Auxilium Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following: each Auxilium Option under Auxilium Employee Stock Purchase Program (the "ESPP") that is outstanding as of the Merger Effective Time (an "ESPP Option") shall cease to represent an option to acquire Auxilium Shares and shall be converted on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the ESPP as of the Merger Effective Time into an option to acquire a number of QLT Shares equal to the product of (i) the total number of Auxilium Shares subject to the ESPP Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at a purchase price per QLT Share equal to (i) the purchase price per Auxilium Share immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time divided by (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). 
 

      

 

 (p)

 The treatment of Auxilium Share Plans and ESPP shall be as follows:  

 

 (i)

 It is the intent of the Parties hereto that the treatment of Auxilium Share Awards and Auxilium Options contemplated herein be in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including all guidance and regulations issued thereunder.  


(ii)

 QLT shall, prior to Closing, take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of QLT Shares as is equal to the aggregate number of QLT Shares issuable after the Merger Effective Time (i) upon exercise of the Replacement Auxilium Options, (ii) in respect of each share of Replacement Auxilium Restricted Stock and Replacement Auxilium RSU, (iii) upon exercise of Auxilium Warrants and (iv) upon conversion of Auxilium Convertible Notes.  


(iii)

 As of the Merger Effective Time, QLT will assume Auxilium Share Plans, the ESPP and any other equity plans that have been approved by the board of directors and stockholders of Auxilium prior to the Merger Effective Time. As of the Merger Effective Time, QLT will be able to grant stock awards and options to purchase QLT Shares, to the extent permissible by applicable Laws and NASDAQ regulations, under the terms of Auxilium Share Plans and the ESPP and issue the reserved but unissued Auxilium Shares (including shares subject to the unexercised or unissued portions of any Auxilium Option, Auxilium Share Award or ESPP Option that expire, terminate or are canceled and shares subject to any Auxilium Option and Auxilium Share Award that are reacquired pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which such shares were issued that return to Auxilium Share Plans or the ESPP pursuant to their terms), except that (i) Auxilium Shares covered by such awards will be QLT Shares and (ii) all references to a number of Auxilium Shares will be (A) changed to reference QLT Shares and (B) converted to a number of QLT Shares equal to the applicable number of Auxilium Shares multiplied by the Equity Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of QLT Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Merger Effective Time, the board of directors of QLT (or, if appropriate, any committee administering employee, individual consultant and director compensation plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to assume Auxilium Share Plans and the ESPP or to adopt share plans having terms substantially identical to Auxilium Share Plans and the ESPP and covering the awards of QLT Shares resulting from Section 2.1(n) and options to purchase QLT Shares under the ESPP, subject to any adjustments that may be required by applicable Laws. QLT Stock Option Plan (and all QLT securities issued thereunder) and QLT DSU Plan shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.  


 

(q)

3.1 Representations and Warranties of QLT

  

 Except as disclosed in the applicable section or subsection of the QLT Disclosure Letter (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the QLT Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the QLT Disclosure Letter only to the extent the relevance of such item to such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face) or the QLT Public Disclosure Record (other than any disclosure contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" or similar captions and any other disclosure contained therein that is predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature), QLT represents and warrants to and in favour of Auxilium as follows and acknowledges that Auxilium is relying upon such representations and warranties in entering into this Agreement:

 _Organization and Qualification_. QLT has been duly incorporated, validly exists and is in good standing under the BC Act and has the requisite corporate and legal power and capacity to own its assets as now owned and to carry on its business as it is now being carried on.

which the nature or character of the respective properties and assets, owned,
leased or operated by it, or the nature of its business or activities, makes

(ii)

 QLT has designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused them to be designed under the supervision of the Chairman of the QLT Executive Transition Committee and Chief Financial Officer of QLT, to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to QLT is made known to such officers by others within QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries, particularly during the period in which the "annual filings" or "interim filings" (as defined in National Instrument 52-109) are being prepared.  


(iii)

 QLT has designed such internal controls over financial reporting, or caused them to be designed under the supervision of the Chairman of the QLT Executive Transition Committee and Chief Financial Officer of QLT, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Section 3.1(r)(i) of the QLT Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, complete and correct list of each employee benefit and compensation plan, agreement, program or arrangement, whether written or unwritten, including without limitation, any option, restricted share unit, deferred share unit, stock purchase, or other stock or stock-based incentive plan, cash bonus or incentive compensation arrangement, retirement or deferred compensation plan, profit sharing plan, unemployment or severance compensation plan or health and welfare plan, or Employment Agreement, for any current or former employee or director, to the extent the potential liability remains outstanding, of, or other service provider to, QLT or any of its Subsidiaries participates in, is a party or contributes to, or with respect to which QLT or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any liability (each, a "QLT Plan").  


(ii)

 With respect to each QLT Plan, QLT has provided or otherwise made available to Auxilium in the QLT Data Room or in the QLT Public Disclosure Record (A) a true and complete copy of each QLT Plan, including any amendments thereto and all material supporting documents; (B) latest annual report, if any; (C) copies of all material communications received in the last three years with applicable Government Authority; (D) each trust or other funding arrangement, (E) each summary plan description (if applicable) and (F) where applicable, the most recent financial statements and actuarial or other valuation reports prepared with respect thereto.  


(iii)

 The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee or officer of QLT to termination or severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, (B) accelerate the time of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise), payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefit due any such employee or officer, or (C) cause amounts payable under the Employee Plans to fail to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. No employee or individual consultant or independent contractor is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed upon such person.  


(iv)

 Each QLT Plan has been established, registered, qualified, funded, invested, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code). There are no pending, or to the knowledge of QLT, threatened actions, suits, disputes or claims by or on behalf of any QLT Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such QLT Plan, as applicable, or otherwise involving any such QLT Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).  


(v)

 No QLT Plan provides welfare or post-retirement benefits, including without limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), beyond retirement or termination of service to employees or former employees or to the beneficiaries or dependents of such employees, other than coverage mandated solely by applicable Law.  


(vi)

 No QLT Plan is governed by, and QLT has no liability under, Section 401(a) of the Code or US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Neither QLT, nor any Person that is a member of a "controlled group of corporations" with, or is under "common control" with, or is a member of the same "affiliated service group", with QLT, in each case as defined in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code sponsors, contributes to or has any liability under, and in the past six years sponsored, contributed to or had liability under, a plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. 
 

 

      

  

 (vii)

 No QLT Plan is a "registered pension plan" as defined in s. 248(1) of the Tax Act.  


(viii)

 There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by QLT or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, a QLT Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such QLT Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. There has been no termination of any material QLT Plan since January 1, 2014.  


(ix)

 All contributions, premiums or Taxes required to be made or paid by QLT or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, under or in connection with the QLT Plans have been made in a timely fashion in accordance with Laws and the terms of the applicable QLT Plan. There are no unfunded liabilities in respect of any QLT Plan and have been properly reflected in the QLT Financial Statements.

(ii)

 QLT or one of the QLT Subsidiaries owns, or has a valid right to use, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), all Intellectual Property (A) related to the products or product candidates presently used in the conduct of the business of QLT or one of the QLT Subsidiaries and (B) used or held for use in, or necessary to conduct, the business and operations of QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

(v)

 To the knowledge of QLT, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any material QLT Intellectual Property owned, used or held for use by QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries in the conduct of the business of QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries as presently conducted, and no such claims have been asserted or threatened against any Person by QLT or the QLT Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of QLT, any other Person, in the past six years.

_ADDITIONAL COVENANTS 
_

  

5.1 Access to Information; Cooperation

  

 

 (a)

 Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and Orders and the terms of any existing Contracts, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries to, afford to the other Parties and their respective Representatives, until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, continuing access to the other parties\' virtual data rooms, and reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to its businesses, properties, books and records and such other data and information as a Party may reasonably request, as well as to the other Party\'s and its Subsidiaries\' personnel, subject, however, to such access not interfering with the ordinary conduct of its businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms of any Law, Order or Contract shall limit a Party\'s right to access the information pursuant to this Section 5.1, the other Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any consents from a third party to provide such access or information or (ii) develop an alternative to providing such access or information to a Party so as to address such lack of access or information in a manner reasonably acceptable to the receiving Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing shall not require any disclosure that would reasonably be expected, as a result of such disclosure, to have the effect of causing the waiver of any privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges). Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, each of the Parties acknowledges that all information provided to it under this Section 5.1, or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the Transaction, is subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement otherwise conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will supersede those of the Non-Disclosure Agreement but only to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency and all other provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  


(b)

 Prior to Closing, QLT shall provide reasonable cooperation and shall cause its respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries and its and their representatives, including management, officers, employees, directors, legal, non-legal and accounting advisors and auditors to provide reasonable cooperation to Auxilium in obtaining any financing with respect to the Transaction (including, without limitation, any amendment required to any Auxilium Debt Instrument), including:

 (iii)

 participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and cooperating with marketing or solicitation efforts of Auxilium, in each case in connection with the arrangement of any such financing, including by consenting to the use of QLT\'s and its Subsidiaries\' logos in connection therewith; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage QLT or any of its Subsidiaries;  


(iv)

 assisting with the timely preparation of materials for rating agency and lender presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with such financing;  


(v)

 obtaining a certificate of the chief financial officer of QLT with respect to solvency matters of QLT or its Subsidiaries to the extent required by any financing source, customary authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to any financing;  


(vi)

 using reasonable commercial efforts to obtain accountants\' comfort letters and legal opinions at the expense of and as reasonably requested by Auxilium; and  


(vii)

 taking all corporate or other actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of any such financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to QLT, including assisting in the preparation of and executing one or more credit agreements (or amendments thereto), indentures, purchase agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements and other definitive documentation, certificates and related deliverables relating to any financing and reasonably facilitating the provision of guarantees, the grant (and perfection) of a security interest in collateral and provision of related lender protections. 
  

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligation of QLT or its Subsidiaries under
any such financing arrangements or other arrangements required to be
undertaken by QLT or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.1(b), shall
be effective until the Closing. None of QLT, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates shall be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with such financing prior to the Closing. Auxilium shall upon
request by QLT advance all material, reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by QLT or any QLT Subsidiary in connection with any actions
taken by QLT or a QLT Subsidiary or, promptly upon request by QLT, reimburse
QLT or the QLT Subsidiaries for all reasonable fees and expenses (including
any professional fees and expenses) and Taxes incurred by QLT and the QLT
Subsidiaries in connection with any such financing. Auxilium shall indemnify
QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for any and
all Taxes, liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with or as a result of their co-operation or assistance with or
participation in any matter under this Section 5.1(b). No director, officer,
employee or agent of QLT or any QLT Subsidiaries shall be required, in
connection with any such matter, to take any action in any capacity other than
as a director, officer, employee or agent of QLT or the QLT Subsidiaries, as
the case may be. The covenants contained in this Section 5.1(b) are intended
to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Representatives and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and
other legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights which a Representative has under Law, Contract or otherwise, and shall
be binding on Auxilium and its successors and assigns. QLT will act as agent
and trustee for each such person for the covenants of Auxilium under this

   

       

   

Section 5.1(b), and QLT agrees to accept such appointment and to hold and
enforce the obligations and covenants on behalf of each such person.

   

 (c)

 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1(b), none of QLT, the QLT Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action which would, in the opinion of QLT, acting reasonably:  

 

 (i)

 create enforceable obligations of any of QLT or its Subsidiaries under any financing arrangements, or other arrangements required to be undertaken by QLT or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 5.1(b) prior to the Closing;  


(ii)

 require QLT to obtain the approval of the QLT Shareholders (other than at the QLT Meeting);

(iv)

 require QLT or any Subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws or their respective organizational documents or breach any contract of QLT or its Subsidiaries, 
 

   

and no such action will be considered in determining whether a
representation, warranty or covenant of QLT hereunder has been breached or
whether a condition precedent to the Merger has been satisfied, it being
acknowledged by Auxilium that any such actions could require the consent of
third parties under applicable contracts of QLT or its Subsidiaries.

 Each of QLT and Auxilium shall, other than in respect of routine correspondence and dealings with the TSX and NASDAQ regarding the Transaction: (i) promptly advise each other of any written or oral communication (including communications received by their respective Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Authority or third party from whom a waiver, consent or approval is required or reasonably necessary to consummate the Transaction; (ii) not participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or enquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transaction unless it consults with the other Party in advance, and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction, except that materials may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable privilege, competitively sensitive information, or confidentiality concerns.  


(d)

 Each Party will provide as promptly as practicable such information and documentary material as may be requested by a Governmental Authority following any such filing or notification.  


(e)

 In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in this Section 5.2, but subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.2(e), each of QLT and Auxilium agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any Relevant Law with respect to the Merger, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Relevant Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, so as to enable the Merger Effective Time to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of QLT or Auxilium (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any Joint Venture held by QLT or Auxilium (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (ii) creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of QLT or Auxilium or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit Auxilium\'s or QLT\'s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of QLT or Auxilium (including any of their respective Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all waivers, consents, clearances or approvals required directly or 
 

      

   

indirectly under any Relevant Law or to avoid the commencement of any action
by a Governmental Authority to prohibit the Merger under any Relevant Law, or
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order in any
Proceeding seeking to prohibit the Merger or delay the Merger Effective Time
beyond the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require,
QLT or Auxilium (or any of their Subsidiaries) to take any action, agree to
take any action or consent to the taking of any action (including with
respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of any business or
assets or conducting its (or their Subsidiaries) business in any specified
manner) if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on either QLT or Auxilium (a
"Restraint").

 Each of QLT, Auxilium and Auxilium\'s Subsidiaries agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of the present and former directors and officers of QLT, Auxilium or of any of their respective Subsidiaries (each such present or former director or officer (i) of Auxilium being referred to as an "Auxilium Indemnified Party", and (ii) of QLT being herein referred to as a "QLT Indemnified Party" and each Auxilium Indemnified Party and QLT Indemnified Party being an "Indemnified Party" and such Persons collectively being referred to as the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the constating documents of QLT, Auxilium or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Contract by which QLT, Auxilium or any of their respective Subsidiaries is bound and which is in effect as of the date hereof, will survive the completion of the Transaction and continue in full force and effect and without modification, with respect to actions or omissions of the Indemnified Parties occurring prior to the Closing, for the period currently contemplated therein.  


(b)

 QLT, Auxilium and their respective Subsidiaries will maintain in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for seven years from the Closing Date customary policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection provided by the policies maintained by QLT, Auxilium and their respective Subsidiaries, which are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of QLT and Auxilium may, prior to the Closing Date, purchase prepaid non-cancellable run-off directors\' and officers\' liability insurance on terms substantially similar to the directors\' and officers\' liability policies currently maintained by QLT or Auxilium, as applicable, but providing coverage for a period of seven years from the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in no event shall either QLT, Auxilium or their respective Subsidiaries spend premiums for any of the insurance referenced in this Section 5.6(b) to the extent it would exceed 300% of the relevant party\'s current annual premium for directors\' and officers\' liability insurance, as applicable.

 QLT and Auxilium shall take all actions necessary so that, as of the Merger Effective Time, the board of directors of QLT shall consist of seven individuals designated by Auxilium prior to Closing and two individuals designated by QLT and acceptable to Auxilium prior to Closing. 

  

5.11 Tax Election

  

 The Parties agree that QLT (or any successor thereof) shall elect (and file such election as soon as practicable) under subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act that neither QLT nor any person not dealing at arm\'s length with QLT will deduct in computing its income for a taxation year any amount in respect of the QLT Options. 

  

5.12 Tax Representation Letters

 (a)

 QLT and Auxilium agree, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate with each other in connection with the arrangement of the Retinoid Transaction, as may reasonably be requested by either party, including participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, preparation of disclosure and similar documents. Neither QLT nor Auxilium shall (i) participate in any meeting or discussion (other than non-substantive calls) with any third party concerning a Retinoid Transaction unless it consults with the other party in advance, and gives the other party the opportunity to attend, and, to the extent that the other party determines not to attend, provide a summary of such meeting or discussion; and (ii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all material correspondence and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and any third party, on the other hand, with respect to the Retinoid Transaction.  


(b)

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:  

 

 (i)

 No agreement regarding the Retinoid Transaction that may be entered into on or before the Closing shall require the consummation of the Retinoid Transaction prior to Closing; and  


(ii)

 If Auxilium pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(xxiii) withholds its consent, for any reason, with respect to negotiations of, or entering into, a Retinoid Transaction providing for economic terms substantially no less favourable, in aggregate, to QLT (with the exception of the amount of the Retinoid Closing Payment which may be nil or less than the amount set out in Section 4.1(c)(xxiii) of the QLT Disclosure Letter) than those terms set out in Section 4.1(c)(xxiii) of the QLT Disclosure Letter, then the adjustments to the Equity Exchange Ratio set out in Section 1.1, paragraph (b) of the definition of "Equity Exchange Ratio", shall no longer apply.  


 

(c)

 Auxilium acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of a Retinoid Transaction shall not be considered in determining whether a representation, warranty or covenant of QLT hereunder has been breached or whether a condition precedent to the Merger has been satisfied, it being acknowledged by Auxilium that the consummation of a Retinoid Transaction will require the consent of third parties set forth in Section 5.13(c) of the QLT Disclosure Letter. 
 

  

5.14 Pre-Acquisition Reorganization

  

 

 (a)

 QLT agrees that, upon the reasonable request of Auxilium, QLT will and will cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to effect such reorganizations of QLT or its Subsidiaries\' business, operations and assets and the integration of other affiliated businesses of QLT as Auxilium may reasonably request (each a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization") and cooperate with Auxilium and its advisors to determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which they most effectively could be undertaken. Auxilium acknowledges and agrees that all elements of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations shall, in the opinion of QLT acting reasonably:  

 

 (i)

 not impede, delay or prevent completion of the Merger or the Retinoid Transaction or the ability of Auxilium to obtain any financing required by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
 

 

      

  

 (ii)

 be effective as close as reasonably practical to the Closing Date and, in any event, after all Regulatory Approvals are obtained;  


(iii)

 not prejudice QLT or the QLT Shareholders in any material respect;  


(iv)

 not require QLT to obtain the approval of the QLT Shareholders;  


(v)

 not unreasonably interfere in the operations of QLT or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Merger Effective Time;  


(vi)

 not be considered in determining whether a representation, warranty or covenant of QLT hereunder has been breached or whether a condition precedent to the Merger has been satisfied, it being acknowledged by Auxilium that actions taken pursuant to any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization could require the consent of third parties under applicable contracts of QLT or its subsidiaries;  


(vii)

 not require QLT or any QLT Subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws, their respective organizational documents or any contract of QLT or its Subsidiaries;  


(viii)

 not result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other consequences to, any security holder of QLT incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to such security holder in connection with the consummation of the Merger in the absence of any Pre- Acquisition Reorganization; and  


(ix)

 not become effective unless Auxilium and QLT shall have confirmed in writing that they are prepared promptly and without condition to proceed with the Merger.  


  

 (b)

 Auxilium will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice to QLT of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization as soon as possible and in any event no less than 30 days prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Section 5.14(a) and Section 5.14(c), QLT and Auxilium will, at the expense of Auxilium, work cooperatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the Merger Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. The Parties will seek to have the steps and transactions contemplated under any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made effective at such times (as directed by Auxilium) prior to or on the Closing Date prior to the Merger Effective Time, but in any event after all Regulatory Approvals are obtained (but if before the Merger Effective Time, after the Parties have waived or confirmed that all conditions referred to in Section 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 have been satisfied, and the Parties have confirmed in writing that they are prepared to promptly proceed to effect the Merger), Auxilium shall upon request by QLT advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by QLT or any QLT Subsidiaries in connection with any actions taken by QLT or any QLT Subsidiaries or, promptly upon request by QLT, reimburse QLT or the QLT Subsidiaries for all reasonable fees and expenses (including any professional fees and expenses) and Taxes incurred by QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries in connection with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and shall indemnify QLT for any costs, Taxes, loss of opportunity or otherwise of QLT and its subsidiaries in reversing or unwinding any Pre- Acquisition Reorganization that was effected prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.  


(c)

 Auxilium shall indemnify QLT and the QLT Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for any and all Taxes, liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of their co-operation or assistance with or participation in any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. No director, officer, employee or agent of QLT or any QLT Subsidiaries shall be required, in connection with a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, to take any action in any capacity other 
 

      

   

than as a director, officer, employee or agent of QLT or the QLT
Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The covenants contained in this Section 5.14
are intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Representatives and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators and other legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights which a Representative has under Law, Contract
or otherwise, and shall be binding on Auxilium and its successors and assigns.
QLT will act as agent and trustee for each such person for the covenants
of Auxilium under this Section 5.14, and QLT agrees to accept such
appointment and to hold and enforce the obligations and covenants on behalf of
each such person.

   

 (d)

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will completion of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization be a condition to completion of the Merger. 
 

 

    
ARTICLE VI 

_ACQUISITION PROPOSALS 
_

  

6.1 QLT Non-Solicitation

  

 

 (a)

 Subject to Section 6.2, until the earlier of the Closing or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, QLT shall not, and QLT shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through any other Person:  

 

 (i)

 initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing or affording access to information), or take any other action that promotes, directly or indirectly, or may reasonably cause, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a QLT Acquisition Proposal or potential QLT Acquisition Proposal;  


(ii)

 participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate, any effort or attempt by any other Person (other than Auxilium and its Affiliates) to make or complete a QLT Acquisition Proposal;  


(iii)

 effect any QLT Change of Recommendation; or  


(iv)

 accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, arrangement or undertaking constituting or related to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any QLT Acquisition Proposal (a "QLT Acquisition Agreement").  


 

(b)

 QLT shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective Representatives to, immediately upon execution of this Agreement cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with or involving any Person (other than Auxilium and its Affiliates) conducted heretofore by QLT or its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives, with respect to any QLT Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a QLT Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, QLT will immediately discontinue access by any Person (other than Auxilium and its Affiliates) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) established by QLT or its Representatives for such purpose. QLT agrees not to release any third party (other than Auxilium and its Affiliates) from any "standstill" agreement to which it is a party (it being acknowledged and agreed that (A) the automatic termination of any "standstill" or similar provisions of any agreement as the result of the entering into and announcement of this Agreement pursuant to 
 

      

   

the express terms of any such agreement shall not itself be a violation of
this Section 6.1(b); and (B) the foregoing shall not prevent the QLT Board of
Directors from considering a QLT Acquisition Proposal and accepting a QLT
Superior Proposal that might be made by any such Person if the remaining
provisions of this Section 6.1 have been complied with). Within ten
Business Days from the date hereof, QLT shall request the return or
destruction of all confidential non-public information provided to any third
parties who have entered into a confidentiality agreement with QLT since
September 1, 2013 relating to any potential QLT Acquisition Proposal and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured
in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreements.

   

 (c)

 QLT shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) notify Auxilium, at first orally and then in writing, of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting a QLT Acquisition Proposal, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a QLT Acquisition Proposal, in each case, received on or after the date hereof, of which QLT, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives is or becomes aware, or any request received by QLT or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives for non-public information relating to QLT or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a potential or actual QLT Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books and records or a list of securityholders of QLT or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a potential or actual QLT Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include the identity of the Person making such QLT Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request and a description of the material terms and conditions of such QLT Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request. QLT will keep Auxilium promptly and fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms and conditions, of any such QLT Acquisition Proposal, proposal, inquiry, offer or request.  


(d)

 Following receipt by QLT of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) that is not a QLT Acquisition Proposal but which QLT reasonably believes could lead to a QLT Acquisition Proposal, QLT may respond to the proponent to advise it that QLT can only enter into discussions or negotiations with a party in accordance with this Agreement.  


(e)

 Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if after the date hereof and before the QLT Meeting, QLT or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives, receives a written QLT Acquisition Proposal (including, an amendment, change or modification to a QLT Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date hereof) that was not solicited after the date hereof in contravention of this Section 6.1, QLT and its Representatives may:  

 

 (i)

 contact the Person making such QLT Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives solely for the purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of such QLT Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood of its consummation so as to determine whether such QLT Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a QLT Superior Proposal; and  


(ii)

 if the QLT Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such QLT Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a QLT Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the relevant action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the QLT Board of Directors under applicable Law:  

 

 (A)

 furnish information with respect to QLT and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such QLT Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, provided that (i) QLT first enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person that is no less favourable (including with respect to any "standstill" and similar provisions) to QLT than the 
 

 

 

      

     

Non-Disclosure Agreement, and sends a copy of such agreement to Auxilium
promptly following its execution and (ii) QLT contemporaneously provides to
Auxilium any non-public information concerning QLT and its Subsidiaries that
is provided to such Person which was not previously provided to Auxilium or
its Representatives; and

   

 (B)

 engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to a QLT Acquisition Proposal with the Person making such QLT Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives. 
   

  

6.2 Auxilium Right to Match

  

 

 (a)

 Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, QLT may, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the QLT Meeting, (x) accept, approve or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a QLT Acquisition Proposal (with the exception of a confidentiality agreement described in Section 6.1(e)(ii)(A), the execution of which shall not be subject to the conditions of this Section 6.2(a) and shall be governed by Section 6.1(e)) or (y) effect a QLT Change of Recommendation with respect to any QLT Acquisition Proposal, if and only if:  

 

 (i)

 such QLT Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.1 and QLT has complied with the other terms of this Section 6.2;  


(ii)

 the QLT Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such QLT Acquisition Proposal constitutes a QLT Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the relevant action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the QLT Shareholders under applicable Laws;  


(iii)

 QLT has (A) delivered a QLT Superior Proposal Notice to Auxilium and (B) provided Auxilium with a copy of the document(s) containing such QLT Acquisition Proposal;  


(iv)

 a period of at least five full Business Days (such five Business Day period, the "Right to Match Period") shall have elapsed from the later of the date on which Auxilium received the QLT Superior Proposal Notice and the date on which Auxilium received a copy of the documents referred to in clause (B) of Section 6.2(a)(iii), it being understood that the Right to Match Period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (Vancouver time) at the end of the fifth full Business Day following such later date; _provided_ , that the Right to Match Period shall be subject to Section 6.2(d);  


(v)

 if Auxilium has offered to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger during the Right to Match Period pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the QLT Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such QLT Acquisition Proposal continues to be a QLT Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Transaction as they are proposed to be amended as at the termination of the Right to Match Period and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the relevant action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the QLT Board of Directors under applicable Laws; and  


(vi)

 QLT has previously or concurrently will have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and paid the QLT Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.2.  


 

(b)

 During the Right to Match Period, Auxilium will have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction. QLT agrees that, if requested by Auxilium, it will negotiate with Auxilium in good faith to make such amendments 
 

      

   

to the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction as would enable it to
proceed with the Transaction on such amended terms. The QLT Board of Directors
will review in good faith any such offer made by Auxilium to amend the terms
of this Agreement and the Transaction in order to determine, in consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, whether such offer to
amend the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction would, if accepted,
result in the applicable QLT Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be a QLT Superior
Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Transaction as they are
proposed to be amended as at the termination of the Right to Match Period. If
the QLT Board of Directors so determines, QLT will forthwith so advise
Auxilium and will promptly thereafter accept the offer by Auxilium to amend
the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction, and the Parties agree to take
such actions and execute such documents as are necessary to give effect to
the foregoing. If the QLT Board of Directors continues to believe, in good
faith and after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such QLT Acquisition Proposal remains a QLT Superior Proposal
and therefore rejects Auxilium\'s amended proposal, QLT may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii); _provided_ , _however_ , that QLT
must concurrently therewith pay to Auxilium the Termination Fee, if any,
payable to Auxilium under Section 7.2 and must prior to or concurrently with
such termination enter into a binding agreement, understanding or arrangement
with respect to such QLT Acquisition Proposal.

   

 (c)

 The QLT Board of Directors shall reaffirm the QLT Recommendation by news release as soon as reasonably practicable after (i) the QLT Board of Directors determines that a QLT Acquisition Proposal which has been publicly announced or made is not a QLT Superior Proposal; or (ii) the QLT Board of Directors determines that a QLT Acquisition Proposal which previously constituted a QLT Superior Proposal would cease to be a QLT Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Transaction as they are proposed to be amended as at the termination of the Right to Match Period. Auxilium shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any such news release. Such news release shall state that the QLT Board of Directors has determined that the applicable QLT Acquisition Proposal is not a QLT Superior Proposal.

agreement shall not itself be a violation of this Section 6.3(b); and (B) the
foregoing shall not prevent the Auxilium Board of Directors from considering
an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and accepting an Auxilium Superior Proposal
that might be made by any such Person if the remaining provisions of this

Auxilium will keep QLT promptly and fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms and conditions, of any such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal, proposal, inquiry, offer or request.  


(d)

 Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if after the date hereof and before obtaining Auxilium Stockholder Approval, Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives, receives a written Auxilium Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited after the date hereof in contravention of this Section 6.3, Auxilium and its Representatives may:

 contact any other Person for the purpose of initiating, soliciting, facilitating or encouraging an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal;

(iv)

 engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal with any Person who has expressed interest in making an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives.

(e)

 Auxilium shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective Representatives, is aware of the provisions of Section 6.3 and this Section 6.4 and Auxilium shall be responsible for any breach of Section 6.3 or this Section 6.4 by such Persons.

Each of QLT and Auxilium irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

7.3 Effect of Termination Payment

  

 For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the payment of the amount pursuant to this Section 7.2 is the sole monetary remedy as a result of the occurrence of any of the events referred to in this Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.2(c); _provided_ that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything contained in Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.2(c) shall relieve any Party from any liability for any intentional or willful breach by it of this Agreement. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from seeking damages in respect of losses incurred or suffered by such Party as a result of any breach of this Agreement by the other Party, seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Non-Disclosure Agreement or otherwise, or seeking specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

the opinion of nationally recognized U.S. tax counsel, would cause QLT to be
treated as a United States domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In rendering such opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
will be entitled to receive and rely upon certificates containing
representations, warranties, and covenants of officers of QLT, Auxilium,
HoldCo and AcquireCo, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such
counsel and reasonably necessary to the giving of such opinion.

   

  

8.4 Notice and Cure Provisions

  

 Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the Effective Date, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be reasonably likely to: 

  

 

 (a)

 cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate between the date hereof and the Effective Date such that the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.3(b) would fail to be satisfied; or  


(b)

 result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder prior to the Effective Date such that the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a) would fail to be satisfied. 
 

  

 Subject as herein provided, a Party may elect not to complete the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions precedent contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 in favour of such Party, or exercise any termination right arising therefrom, if forthwith, and in any event prior to the Effective Date, such Party has delivered a written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered and the Party receiving such notice is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured, the Party delivering such notice may not terminate this Agreement until the earlier of the Outside Date and the expiration of a period of 30 days from such notice. If such notice has been delivered prior to the date of the QLT Meeting or Auxilium Meeting, such meeting or meetings shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. If such notice has been delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order, such application shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. For greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated as a result of such matter. 

  

8.5 Satisfaction of Conditions

  

 The conditions precedent set out in Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released when, with the approval of Auxilium and QLT, the Merger is completed.

9.6 Governing Law; Attornment; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury

  

 

 (a)

 This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Chancery Court") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in any court other than any such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Chancery Court or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  


(b)

 Each Party hereby agrees that any service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to such Person at its address set forth in Section 9.1 shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding relating to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  


(c)

 EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE, INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS, EACH OF WHICH IS HEREBY INTENDED TO BE AN EXPRESS THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS SECTION 9.6(C), ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER).  


(d)

 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.6 to the contrary, and without limiting anything set forth in Section 9.14, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support (and it will not support any of its Affiliates to bring or support) any claim, suit, action or other proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against or involving any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any related financing), including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York and the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). The Parties further agree that all of the provisions of this Section 9.6 relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any suit, action or other proceeding referenced in this Section 9.6(d), including 
 

      

   

any such Financing Source\'s respective successors and permitted assigns,
each of which is hereby intended to be an express third party beneficiary of
this Section 9.6(d).

   

  

9.7 Entire Agreement

  

 This Agreement, together with the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Voting Agreements, and any documents delivered hereunder, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the subject matter thereof. 

   

9.8 Third Party Beneficiaries

  

 Except as provided in Sections 5.1, 5.6, 5.14, and as provided for the Financing Sources pursuant to this Section 9.8, Sections 9.6(a), 9.6(c), 9.6(d), 9.9 and 9.14 (who are intended third party beneficiaries thereunder and are intended to be the only third party beneficiaries thereunder) this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

9.9 Amendment

  

 This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time but not later than the Closing, be amended by written agreement of the Parties hereto without, subject to applicable Laws, further notice to or authorization on the part of the QLT Shareholders or Auxilium Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of Sections 9.6(a), 9.6(c), 9.6(d), 9.8, 9.9 and 9.14 shall not be amended, modified or waived (with respect to the rights of the Financing Sources) without the respective Financing Source\'s prior written consent. 

  

9.10 Waiver and Modifications

  

 Any Party may (a) waive, in whole or in part, any inaccuracy of, or consent to the modification of, any representation or warranty made to it hereunder or in any document to be delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Parties (c) waive or consent to the modification of any of the covenants herein contained for its benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the obligations of the other Parties hereto or (d) waive the fulfillment of any condition to its own obligations contained herein. No waiver or consent to the modifications of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be effective or binding unless made in writing and signed by the Party or Parties purporting to give the same and, unless otherwise provided, will be limited to the specific breach or condition waived. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights and remedies available at Law or in equity or otherwise. No single or partial exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or otherwise affects any further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled. No waiver or partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed or construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term, representation or warranty in this Agreement. 

  

9.11 Severability

  

 Upon such determination that any provision is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

        

9.12 Further Assurances

  

 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments, as the other Parties may, either before or after the Closing, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement. 

  

9.13 Injunctive Relief

  

 The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived. 

  

9.14 No Recourse

  

 Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the Parties hereto, and no Financing Source shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties hereto or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. In no event, shall QLT or any of its Affiliates, and QLT agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, (A) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or (B) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims for breach of the Financing Commitment Letter commitments against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection with the Financing Commitment Letter commitments or the obligations of Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this Section 9.14 shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Financing Commitment Letter to each other or in connection therewith. 

  

9.15 Counterparts

  

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic transmission), each of which will be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together will be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument, and each Party may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to the other Party (by personal delivery, facsimile, electronic transmission or otherwise).
