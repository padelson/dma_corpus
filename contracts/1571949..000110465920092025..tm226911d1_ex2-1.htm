waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver at

$7,000,000 (the " _Seller Reserve Fund_ ") will be withheld from the Base
Cash Purchase Price at Closing in accordance with _Section 2.1(b_) and will
be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_. The
Seller Reserve Fund will be retained by or on behalf of the Seller and will
be used by the Seller solely to satisfy any potential payments to be made by
the Seller hereunder (including with respect to any costs or expenses
incurred in connection with the adjustment provisions contained in _Section
2.3_). The Seller Reserve Fund will be retained by or on behalf of the Seller
until such time as the Seller determines in its sole discretion, _provided _
that the Seller Reserve Fund will, at a minimum, be retained until such time
as the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price has been determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3_. Until such time, the Seller Reserve Fund will not be permitted
to become subject to any Lien or to be used for any purposes other than
expressly contemplated by this _Section 1.4_. For tax purposes, the Seller
Reserve Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside
by the Seller at the time of Closing.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Withholding_. The Purchaser and the Seller will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws; _provided_ that, except (a) in
the case of compensatory payments treated as wages for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or (b) if the Company fails to timely deliver to the Purchaser the
certificate set forth in _Section 1.3(h)_ at or prior to the Closing, if the
Purchaser determines that an amount is required to be deducted or withheld,
the Purchaser shall (i) at least five Business Days prior to the payment of
such amount, provide the Seller with written notice of its intent to deduct
and withhold, (ii) cooperate in good faith with the Seller to reduce or
eliminate the deduction or withholding of such amount and (iii) provide the
Seller a reasonable opportunity to deliver forms or other documentation that
would reduce or exempt such amounts from withholding. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

Article II

  



  

 _Purchase Price; Post-Closing Adjustment_

  



  

Section 2.1 _Cash Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth:

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(i) the Company\'s good faith estimates, together with reasonable
supporting detail, of (A) the Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Cash Amount_ "),
(B) the Indebtedness Amount (the " _Estimated Indebtedness Amount_ "), and (C)
the Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ");

  



  



  

(ii) a list of and, as applicable, payment instructions for the
payment of, the Estimated Transaction Expenses; and

  



  

(iii) the calculation of the Closing Cash Purchase Price (based on
the estimates referenced in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_).

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Cash
Purchase Price_ " means (i) $9,250,000,000 (the " _Base Cash Purchase Price_
"), _minus_ (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, _plus_ (iii) the
Estimated Cash Amount, _minus_ (iv) the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
_minus_ (v) the Seller Reserve Fund.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Closing Cash
Purchase Price_ " means (i) the Base Cash Purchase Price, _minus_ (ii) the
Indebtedness Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_, _plus_
(iii) the Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_,
_minus_ (iv) the Transaction Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.2_, _minus_ (v) the Seller Reserve Fund.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Final Closing Cash Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a
statement, together with reasonable supporting detail, showing the
Purchaser\'s good faith calculation of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount
and the Transaction Expenses (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Cash Amount,
Indebtedness Amount and the Transaction Expenses (including any estimates of
the foregoing pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_) shall be determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with the definitions set forth herein and
with the same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and
procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodology, as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and
shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of
purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as
a consequence of the Transactions or arising from any act, decision or event
occurring on or after the Closing.

  



  

(b) The Seller and its Representatives shall be permitted
reasonable access to review and obtain copies of the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' books and records and any work papers related to the
preparation of the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments
contemplated thereby. The Seller and its Representatives may make reasonable
inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company and their respective
accountants regarding questions or disagreements, and the Purchaser and the
Company shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such
accountants to, cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. At the request
of the Seller, the Company shall make available its and its Subsidiaries\'
personnel (during normal business hours and without material disruption to the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' business) to advise and assist the Seller
in its review of the Preliminary Statement and any objections or
disputes with respect thereto.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(c) If the Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Statement,
the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its
objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). Any Objection Statement
shall: (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted and (ii) only include mathematical or clerical errors or good faith
disagreements based on the calculation of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness
Amount or Transaction Expenses not being calculated in accordance with
_Section 2.2(a)_. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the
Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Seller, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable
by the Parties. The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any objections in the Objections Statement, but if and to the extent
they do not reach a final resolution within 20 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute
to the Valuation Firm for resolution. Any further submissions to the Valuation
Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of the Cash Amount,
Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Closing
Cash Purchase Price calculated with reference to such amounts (solely to the
extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and on  _Exhibit B_. The Parties
shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement,
including by executing a customary engagement letter. The determination of
the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and the
resulting Final Closing Cash Purchase Price calculated with reference
thereto, in each case in the manner contemplated by this _Section
2.2_, shall become final and binding on the Parties on the date the Valuation
Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Seller and the Purchaser
absent manifest error or fraud. The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm
shall be allocated between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on
the other hand, based upon the percentage of the dollar value of the disputed
amounts (as submitted to the Valuation Firm) determined in favor of the other
party by the Valuation Firm bears to the dollar value contested by such party
in the written presentation to the Valuation Firm. For example, if the Seller
submits an Objections Statement to the Valuation Firm for $1,000, and if the
Purchaser contests to the Valuation Firm only $500 of the amount claimed by
the Seller, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses
of the Valuation Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to the Purchaser
and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Seller.

  



  



  

Section 2.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

  



  

(a) If the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price is greater than the
Closing Cash Purchase Price, promptly after the date the Final Closing Cash
Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (but in any
event within three Business Days thereafter), the Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Seller the amount of such excess, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing
by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the Final Closing Cash Purchase Price is
less than the Closing Cash Purchase Price, promptly after the date the Final
Closing Cash Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2_
(but in any event within three Business Days thereafter), the Seller will pay
from the Seller Reserve Fund to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount equal to such shortfall. In no event will the
Seller be liable to the Purchaser or its Affiliates under this _Section 2.3_
for any amount in excess of the Seller Reserve Fund and the Seller Reserve
Fund will be the Purchaser\'s sole source of recourse and recovery hereunder.

  



  

(b) Any amount paid under this _Section 2.3_ shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Closing Cash Purchase Price for Tax purposes, except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no post-Closing
adjustment with respect to the Closing Stock Consideration.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
and the Seller shall designate the Paying Agent to act as agent for the
distribution of the Closing Cash Purchase Price and any other amounts payable
to the Seller hereunder, in each case in accordance with the Paying Agent
Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by the Seller in writing to the
Purchaser, all amounts to be paid to the Seller hereunder shall be paid to
the Paying Agent for further distribution to the equityholders of the Seller
in accordance with the wire and payment instructions provided by the Seller
from time to time.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

Section 2.5 _Changes in Purchaser Common Stock_. If, at any time
between the date of this Agreement and issuance of the Closing Stock
Consideration at the Closing, the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a subdivision,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, combination or other similar change in
capitalization (or any record date or ex-dividend date with respect to the
foregoing shall have occurred prior to the issuance of the Closing Stock
Consideration), the definition of Closing Stock Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, if such change occurs on or
after any date used to calculate the Purchaser Common Stock Price, the
Purchaser Common Stock Price shall also be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be construed to
permit the Purchaser to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

  



  

The Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser that, except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to the Purchaser simultaneously
with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "):

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_.

  



  

(a) The Company (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware; and (ii) has the requisite corporate power and authority to
conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or
operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is

Governmental Authority or government-sponsored entity that has jurisdiction

the Disclosure Schedule, there is no financial advisor, investment banker,
broker, finder, agent or other Person that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of the Purchaser who is entitled to any financial
advisor\'s, investment banking, brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser has delivered to the Company (i) a true and
complete copy of a fully executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, among the Purchaser and the Financing Sources party thereto (including
all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such letters in effect as of the date
hereof), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the
Financing and (ii) a true and complete copy of the fully executed fee
letter referenced therein (together, and subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ");  _provided_ that
fees, "market flex" and other economic terms which do not affect the amount,
availability or conditionality of any portion of the Financing may be
redacted. As used in this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include any other debt commitment letter (including any replacement of
the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letter in connection with any
Alternative Financing) executed and delivered in accordance with _Section
6.12_, as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance
with _Section 6.12_, including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such
letters.

  



  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser, and to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, and
enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Purchaser, and to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, in each case,
subject to the Enforceability Limitations, regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity. All commitment fees required
to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter have been paid in full by the
Purchaser or will be duly paid in full by the Purchaser as and when due. The
Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated, modified or terminated,
nor has compliance with any term thereof been waived, on or prior to the date
of this Agreement and the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in
any respect on or prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default,
in each case, on the part of the Purchaser or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, any other party, under the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii)
assuming the accuracy of the Company\'s and the Seller\'s representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ to the level required
to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and
compliance by the Company with its covenants contained in _Article VI_, in
each case, in all material respects, the Purchaser has no knowledge that any
of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied on the Closing Date
or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all
of the Purchaser\'s obligations under this Agreement will not be available to
the Purchaser on the Closing Date. The consummation of the Financing is
subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the
copy of the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company, and there are no
contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total
amount of the Financing other than those expressly set forth in the copy of
the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on or prior to the
date hereof. Except for any engagement letters or related fee letters related
to the permanent financing referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements to which the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
a party related to the funding of the Financing. Assuming the funding of the
full amount of the Financing in accordance with and subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the
aggregate proceeds of the Financing, as of the Closing Date, will be
sufficient to enable the Purchaser to pay in cash all amounts required to be
paid by the Purchaser in cash on the Closing Date, including all payments,
fees and expenses payable by the Purchaser related to or arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
required to be paid as of such date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligations of the Purchaser hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon
the Purchaser obtaining any financing.

  



   

23

 



    

  



  

Section 5.6 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, there
are no suits or proceedings pending or, to the Purchaser\'s knowledge,
threatened against the Purchaser at law or in equity, or before or by any
Governmental Authority, which if determined adversely to the Purchaser would
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the Purchaser\'s
timely performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions to occur hereunder at the Closing. As of the date hereof, the
Purchaser is not subject to any outstanding judgment, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority which would prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the Purchaser\'s timely performance under this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions to occur hereunder at the
Closing.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Investment Representation_. The Purchaser is
acquiring the Purchased Shares for its own account with the present intention
of holding such securities for investment purposes and not with a view to, or
for sale in connection with, any distribution of such securities in violation
of any federal or state securities Laws. The Purchaser is an "accredited
investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act. The Purchaser is knowledgeable about the industries in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is informed as to the risks of
the Transactions and of ownership of the Purchased Shares for an
indefinite period of time. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchased
Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or
foreign securities Laws and that the Purchased Shares may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other
disposition is registered under any applicable state or foreign securities
Laws or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act and any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies) shall be able to pay their respective debts as they
become due and shall own property that has a fair saleable value greater
than the amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities). Immediately
after giving effect to the Transactions, the Purchaser and each of its
Subsidiaries shall have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being
incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

acquire shares of Purchaser Common Stock were outstanding pursuant to the

Common Stock (including 2,139,542 time-vesting restricted stock units of
Purchaser Common Stock and 972,637 performance-vesting restricted stock units
of Purchaser Common Stock) were outstanding pursuant to the Purchaser Stock
Plans. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock
have been, and all shares of Purchaser Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Purchaser Stock Plans will be when issued in accordance with
the terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are, or will be,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

  



   

24

 



    

  



  

(b) Except pursuant to this Agreement and the Purchaser Stock
Plans, the Purchaser does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of
Purchaser Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Purchaser or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of Purchaser Common Stock or other equity securities of the Purchaser.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Closing Stock Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, the Purchaser will have sufficient authorized
but unissued shares of Purchaser Common Stock for the Purchaser to satisfy
its obligation to deliver the shares of Purchaser Common Stock constituting
the Closing Stock Consideration to be issued under this Agreement. Upon
consummation of the Transactions, the Seller (or its designees pursuant to
_Section 1.3(b)_) shall acquire good and valid title to the Purchaser Common
Stock constituting the Closing Stock Consideration free and clear of all
Liens, other than applicable federal and state securities law restrictions.

  



  

(b) Upon issuance, the Purchaser Common Stock constituting the
Closing Stock Consideration will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to any option, call,
preemptive, subscription or similar rights or Liens, other than restrictions
on transfer imposed by applicable state and federal securities laws and under

systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by
any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect. The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have designed and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is in all material
respects sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of the Purchaser are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Purchaser in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Purchaser as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Purchaser required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, the
Purchaser has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to the Purchaser\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of
the board of directors of the Purchaser (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Purchaser\'s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in the Purchaser\'s internal controls over financial reporting.

has, or will have prior to the Closing, taken all necessary action so that,
assuming compliance by the Seller with its obligations pursuant to _Section
6.15_ and the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the
Seller in _Section 4.2(c)_, no "business combination", "moratorium",
"fair price", "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation, nor any takeover-related provision in the Purchaser\'s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, would (a) prohibit or restrict the
Purchaser\'s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement or its ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement, any related agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (c)
subject the Seller to any impediment or condition in connection with the
exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement, any related agreement or
the Registration Rights Agreement.

prospectuses, reports, forms, statements, schedules, certifications and other
documents required to be filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC
by the Purchaser (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all
information incorporated therein by reference, collectively, the " _Purchaser
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or if amended, as of the date
of the last such amendment, the Purchaser SEC Documents (i) complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (to the extent then applicable), and
(ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading in any material respect.

on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and (ii) fairly presents in all material
respects, as applicable, the consolidated financial position of the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated

economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;

  



  

(c) enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial
liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other material reorganization of the Purchaser, unless,
in each case, equitable adjustments are made to the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock constituting the Closing Stock Consideration to the
extent necessary to provide to the Seller the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event and the Transactions can
still be consummated as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
or

  



  

(d) grant any demand, piggyback or shelf registration rights, the
terms of which are senior to or conflict with the rights to be granted to the
holders of registrable securities under the Registration Rights Agreement to
any other Person, or enter into any other agreements that conflicts with the

this Agreement through the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, the Seller and the Company shall not
(and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to), and they shall not
authorize, permit or direct any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates to, (a) solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any third party (other than

party\'s consideration of an Acquisition Transaction. In the event that the
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Representatives receives an
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Transaction on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Seller or the Company
shall provide the Purchaser with prompt notice thereof (such notice to include
the material terms thereof, including the identity of the person or group of
persons involved (in each case, except and only to the extent that disclosure
of such material terms is restricted pursuant to a confidentiality or non-

on the date of such notice to the Purchaser)). The Seller or the Company shall
promptly furnish the Purchaser with a copy of any written offer or other
information that it receives relating to an Acquisition Transaction (in each
case, except and only to the extent that such disclosure is restricted
pursuant to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement executed prior to
February 7, 2019 and still in effect on the date of such notice to the
Purchaser). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller may provide information
with respect to, and disclose the details and terms of the Transactions,
to its direct and indirect equityholders, pursuant to communications
consistent with the past practice of the Seller or its Affiliates made in
connection with similar transactions.

Section 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Company, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Transactions to be consummated as

Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iv) promptly

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
the Company, the Seller and the Purchaser agree to (i) make, or with respect
to the Parties\' respective Affiliates and equityholders, if applicable, cause
to be made, appropriate filings pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
required filings under any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions as soon as practicable (and, with respect to filings under the
HSR Act, within ten days after the date hereof (unless the Purchaser and the
Seller otherwise agree to a different date)), (ii) supply as soon as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 6.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Law (including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act and other
Antitrust Laws. The Parties shall cause the filings under the HSR Act to be
considered for grant of "early termination," and shall request the equivalent
under any other Antitrust Laws.

  



  

(c) Each Party shall: (i) promptly notify the other Parties of,
and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication to

discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental
Authority, (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the
Transactions and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or

any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such information shall
not be shared with employees, officers, managers or directors or
their equivalents of the other Party without approval of the Party providing
the non-public information, and (B) materials may be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Purchaser agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to take, promptly any
and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every
impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under
the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions so as
to enable the Parties to close the Transactions as soon as practicable (and
in any event no later than five Business Days prior to the Outside Date),
including committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other
disposition of assets or businesses of the Purchaser or the Company or any of

waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations
or other arrangements of the Purchaser or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of the Purchaser or the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries and (iv) any other action, including agreeing to
future behavioral remedies, requested by a Governmental Authority (each a "
_Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any Remedial Action may,
at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the
Transactions. The Purchaser\'s obligation to take Remedial Actions shall be
unconditional and shall not be qualified by reasonable best efforts and no
Remedial Actions taken pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be
considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred.

  



  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the
Transactions and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions, the Purchaser shall take any and
all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve any such
litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Parties shall cooperate with
each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as promptly
as practicable and in any event no later than five Business Days prior to the
Outside Date.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall, in all
cases, after consultation with the Seller and the Company use good faith
efforts to (i) consider and reflect all views and input provided by the
Seller and the Company with respect to such matters; (ii) reach agreement
with the Seller regarding all strategic decisions relevant to obtaining
clearance under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws, (A) determine timing
and strategy and be solely responsible for the final content of any
substantive oral or written communications with any applicable Governmental
Authority ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be
responsible for the factual representations relating to the Company or Seller
contained in filings under the HSR Act, or responses to compulsory process,
that are made by the Company or Seller without any input from the Purchaser),
and (B) lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities, in each such case
under clauses (A) and (B) with respect to seeking actions, consents, approvals
or waivers of any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws; _provided_
that, without the Seller\'s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Purchaser may not withdraw any filing
under the HSR Act ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Purchaser may
"withdraw and refile" its initial filing under the HSR Act one time in the
manner prescribed by 16 CFR § 803.12(c) without the Seller\'s consent) or
enter into any so-called "timing agreement" or similar agreement with any
Governmental Authority responsible for enforcing Antitrust Laws if such
agreement would prevent or render impossible the occurrence of the Closing
prior to the Outside Date.

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

(g) The Purchaser shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates
to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person
or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture,
collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition could reasonably be expected
to delay obtaining or increase the risk of not obtaining any clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Transactions.

  



  

(h) Whether or not the Closing occurs, the Purchaser shall
reimburse the Company promptly for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Acquired Company or its respective
Representatives related to the Company\'s obligations under this _Section
6.4_ (except for their costs and expenses to prepare and make the initial
filings required under Antitrust Laws) and such costs and expenses shall not
constitute Transaction Expenses. In addition, any reimbursement payments
received by the Acquired Companies from the Purchaser under this _Section
6.4_ shall be disregarded for determining the Cash Amount hereunder to the
extent that the applicable Acquired Company has not yet paid the corresponding
out-of-pocket cost or expense as of the Adjustment Reference Time.

  



  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" of
the Company and/or the Seller will not require the Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to expend any money to remedy any breach of
any representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any Legal Proceeding,
to waive or surrender any right, to modify any agreement (including any
Material Contract), to offer or grant any accommodation or concession
(financial or otherwise) to any third party or to otherwise suffer any
detriment, to obtain any consent required for the consummation of the
Transactions, to waive or forego any right, remedy or condition hereunder.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press
release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Seller.
Following such initial press release, the Purchaser, the Company and the
Seller shall consult with each other before issuing or filing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, filings
with the SEC or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement or
filing prior to such consultation, except as such Party may
reasonably conclude is required by applicable Law, court process or the NYSE
Rules (and then only after as much advance notice and consultation as is
feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.5_ shall not
preclude communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Seller and its Affiliates
may (i) disclose the subject matter of this Agreement and the financial
return and other financial performance or transaction information in
connection with fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting activities
to current and potential equityholders or investors and (ii) make public
disclosures that are consistent with previous public disclosures made in
accordance with this _Section 6.5_ and that do not include any previously
undisclosed material information relating to the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Access to Information; Contact with Employees,
Customers and Suppliers_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the
date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall afford to the Purchaser and its Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries
properties, books, Contracts and records, and the Company shall furnish
promptly to the Purchaser such information concerning the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' respective business and properties as the Purchaser may
reasonably request (other than any publicly available document filed by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws); _provided_
that the Purchaser and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to provide such access
or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the protection of the
attorney-client privilege or any similar doctrine of privilege or expose such
Party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that such access shall not extend to
any sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media of the sort generally referred to as a Phase II
environmental investigation. Until the Closing, the information
provided shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not,
and the Purchaser shall cause its respective Representatives not to, use such
information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions
by the Purchaser.

  



   

33

 



    

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and its Representatives
may only contact and communicate with the employees, agents,
Representatives, customers, payors, service providers, regulators, suppliers
and other material business relations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries related to the Transactions after prior consultation with and
written approval of the Seller (email being sufficient).

  



  

Section 6.7 _Access to Books and Records_. For a period of seven
years, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Company to, provide the Seller and its authorized Representatives with
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
to (a) the books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to
or on the Closing Date, solely to the extent that such access may be
reasonably requested by the Seller in connection with any Legal Proceeding
(other than relating to any dispute or issue between the Parties or their
Affiliates ( _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit or modify any
applicable rules of discovery)) or compliance with applicable Laws, and (b)
employees of the Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates for purposes of
better understanding such books and records. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Seller, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven years following the
Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing
Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the Seller and
offering to surrender to the Seller such books and records or any
portion thereof that the Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy,
alter or dispose of. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 6.7_, access to any books and records, information and employees
relating to Taxes shall be governed by _Section 9.2_ and not this _Section
6.7_.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Company shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current and former
manager, director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and each person who served as a manager, director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the
" _Indemnitees_ "), against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative) (each, a " _D andO Claim_"), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to such
position with the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, occurring or
alleged to have occurred before or at the Closing (including any DandO Claim
relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or the Transactions), to the
same extent such persons are currently indemnified pursuant to the
organizational documents of the applicable Acquired Company and in accordance
with the applicable terms and conditions of such organizational documents.

  



   

34

 



    

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the Company shall, and the
Purchaser shall cause the Company to, pay and advance to each Indemnitee
any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any DandO Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 6.8_ or the enforcement of an Indemnitee\'s rights under this
_Section 6.8_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such expenses (but only to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organization documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements as in effect on the date hereof).

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company may negotiate and purchase
"tail" insurance coverage (" _Tail Coverage_ ") for a period of six years
from the Closing with an insurer with the same or better credit rating as the
current carrier the Company has as of the date hereof with respect to the
policies of directors\' (or managers\') and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof (the "
_Existing D andO Policy_") to cover events arising on or before the Closing,
for a cost not in excess of 300% of the annual premium for the Existing DandO
Policy; _provided_  that if the Company does not negotiate and purchase such
Tail Coverage prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall negotiate
and purchase such Tail Coverage upon the Closing and provide reasonably
satisfactory evidence to the Seller of the purchase and funding of such Tail
Coverage in connection with the Closing. Such Tail Coverage shall be on terms
with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of the
Existing DandO Policy and shall be for the benefit of those Persons covered by
the Existing DandO Policy. All costs and expenses related to the Tail Coverage
shall be paid by the Purchaser, and no amount of such costs and expenses
related to the Tail Coverage shall be included in the calculation of
Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and the
Seller, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this
_Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.8_
applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee, Seller or Representative shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees, the Seller or Representatives to whom this
_Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
6.8_).

  



  

(e) In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser and the Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed
to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to members\', managers\',
directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective managers, directors or officers.

  



  

Section 6.9 _No Control of Other Party\'s Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Acquired Companies\'
operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
subject to any rights of the Seller, complete control and supervision over
its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations.

  



   

35

 



    

  



  

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall cause the Company to, and the Company
shall, for a period of at least one year following the Closing, provide to
each individual who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Company Employee_ "): (i)
at least the same base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and target
annual bonus opportunity that were provided to such Company Employee by any
Acquired Company immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) other compensation
and benefits (except any pension benefits) that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those in effect at any of the Acquired Companies
immediately prior to Closing ( _provided_ that the Purchaser may provide other
compensation opportunities in lieu of any long-term cash-based or equity-
based incentives). The Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that the
consummation of the Transactions shall constitute a "change of control" for
purposes of all Employee Plans listed in the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) For eligibility and vesting purposes (other than vesting of
future equity or other long-term incentive awards and pension benefits) and
for purposes of determining severance amounts and future vacation accruals
under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements, policies or
arrangements of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall cause each Company Employee to receive credit for his or her
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Closing to the same
extent that such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit
for his or her service under any similar or comparable Employee Plans (except
to the extent this credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits
in respect of the same period of service). In addition, if Company Employees
or their dependents are included in any medical, dental, health or other
welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Purchaser or
its Affiliates (each, a " _Successor Plan_ ") other than the plan or plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Prior
Plan_ "), the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause each Company Employee to be eligible to participate immediately,
without any waiting time, in any and all Successor Plans, (ii) cause the
Successor Plans to not include any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary
provisions with respect to pre-existing conditions, exclusions or any
actively-at-work requirements relating to such Company Employee and his or
her dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or
requirements were applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the time of
commencement of participation in such Successor Plan), and (iii) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Prior Plan ending on
the date of such Company Employee\'s commencement of participation in the
Successor Plan to be taken into account under the Successor Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if these amounts had been paid in
accordance with the Successor Plan.

  



  

(c) After the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i)
recognize and credit all accrued but unused paid time off of the Company
Employees as of the Closing Date and (ii) for at least one year following the
Closing allow each of the Company Employees to use such earned but unused
vacation and sick leave days at such times as reasonably requested by such
Company Employees provided that such times do not unreasonably interfere with
the business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company
and its Subsidiaries will be solely responsible for complying with the
requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code for any individual who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined
in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9 in connection with the
Transactions.

  



  

   

36

 



    



  

(d) Following the execution of this Agreement, to the extent that
any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments
that could reasonably be expected to constitute "excess parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) the Company shall (i) no later than four days prior to the
Closing Date solicit from each such "disqualified individual" a waiver of
such disqualified individual\'s rights to some or all of such payments or
benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that any remaining payments
and/or benefits shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder) and
deliver such waivers to the Purchaser, _provided_ that such waiver and the
Waived 280G Benefits shall not include any payments or benefits that may be
made by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates unless at least seven days
prior to the Closing, the Purchaser provides the applicable information
regarding any agreement, contract or arrangement that the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates is providing or entering into on or prior to the Closing Date
with respect to any "disqualified individual," along with a written
description, satisfying the adequate disclosure requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code, of any such agreement, contract or arrangement
and the amount or value of any such payment or benefit reasonably expected to
constitute a "parachute payment", and (ii) following the delivery of the
waivers to the Purchaser, but no later than two days prior to the Closing
Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in
clause (i), submit to a vote of holders of the equity interests of the Company
entitled to vote on such matters the right of any such "disqualified
individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits, in a manner complying with
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
along with adequate disclosure satisfying such requirements (which
determination and disclosure shall be made by the Company and shall be subject
to review and approval by the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that, any disagreement among the
Parties regarding the matters described in _Section 6.10(d)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set
forth therein). The Company shall, prior to Closing, deliver to the Purchaser
evidence that a vote of holders of the equity interests of the Company was
solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section
6.10 _and that either (x) the requisite number of votes of holders of the
equity interests of the Company was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G
Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (y) the 280G Approval was not obtained,
and, as a result, no Waived 280G Benefits shall be made or provided.

  



  

(e) The Seller hereby assigns to the Company, effective as of the
Closing, all rights to enforce all restrictive covenants and all right, title
and interest in any and all Intellectual Property (or similar rights)
resulting from any incentive equity grant agreement and/or co-invest
agreement with any current or former employees or service providers of the
Acquired Companies. Upon the request of the Purchaser, the Seller agrees to
execute such additional documents and take any actions that are necessary to
register and otherwise give full effect to the rights of the Company in and
to such Intellectual Property, including all documents necessary to record in
the name of the Company the assignment of such Intellectual Property with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office or any other
applicable Governmental Authority, in each case, in a form mutually agreed by
the Seller and the Purchaser.

  



  

(f) To the extent the Seller takes any of the actions below during
the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Seller
hereby agrees to provide the Purchaser with written notice (e-mail

Section 6.12 _Financing Obligations of the Purchaser_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to take, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange the Financing on
substantially the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter including (i) using reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter and in all material respects comply with all of
its obligations thereunder and (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver the
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions not
less favorable in the aggregate, to the Purchaser than those contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the "market flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letter) by the Closing Date, and (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to satisfy (or if determined advisable by the
Purchaser, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining
the Financing within the Purchaser\'s control and to comply with all of its
obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or other definitive
agreements related thereto to the extent the failure to comply with such
obligations would adversely impact the timing of the Closing or the
availability at the Closing of sufficient aggregate proceeds of the Financing
to consummate the Transactions. In the event that all conditions to funding
the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied
(or waived), the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce all of its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. The
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts under the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable and such portion is necessary to consummate the Transactions
(except in accordance with the express terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or unless concurrently replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
commitments subject to substantially the same conditions as those set forth in
the applicable Debt Commitment Letter from other Financing Sources or from
proceeds of other sources of financing or cash), the Purchaser shall (i) use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing for any such portion
from alternative debt sources on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no
less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any "market flex" provisions
thereof) and in an amount that will still enable the Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Financing_
"), and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor. If obtained, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all commitment letters and other definitive agreements
(including redacted copies of fee letters, removing only fees, "market flex"
and other economic terms which do not affect the amount, availability or
conditionality of any portion of the Financing) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide the Purchaser with
Alternative Financing.

  



   

38

 



    

  



  

(c) The Purchaser shall not, without the Company\'s prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any
amendment, modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related thereto unless
the terms of such Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related
thereto, in each case as so amended, modified or waived, are substantially
similar to those in such Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
related thereto, prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver (other than economic terms, which shall be as good as or better for
the Purchaser than those in such Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
agreement relating thereto prior to giving effect to such amendment,
modification or waiver); _provided_ that in the case of amendments or
modifications or waivers of any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreement relating thereto, such amendment, modification or waiver would not
reasonably be expected to (i) (A) add additional conditions precedent that
would adversely affect the ability or likelihood of the Purchaser timely
consummating the Transactions or otherwise adversely affect the ability or
likelihood of the Purchaser timely consummating the Transactions or (B) make
the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur, (ii) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (iii) materially and adversely affect
the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating thereto, it
being understood and agreed that in any event, the Purchaser may amend any of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement relating thereto to
add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities
that have not executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of such time and consent
to the assignment of lending commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter to
other lenders.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser shall provide the Company with prompt written
notice of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Financing Source with respect to such Financing Source\'s failure or
anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Debt Commitment Letter
or definitive agreement in connection therewith in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render it unable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the
Purchaser\'s efforts to consummate the Financing, including providing copies
of any amendment, modification or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter (
_provided_ that any fee letter may be redacted to remove fees, "market flex"
and other economic terms which do not affect the amount, availability or
conditionality of any portion of the Financing). The Purchaser shall give the
Company prompt notice of any (i) material breach or material default by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related
thereto of which the Purchaser obtains knowledge, (ii) actual or, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened in writing withdrawal, repudiation, or
termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or such definitive
agreements, or (iii) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements
with respect to the obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of
the Financing to be funded at Closing.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
Purchaser\'s obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon the
Purchaser obtaining any financing.

historical financial statements of the Acquired Companies and pro forma

effected by this Agreement that comply in all material respects with Rule

the Closing upon the written request of the Purchaser. For the avoidance of
doubt, any such supplement shall not constitute a representation or warranty

rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_, respectively, and (ii) cannot be cured by the Purchaser by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
30 days following receipt of written notice from the Seller of such breach or
failure to perform; _provided_ that the Seller shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if it is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
hereunder; or

  



  

(e) by the Seller, if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the
Seller has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice that it is ready,
willing and able to complete the Closing, (iii) the Purchaser has failed to
consummate the Closing when required pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (iv) the
Seller has given the Purchaser written notice at least three Business Days
prior to such termination stating the Seller\'s intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ after the Purchaser has failed
to consummate the Closing and (v) the Purchaser again fails to consummate the
Closing within three Business Days thereafter.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written
notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than _Section 6.4(h)_,
_Section 6.13(e)_, this  _Section 8.2_ and _Article X_ (other than
_Section 10.11_), all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement),
and there shall be no liability on the part of the Purchaser, the Seller or
the Company or their respective managers, directors, employees, officers or
Affiliates hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any
willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, if the
Purchaser does not close the Transactions in circumstances in which all of the
closing conditions set forth in _Section 7.1 _and _Section 7.2_ have been
satisfied or waived, such event shall be deemed to be a willful breach by the
Purchaser of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if an award of damages is sought
against the Purchaser for any alleged willful breach of this Agreement by the
Purchaser occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement, any such award
of damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Seller, which
benefit of the bargain (i.e., expectancy damages) shall be recoverable by the
Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any of
its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect equityholders
hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any Financing (including for any willful
breach); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of
the Financing Sources to the Company and its Affiliates under any definitive
agreements relating to any Financing.

  



  

Article IX

  



  

 _Certain Tax Matters_

  



  

Section 9.1 _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser shall pay and be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from and
against, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real
property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax and
other similar Taxes with respect to the Transactions (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties, interest or other additions with
respect to Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in
timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or
appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws in
connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in
connection herewith.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

Section 9.2 _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, the Purchaser,
the Seller and the Company shall cooperate with and make available to the
other Parties, during normal business hours, all books and records,
information and employees (without substantial disruption of
employment) retained and remaining in existence after the Closing relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are necessary or useful in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Returns and any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation
or any other matter requiring any such books and records, information or
employees for any reasonable business purpose.

  



  

Article X _ 
 Miscellaneous_

  



  

Section 10.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Certain Covenants_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or other agreements in this Agreement or in any
certificate, statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
other provisions, shall survive the Closing (and there shall be no liability
after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and
agreements contained herein that by their terms contemplate performance in
whole or in part at or after the Closing and then only with respect to any
breaches occurring at or after the Closing and (b) this _Article X_ (but in
the case of _Section 10.11_, solely as applied to covenants and agreements
that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring after the
Closing). The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms or (ii) terminate as of the Closing.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Acknowledgement by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives) that: (a) it has conducted to its
satisfaction its own independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and has been
afforded satisfactory access to the books and records, facilities and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting such
investigation and verification, (b) the Company Representations
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company in connection with, arising out of, or with respect to
the Transactions, (c) the Seller Representations constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Seller in connection with,
arising out of, or with respect to the Transactions, (d) except for the
Company Representations and the Seller Representations, none of the Company,
the Seller or any other Person makes, or has made, or will be purported or
deemed to have made any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
Transactions and all other representations and warranties of any kind or
nature expressed or implied (including (i) regarding the completeness or
accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any information,
including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any other
information, document or material provided to or made available to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Seller, and (ii) any relating to the
future or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' assets) are specifically disclaimed by the Seller, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the Representatives of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) and (e) the Purchaser and its Affiliates are not
relying on, and expressly disclaim any reliance on, any representations and
warranties in connection with the Transactions except the Company
Representations and the Seller Representations. In connection with the
Purchaser\'s investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
has received projections and forward-looking statements or similar
speculative financial models or assumptions, including projected statements
of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. The Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans and that the Purchaser is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts. Without limiting the foregoing
provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees
that none of the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective current or former Affiliates or Representatives is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. The
Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Person shall have or be subject to
any liability to the Purchaser, the Company or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchaser\'s use of, any such
estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information, document or
material provided to or made available to the Purchaser or its Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the Transactions. Effective upon Closing, the
Purchaser waives, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective
Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Seller and any of
its current or former Affiliates or Representatives (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) relating to the operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, whether arising under or based
upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or
regulation or otherwise. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it will
not assert, institute or maintain any action, suit, claim, investigation, or
proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or
defense, regardless of the legal or equitable theory under which such
liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes any claim
contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in this _Section 10.2_.
The Seller shall have the right to enforce this _Section 10.2_ on behalf of
any Person that would be benefitted or protected by this _Section 10.2 _if
they were a party hereto. The foregoing agreements, acknowledgements,
disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable and were a material inducement to the
Company and the Seller to enter into this Agreement and but for the foregoing
agreements, neither the Company nor the Seller would have entered into this
Agreement or consummated the Transactions.

Section 10.3 _Acknowledgement by the Seller_. The Seller
acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives) that: (a) it has conducted to its
satisfaction its own independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Purchaser, (b) the Purchaser Representations
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Purchaser in connection with, arising out of, or with respect to the
Transactions, including issuance of the Closing Stock Consideration, (c)
except for the Purchaser Representations, neither the Purchaser nor any other
Person makes, or has made, or will be purported or deemed to have made any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or the Transactions and all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied
(including (i) regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to
state or to disclose, any information including in any estimates,
projections or forecasts or any other information, document or material
provided to or made available to the Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives in expectation of the Transactions, including meetings, calls
or correspondence with management of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) any relating to the future or historical business, condition (financial
or otherwise), results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the
Purchaser, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Purchaser\'s assets)
are specifically disclaimed by the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and all
other Persons (including the Representatives of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives) and (d) the Seller and its
Affiliates are not relying on, and expressly disclaim any reliance on, any
representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except the
Purchaser Representations. Effective upon Closing, the Seller waives, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against the Purchaser and any of its current or former
Affiliates or Representatives (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
relating to the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, whether arising under or based upon any federal, state,
local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise.
The Seller acknowledges and agrees that it will not assert, institute or
maintain any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding of any kind
whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of
the legal or equitable theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and
covenants set forth in this _Section 10.3_. The Purchaser shall have the
right to enforce this _Section 10.3_ on behalf of any Person that would be
benefitted or protected by this  _Section 10.3_ if they were a party hereto.
The foregoing agreements, acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers
are irrevocable and were a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and but for the foregoing agreements, the Purchaser would not
have entered into this Agreement or consummated the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall limit, modify or waive any rights the Seller, its Affiliates or
equityholders may have in their capacity as stockholders of the Purchaser
following the Closing.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

Section 10.4 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and this
Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring or required to incur such fees
or expenses; _provided_ , that the fees and expenses payable to the Paying
Agent pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement will be borne
solely by the Purchaser.

  



  

Section 10.5 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be
amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the
Purchaser and the Seller by their duly authorized officers; _provided_ , that
such amendment or supplement is promptly delivered to the other Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
relating to the Financing Sources set forth in _Section 6.13_, _Section
8.2_, _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.9_, _Section 10.10_,  _Section 10.11_,
_Section 10.12_, _Section 10.20_ and this _Section 10.5_ (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of the provisions
relating to the Financing Sources set forth in _Section 6.13_, _Section
8.2_, _Section 10.7_,  _Section 10.9_, _Section 10.10_, _Section 10.11_,
_Section 10.12_, _Section 10.20 _and this _Section 10.5_) may not be
amended, modified, waived or terminated without the prior written consent
of the Financing Sources.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Party(ies), (b) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party(ies)
or (c) waive compliance by the other Party(ies) with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
Party\'s conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

Section 10.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that (a) prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, its obligations under _Section 1.3(b)_) to any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries, and (b) following the Closing, each Party may
assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder (i) to its Affiliates
and (ii) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Financing for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as
collateral in respect of the Financing, but, in each case, such assignment
shall not relieve such Party of its obligations or liabilities hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this _Section 10.7_ shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other Parties.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits hereto,
together with the other instruments referred to herein, including the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among

thereof and (b) except for (i) the rights of the Indemnitees and the Seller
under _Section 6.8_, (ii) the rights of the Seller\'s Affiliates and
Representatives under _Section 10.2_, (iii) the rights of the Purchaser\'s
Affiliates and Representatives under _Section 10.3_ (iv) the rights of the

Releasees and the Purchaser Releasees under _Section 10.19_ and (vi) as
otherwise expressly provided herein, is not intended to and shall not confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

_Section 8.2_, _Section 10.5_,  _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.10_, _Section
10.11_, _Section 10.12_, _Section 10.20 _and this _Section 10.9_ will
inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors and
assigns, each of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof
(it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns).

  



  

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause or permit the
application of the Laws (or any statutes of limitations) of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

(b) Other than disputes submitted to the Valuation Firm pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ (which shall be addressed in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.2_) (i) all actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom sitting
in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) no
Party shall attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (iii) a final judgment in any
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(c) Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section 10.10 _in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article
X_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect
service of process on another Party by any other legally available method.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to _Section 10.20_, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably
agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out
of, or relating to, the Transactions, the Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each
Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their respective Affiliates to bring or support anyone
else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to them at their respective addresses provided in any applicable debt
commitment letter will be effective service of process against them for any
such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed by, construed
in accordance with and enforced under the laws of the State of New York.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Specific Enforcement_. Irreparable damage would occur
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to
_Section 10.1_, if for any reason the Purchaser, the Seller, or the Company
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, if
the Closing has occurred, any failure to perform or breach for which the
Parties have no liability under this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1_), then the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such
nonperforming Party under this Agreement shall be entitled to
specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable
relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, and the Parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Prior to the Closing, to the extent any Party brings any action,
claim, complaint or other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental
Authority to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically
be extended by (a) the amount of time during which such action, claim,
complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (b)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action,
claim, complaint or other proceeding. Subject to the rights of the parties to
the definitive agreements for any Financing under the terms thereof, none of
the Company and its Affiliates and their direct and indirect equityholders
shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
against any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as
lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing, and in no event shall
the Company, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect
equityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance
of this Agreement against any Financing Source; _provided that_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall any of the Transactions be
conditioned or contingent upon the Financing or the receipt of any
proceeds contemplated by the Financing and (ii) the foregoing shall not
limit, modify or otherwise diminish the rights of the Seller and the Company
to specific performance of the Purchaser\'s obligations to consummate the
Transactions following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver at the Closing of those conditions).

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

Section 10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS OR
THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES
IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING).

  



  

Section 10.13 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications
to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when
personally delivered, (b) when transmitted via e-mail to the e-mail address
set out below if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such
notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the

Day) on which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national
overnight delivery service or (d) the third Business Day following the day on
which the same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid.
Notices, demands and communications, in each case to the respective Parties,

Section 10.17 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is
acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on behalf of its

Kirkland and Ellis LLP and its affiliated entity Kirkland and Ellis International
LLP (the " _Retained Counsel_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with
the Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has not acted as counsel for
any other Party in connection with the Transactions and that none of the other
Parties has the status of a client of the Retained Counsel for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The Purchaser and the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their respective managers, directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser, the Company, and/or
its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may represent the Seller and/or its
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller or its
Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have represented the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. The Purchaser and the Company further agree that, as to all
communications among the Retained Counsel, the Seller, any Affiliates of the
Seller, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that relate in any way to the
Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party or
any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by the Retained Counsel to such third party or
the use thereof by the Retained Counsel in connection with its representation
of a Party in such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Seller.

and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any Party or to any such contract,
each other Party or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof
and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party to any such contract shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.

statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement) and the Transactions, may be made only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons that
are expressly identified as the Parties and no Person who is not a Party,
including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, equityholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Party, or any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, equityholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_
"), will have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations,
or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or the Transactions or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach
of this Agreement and the Transactions, and, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, each Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.19(a)_ will not limit claims
with respect to Fraud to the extent expressly provided by the last sentence
of the definition thereof.

"), on behalf of itself and its respective past, present and future officers,
directors, equityholders, managers, members, partners, employees,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, in the
case of the Company, the Seller), and each of their respective successors and
assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the Seller and each of its respective past, present
and future officers, managers, directors, equityholders, partners,
members, employees, counsel and agents (each, a " _Seller Releasee_ ") of,
from and against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands,
damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever, which such Purchaser Releasor or its successors or
assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever arising in connection with any Seller Releasee\'s capacity
as an equityholder, officer, director, manager, employee, advisor
or consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries,
including any claim related to, arising out of or with respect to any actual
or alleged breach of any duties (including fiduciary duties) (the " _Purchaser
Released Claims_ "). Each Purchaser Releasor shall not, and shall cause its
respective officers, directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, and each of their respective successors and assigns, not to,
assert any Purchaser Released Claim against the Seller Releasees. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.19(b)_ shall not operate as a release or
compromise of (i) obligations of the Seller or its Affiliates under this
Agreement or under any agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement
(including pursuant to _Section 6.14_) or (ii) for any claim with respect to

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, effective as of the Closing
Date, the Seller (the " _Seller Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its
respective past, present and future officers, directors, equityholders,
managers, members, partners, employees, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company), and each of their respective
successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the Purchaser and the Company and
each of their respective past, present and future officers, managers,
directors, equityholders, partners, members, employees, counsel and agents
(each, a " _Purchaser Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all actions,
causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits
of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, which the Seller
Releasor or its successors or assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever arising in connection with
any Purchaser Releasee\'s capacity as an equityholder, officer, director,
manager, employee, advisor or consultant of the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including any claim related to, arising out of or
with respect to any actual or alleged breach of any duties (including
fiduciary duties) (the " _Seller Released Claims_ "). The Seller Releasor
shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors, equityholders,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their respective successors and
assigns, not to, assert any Seller Released Claim against the Purchaser
Releasees. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 10.19(c)_ shall not
operate as a release or compromise of any rights (i) to indemnification
under or related to any indemnification or exculpation obligations set forth
in the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' organizational documents or
otherwise, (ii) rights or claims under the Existing DandO Policy or any tail
policy in respect thereof, (iii) obligations of the Company, the Purchaser or
its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any agreement entered into
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the rights of any Seller Releasees to
compensation (in the form of wage, salary or bonus compensation) and/or
other benefits in their respective capacities as employees or independent
contractors of the Seller, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
(iv) for any claim with respect to Fraud.

  



  

Section 10.20 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. None of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or
otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 10.20_ shall limit the rights of the Company
and its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date under any debt commitment
letter or the definitive agreements executed and delivered in connection with
any Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to
the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.
