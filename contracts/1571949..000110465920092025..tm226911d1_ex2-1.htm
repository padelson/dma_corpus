the Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth
its objections thereto (an &quot;<U>Objections Statement</U>&quot;). Any Objection Statement shall: (i)&nbsp;specify in reasonable

based on the calculation of the Cash Amount,&nbsp;Indebtedness Amount or Transaction Expenses not being calculated in accordance
with <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(a)</U>. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 30 days after delivery of
the Preliminary Statement to the Seller, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections in the Objections Statement, but if and to
the extent they do not reach a final resolution within 20 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller and
the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to the Valuation Firm for resolution. Any further submissions to the Valuation Firm must
be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of the Cash Amount,&nbsp;Indebtedness
Amount, Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Closing Cash Purchase Price calculated with reference to such amounts (solely
to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>. The Parties shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement, including by executing
a customary engagement letter. The determination of the Cash Amount,&nbsp;Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and the resulting
Final Closing Cash Purchase Price calculated with reference thereto, in each case in the manner contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>,
shall become final and binding on the Parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Seller
and the Purchaser absent manifest error or fraud. The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be allocated between the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage of the dollar value of the disputed amounts
(as submitted to the Valuation Firm) determined in favor of the other party by the Valuation Firm bears to the dollar value contested
by such party in the written presentation to the Valuation Firm. For example, if the Seller submits an Objections Statement to
the Valuation Firm for $1,000, and if the Purchaser contests to the Valuation Firm only $500 of the amount claimed by the Seller,
and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Seller.</P>

the Purchaser related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required

responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller,

upon Closing, the Purchaser waives, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted

option. As used in this Agreement &quot;willful breach&quot; shall mean a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by a party with the actual knowledge that
the taking of such act or failure to act would cause a breach. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have such defined meanings
when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine
and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein and the rules&nbsp;and regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors. For purposes of this Agreement,
if the Company, the Seller or a Person acting on its or their behalf posts a document to the online data room hosted on behalf
of the Seller, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries at datasiteone.merrillcorp.com, such document shall be deemed to have been &quot;delivered&quot;,
&quot;furnished&quot; or &quot;made available&quot; (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the Seller and the Company,
as applicable, if Representatives of the Purchaser had permissions in such data room to view such document at least 24 hours prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by all Parties. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred
to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.</P>

Respecting Legal Representation</U></B>. It is acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective
managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that the Company and the Seller have
retained Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis LLP and its affiliated entity Kirkland&nbsp;&amp; Ellis International LLP (the &quot;<U>Retained
Counsel</U>&quot;) to act as their counsel in connection with the Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has not acted as counsel
for any other Party in connection with the Transactions and that none of the other Parties has the status of a client of the Retained
Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The Purchaser and the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser, the Company,
and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may
represent the Seller and/or its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller or its Affiliates may be directly
adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have represented the Company
or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute. The Purchaser and the Company further agree that, as to
all communications among the Retained Counsel, the Seller, any Affiliates of the Seller, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that
relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney&ndash;client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party
(other than a Party or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by the Retained Counsel to such third party or the use thereof by
the Retained Counsel in connection with its representation of a Party in such dispute; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller.</P>
