 (g) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement: 

    

 (i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option other than an Out-of-the-Money Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to Sections 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share (with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding), in a manner consistent with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1, 409A-1(b)(5)(D) and Section 424 of the Code equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the portion of the Stock Merger Consideration set forth on the Spreadsheet next to the name of the Person that held such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of such Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). After the Effective Time, each Assumed Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in the Company Equity Plan and the applicable stock option agreement) as were applicable to the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. It is the intent of the parties that to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all Assumed Options in respect of Company Options that, prior to the Effective Time were treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options under the Code shall from and after the Effective Time continue to be treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options, respectively, under the Code. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each holder of an Assumed Option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent. 

  

 (ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option that is identified as an out-of-the-money option in the Spreadsheet (each, an " _Out-of-the-Money_

   

      

   

 _Option_ ") shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor.
For the avoidance of doubt, each such Out-of-the-Money Option shall not be
converted into an Assumed Option.

  

 (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions in this Section 1.5 as of the Effective Time, including having the board of directors of the Company adopt all resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in Section 1.5. 

    

 (h) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant, other than an Out-of-the-Money Warrant, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time subject to Sections 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10, shall be cancelled, by virtue of the Merger and pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants and without any action on the part of the holder of the Company Warrant, and converted into the right to receive, without interest: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration set forth on the Spreadsheet next to the name of such holder of the Company Warrant; plus (ii) such holder\'s Escrow Pro Rata Fraction of any Parent Common Stock released from the Escrow Fund to the holder of such Company Warrant, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter and the terms of such Company Warrant in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Warrant that is identified as an out-of-the-money warrant in the Spreadsheet (each, an " _Out-of-the-Money Warrant_ ") shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, no Company Warrant shall be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub. 

  

 (i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock (but not Company Options) who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Parent Stock Price. 

  

 (j) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that fact by the record holder thereof, such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 1.5 in respect of such Certificate; _provided, however,_ that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond and to execute an indemnification agreement as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 (k) The maximum aggregate consideration payable by Parent or Merger Sub to any Person in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall in no event exceed the Merger Consideration (including the Stock Merger Consideration and the Cash Merger Consideration). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock Merger Consideration shall be determined three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (l) On the day three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall update the Spreadsheet to reflect the calculation of the Merger Consideration (including the Stock Merger 

  

      

  

Consideration and the Cash Merger Consideration) based on the Parent Stock
Price. In addition, and based on such calculation of the Merger Consideration,
the Company shall further update the Spreadsheet to reflect the per share
amounts payable to each class and series of Company Capital Stock pursuant to
the Company Charter and this Agreement. Such per share amounts shall be
determined based on (and shall take into consideration) the relative
priorities and preferences of each class of Company Capital Stock upon a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (including a deemed
liquidation event), all as set forth in the Company Charter.

  

  

 1.6 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent may take such action, so long as such action is consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 1.7 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and each certificate representing any such Company Capital Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent the right to receive the consideration referred to in Section 1.5 (or if applicable, Section 1.10); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Certificate shall be physically canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8. 

  

 1.8 Exchange/Payment. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Payment Amount and an amount of cash equal to the Cash Merger Consideration (less the amount of Cash Merger Consideration that is referred to in clause (ii) of the definition of Cash Merger Consideration). As promptly as practicable and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to the holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Convertible Debt and Company Warrants, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Letters of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates, Company Warrants or instrument representing the Convertible Debt, in exchange for the Parent Common Stock or cash payable in accordance with Section 1.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate, Company Warrant or evidence of Company Convertible Debt, if applicable, to the Exchange Agent for payment, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, (A) the holder of such Certificate, the holder of such Company Warrant and the Company Convertible Debt Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the shares of Parent Common Stock or cash payable in accordance with Section 1.5 for each share evidenced by such Certificate, Company Warrant or Company Convertible Debt, as applicable, _less_ the amount to be withheld in escrow in accordance with Section 1.9 of this Agreement and (B) the Certificate, Company Warrant or evidence of Company Convertible Debt, if applicable, so surrendered shall be canceled. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, as a condition to the payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock or cash payable in accordance with Section 1.5 with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock evidenced by such Certificate, require the owner of such Certificate to provide an executed affidavit to Parent in a form reasonably 

  

      

  

acceptable to Parent, which affidavit shall include a bond in such sum as
Parent may reasonably direct and an agreement to indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and the Exchange Agent from and against any losses arising therefrom.

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time (or if later, five (5) Business Days after the release referred to in the Management Incentive Plan becomes effective), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each MIP Holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the portion of the Stock Merger Consideration payable to such MIP Holder at the Closing and the amount in cash payable to such MIP Holder pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan and Section 1.5(e)(i) of this Agreement, less the amount to be withheld in escrow with respect to the MIP Management Holders. 

  

 (c) Promptly following the Effective Time and subject to Sections 1.8(f), 1.9 and 1.10, as applicable, Parent shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Assumed Option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by Parent. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the amounts payable in accordance with Section 1.5 that remains undistributed to holders of Certificates, Company Warrants or Company Convertible Debt as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered the documentation contemplated under this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the consideration payable in accordance with Section 1.5, without interest thereon. 

  

 (e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants or Company Convertible Debt with respect to any amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law or escheat law. 

  

 (f) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent (" _Withholding Agents_ ") will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Convertible Debt Holder, MIP Holder, holder of Company Warrants or any other recipient of any payment under this Agreement, the amounts the Withholding Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any other Tax Law. The Withholding Agent shall cooperate and consult with the Stockholders\' Representative regarding the amount of any such withholding tax. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly paid over to the applicable Tax Governmental Body, any withheld amounts will be treated as having been paid to the applicable holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Convertible Debt Holder, MIP Holder, holder of Company Warrants or other recipient of payments under this Agreement. 

  

  

 1.9 Escrow. 

  

  

 (a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, as a contribution to the Escrow Fund, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of ten percent (10%) multiplied by the Stock Merger Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole share, (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), which shall serve as partial security for the Participating Holders\' indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 8\. The Escrow Pro Rata Fraction of the Escrow Amount shall be withheld from the Stock Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each of the Participating Holders, which Escrow Pro Rata Fraction was determined in accordance with the Company Charter, including Section 2(g)(v) of Article IV.B thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Person, and 

  

      

  

shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Any amounts held in the Escrow Fund that
are not subject to then outstanding indemnification claims shall be released
to the Participating Holders within five (5) Business Days following the date
that is the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

 (b) Each distribution of Parent Common Stock made from the Escrow Fund to the Participating Holders shall be made in proportion to the respective Escrow Pro Rata Fractions of the Participating Holders. 

  

 (c) The Parent Common Stock deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be treated for income tax purposes as owned by the Participating Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that any income, gains, losses and expenses of the Escrow Fund shall be available to Parent as part of the Escrow Fund, and if not paid to Parent in connection with an indemnification claim in accordance with Section 8 shall ultimately be distributable to the Participating Holders in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Participating Holders shall have voting rights with respect to their allocable shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Amount. 

  

 (d) The approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, and the acceptance of a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration by the Participating Holders, shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. 

  

 (e) On the Closing Date, the Company will wire to the Stockholders\' Representative $250,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ "), which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders\' Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Participating Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholders\' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders\' Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as practicable following the release in full of the Escrow Fund, the Stockholders\' Representative will deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Participating Holders, in accordance with their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Participating Holders. 

  

  

 1.10 Appraisal and Dissenters\' Rights. 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares), will not be converted into or represent the right to receive consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, but will be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided, however,_ that if a holder of Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") withdraws or loses such holder\'s demand for such payment and appraisal or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date on which such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such demand or otherwise becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal, such holder\'s Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be converted into the right to receive payment of consideration determined in accordance with Section 1.5 (subject to Section 1.10) upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with the terms of Section 1.8. 

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of: (A) any written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal of any such demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal. Following the Effective Time, neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall, except with the prior written consent of the Stockholders\' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company makes any payment or payments with respect to any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 1.5 of this Agreement (" _Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Parent shall be entitled to recover under the terms of Section 8 hereof the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments. 

  

  

 1.11 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. No party hereto shall take any action, or fail to take any action, which is inconsistent with such intent, unless required by a Tax authority in connection with an audit or other Tax proceeding or pursuant to a change in other applicable Law, and each party shall cause all tax returns relating to the Merger to be filed on the basis of treating the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, _provided_ , _however_ , that the preceding covenant shall not be considered to be violated by actions of Parent or its affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. However, except for Parent\'s representations in Sections 3.4 and 3.7 regarding Parent Common Stock and the Merger Sub, Parent makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants regarding whether the Merger will qualify as a tax-free "reorganization" under the Code, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company and the holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby. 

  

 1.12 Stockholders\' Representative. 

  

  

 (a) In order to efficiently administer certain matters contemplated hereby following the Closing, including any actions that the Stockholders\' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with the matters set forth in Sections 1.9, 1.10 and 8, the Participating Holders, by the adoption of this Agreement, acceptance of consideration under this Agreement and/or the completion and execution of the Letters of Transmittal shall be deemed to have designated Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the representative of the Participating Holders (the " _Stockholders\' Representative_ "). 

   

 (b) The Stockholders\' Representative may resign at any time, and the Participating Holders who hold at least a majority in interest of the Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions at the time of any vote shall be authorized to replace the Stockholders\' Representative and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Stockholders\' Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto. 

  

      

  

 (c) By their adoption of this Agreement, acceptance of consideration under this Agreement and/or the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal contemplated by Section 1.8, the Participating Holders shall be deemed to have agreed, in addition to the foregoing, that: 

    

 (i) the Stockholders\' Representative shall be appointed and constituted the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Participating Holder, with full power in his, her or its name and on his, her or its behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including, without limitation, executing and delivering any agreements, amendments, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and which shall be binding on each Participating Holder. The Stockholders\' Representative hereby accepts such appointment; 

  

 (ii) without limiting the foregoing, as of the Effective Time the Stockholders\' Representative shall have full authority to (A) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of the Participating Holders (in the name of any or all of the Participating Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the Stockholders\' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the Stockholders\' Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, (B) give and receive notices and other communications relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement contemplates that such notice or communication shall be given or received by the Participating Holders individually), (C) take or refrain from taking any actions (whether by negotiation, settlement, litigation or otherwise) to resolve or settle all matters and disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (D) engage attorneys, accountants, financial and other advisors, paying agents and other persons necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders\' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing; 

   

 (iii) Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively, and shall be protected in acting, or refraining from acting, upon any written notice, instruction, request or decision given or made by the Stockholders\' Representative as to any of the matters described in this Section 1.12 as if such notice, instruction, request or decision had been given or made by all of the Participating Holders, and no party shall have any cause of action against Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any action or inaction of Parent in reliance upon any such notice, instruction, request or decision; 

   

 (iv) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholders\' Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Participating Holders; 

  

 (v) no Participating Holder shall have any cause of action against the Stockholders\' Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Stockholders\' Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholders\' Representative; 

  

 (vi) the provisions of this Section 1.12 are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Participating Holder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (vii) the provisions of this Section 1.12 shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives successors and assigns of each Participating Holder, and any references in this Agreement to a Participating Holder or the Participating Holders shall mean and include the 

   

       

   

successors to the Participating Holders\' rights hereunder, whether pursuant
to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

   

  

As between the Participating Holders, on the one hand, and the Stockholders\'
Representative on the other hand, the Stockholders\' Representative shall not
be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders\'
Representative while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted to be
done pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. The Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled to be
indemnified, defended, held harmless and reimbursed by the Participating
Holders against any loss, liability damage, claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture,
action, fee, cost and expense (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising
out of or in connection with the Stockholders\' Representative\'s execution
and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been primarily caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholders\' Representative, the Stockholders\'
Representative will reimburse the Participating Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Any such Representative Losses may be
recovered at the election of the Stockholders\' Representative, at any time
from: (i) the Expense Fund; (ii) the Escrow Fund, at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Participating Holders and to
the extent any funds remain in such fund; or (iii) from the Participating
Holders directly according to the Indemnity Pro Rata Fraction of each
Participating Holder; _provided, however,_ that while this section allows
the Stockholders\' Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the
Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Participating Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders\' Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

  

 1.13 Restricted Securities. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such shares shall, until such time that the shares are not so restricted under the Securities Act, bear a legend identical or similar in effect to the following legend (together with any other legend or legends required by applicable state securities laws or otherwise, if any):

OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED
UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE

Subject to the other provisions of this Section 8, the Participating Holders shall defend and indemnify Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives and each Person, if any, who controls or may control Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") in respect of, and hold them harmless against, any Damages suffered by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties resulting from, in connection with or arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement or third party claim that, if determined adversely, would constitute such an inaccuracy, (ii) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement, (iii) any inaccuracy in the Spreadsheet or the Closing Financial Certificate, (iv) any Dissenting Share Payments, (v) any Indemnified Third Party Claim, (vi) any Indemnified Taxes, and (vii) the matters set forth on Part 8.1(a)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The right to indemnification, payment, reimbursement, or other remedy based upon a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other indemnifiable matter set forth in this Section 8.1 shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by or any knowledge acquired at any time by any Parent Indemnified Party, whether before or after the Agreement Date or Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Indemnification by Parent. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 8, Parent shall defend and indemnify the Participating Holders (the " _Holder Indemnified Parties_ ", and, together with the Parent Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") in respect of, and hold them harmless against, any Damages suffered by the Participating Holders resulting from, in connection with or arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Parent in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Agreement or third party claim that, if determined adversely, would constitute such an inaccuracy, and (ii) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Parent in this Agreement. The right to indemnification, payment, reimbursement, or other remedy based upon a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other indemnifiable matter set forth in this Section 8.2 shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by or any knowledge acquired at any time by any Holder Indemnified Party, whether before or after the Agreement Date or Closing Date. The limitations on indemnification obligations of the Participating Holders set forth in Section 8.5 that limit the amounts of indemnification obligations (but not the source of recovery therefor), to the extent applicable to indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 8.1(a)(i) and 8.1(a)(ii), shall apply to the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 8.2(b), _mutatis mutandis_. 

  

       

 8.2 Third Party Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third-party claim (including any action or Proceeding commenced or threatened to be commenced by any third-party) that such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in indemnification pursuant to Section 8, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (and the Stockholders\' Representative, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating Holders) in writing of such claim (the " _Claim Notice_ ") and shall also deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent contemporaneously with its delivery to the Stockholders\' Representative, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating Holders. The Claim Notice shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by the Indemnified Party and shall describe (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount of the claimed Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in delivering a Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of the claim referred to therein. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to so assume control of the defense of such claim, the Indemnified Party may elect to control the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party. The party not controlling the defense of such claim (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense. The party controlling the defense of such claim (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall keep the Non-Controlling Party advised of the status of such claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-Controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such claim. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim without the prior written consent of the other of such parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the consent of Parent shall not be required with respect to any such settlement of a claim controlled by the Stockholders\' Representative if the Stockholders\' Representative agrees in writing that the Participating Holders will be responsible for any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement (subject to the limitation specified in Section 8.5) and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of Parent from further liability and does not contain an admission of liability on the part of Parent. 

  

 8.3 Indemnification Mechanics. 

  

  

 (a) In order to seek indemnification under this Section 8, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written demand (an " _Indemnification Demand_ ") to the Indemnifying Party (and the Stockholders\' Representative with a copy to the Escrow Agent, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating Holders), which contains (i) a description and the amount (the " _Asserted Damages Amount_ ") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party (to the extent ascertainable), (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2 for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages. 

  

 (b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Demand to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response (the " _Response_ ") in which it shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Asserted Damages Amount (in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment (which payment shall be made first out of the Escrow Fund and thereafter by the Participating Holders in proportion to their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions, if the Indemnifying Party 

  

      

  

is the Participating Holders) of the full Asserted Damages Amount (subject to
the limitations of Section 8.5) by check or by wire transfer, and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating Holders, within three
(3) days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by
both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the full Asserted
Damages Amount (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5) to the extent of
the Escrow Fund to Parent, and, thereafter the Participating Holders shall
pay any remaining amount to Parent in accordance with a payment method
reasonably acceptable to Parent in proportion to their respective Indemnity
Pro Rata Fractions; (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive part, but not all, of the Asserted Damages Amount (such portion, the "
_Agreed Portion_ ") in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
payment of the Agreed Portion (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5), by
check or by wire transfer and, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating
Holders, the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within three (3) days following the delivery of the Response, a
written notice executed by both such Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Agreed Portion (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5) to the
extent of the Escrow Fund to the Indemnified Party, and, thereafter the
Participating Holders shall pay any remaining amount to the Indemnified Party
in accordance with a payment method reasonably acceptable to Parent in
proportion to their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions; or (iii) dispute
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Asserted Damages
Amount.

   

 (c) In the event that, pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall (i) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Asserted Damages Amount, or (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled only to receive the Agreed Portion of the Asserted Damages Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of the indemnification claims that comprise the Asserted Damages Amount (or the portion of the Asserted Damages Amount not comprising the Agreed Portion). If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both such parties and, in the case of a demand for recovery from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent, and payment shall be made in accordance with the methodology in Section 8.3(b). If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Response, the matter set forth in the applicable Indemnification Demand will be resolved in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper pursuant to Section 10.5 of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Following the delivery of an Indemnification Demand, the Indemnifying Party and its representatives and agents shall be given all such access (including electronic access, to the extent available) as they may reasonably require to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and access to such personnel or representatives of the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, including but not limited to the individuals responsible for the matters that are subject of the Indemnification Demand, as they may reasonably require for the purposes of investigating or resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in the Indemnification Demand. 

  

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party fails to deliver a Response as contemplated by Section 8.3(b) prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-calendar day period, then the indemnity claim set forth in the Indemnification Demand shall be conclusively determined in the Indemnified Party\'s favor for purposes of this Section 8, and the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for the amount of the Damages stated in such Indemnification Demand on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the Damages (or any portion thereof) are estimated, on such later 

  

      

  

date when the amount of such Damages (or such portion thereof) becomes
finally determined, in either case, subject to the limitations of this Section
8.3.

  

 (f) In the case of payments to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund and thereafter by the Participating Holders, as applicable, in satisfaction of Indemnification Demands pursuant to this Section 8, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock paid to Parent shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Asserted Damages Amount, the Agreed Portion, or such other Damages amount per this Section 8, as applicable, by (ii) the Parent Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

  

  

 8.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document delivered to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders\' Representative pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive until 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.1 ("Due Incorporation; No Subsidiaries; Etc."), Section 2.3 ("Capitalization, Etc."), Section 2.19 ("Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement"), Section 2.20 ("Non-Contravention; Consents", except the portions of Section 2.20 that relate to Material Contracts), Section 3.1 ("Due Incorporation"), Section 3.2 ("Authority; Binding Nature"), Section 3.3 ("Non-Contravention; Consents", except for Section 3.3(c) or the other portions of Section 3.3 that relate to Contracts) and Section 3.4 ("Parent Capitalization") (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 2.14 ("Tax Matters") shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (together with the Fundamental Representations, the " _Special Claims_ "); (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.9 ("Intellectual Property; Privacy and Security of User Data") shall survive until eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (" _IP Claims_ "); and (iv) in the event of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, any claim for losses arising therefrom shall survive indefinitely. If an Indemnified Party delivers to the Indemnifying Party (or the Stockholders\' Representative, as applicable), before expiration of a representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice or an Indemnification Demand based upon a breach of such representation or warranty, then the demand for indemnification set forth therein shall survive until the resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice or Indemnification Demand. It is the express intent of the parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated by this Section 8.4 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 8.4 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of arms\'-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties. 

  

 8.5 Limitations. 

  

  

 (a) Except with respect to Fundamental Representations and the matters set forth in Section 8.1(a)(iii), no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any recovery resulting from Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) until such time (if at all) as the total amount of all Damages (calculated, without limitation, in accordance with Section 8.3) that have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Basket_ "); and in such event, the Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.5(b) below, be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for all Damages, including the Basket. 

  

 (b) If the Merger is consummated, except for Special Claims, IP Claims and the matters set forth in Sections 8.1(a)(ii), 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(a)(iv), 8.1(a)(vi) and 8.1(a)(vii) or fraud or intentional misrepresentation, recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive means for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to collect any Damages for which they are entitled to indemnification under 

  

      

  

this Agreement or otherwise and under any theory of liability; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Participating Holder\'s liability to Parent for Damages in
circumstances not limited to the Escrow Fund shall be several and not joint
and shall not exceed such Participating Holder\'s Indemnity Pro Rata
Fraction multiplied by the Damages except in cases of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by such Participating Holder or willful breaches of
covenants by a Participating Holder, in which case such Participating
Holder\'s liability shall not be limited by the Indemnity Pro Rata Fraction of
the Damages. An Indemnified Party shall first seek recovery of any Damages
from the Escrow Fund prior to seeking recovery directly from any
Participating Holder and, in the event that an Indemnified Party is seeking
recovery for Damages directly from a Participating Holder, the Indemnified
Party shall seek recovery from each Participating Holder for their Indemnity
Pro Rata Fraction of such Damages (except in the event of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of covenants by a Participating Holder,
in which case recovery may be sought against such Participating Holder in
excess of such Participating Holder\'s Indemnity Pro Rata Fraction). Each
Participating Holder\'s liability to Parent for Damages for IP Claims shall
not (inclusive of all other claims for Damages pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i)),
in the aggregate, exceed such Participating Holder\'s Indemnity Pro Rata
Fraction multiplied by twenty percent of the Merger Consideration Amount. Each
Participating Holder\'s liability to Parent for Damages pursuant to Sections
8.1(a)(ii), 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(a)(iv), 8.1(a)(vi) and 8.1(a)(vii), and Special
Claims shall not (inclusive of all other claims for Damages pursuant to
Section 8.1(a)) exceed such Participating Holder\'s Indemnity Pro
Rata Fraction multiplied by the Merger Consideration Amount. In the cases of
fraud or willful breaches of covenants by a Participating Holder, such
Participating Holder\'s liability shall not be limited by such Participating
Holder\'s Indemnity Pro Rata Fraction of Damages. Each Participating Holder\'s
liability for any Indemnified Third Party Claim shall be limited as set forth
in this Section 8.5(b) based on the nature of the matter giving rise to such
Indemnified Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except in cases of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation by such Participating Holder or willful
breaches of covenants by such Participating Holder, in no event shall each
Participating Holder\'s liability to Parent for Damages under this Agreement
exceed the aggregate portion of the Merger Consideration payable by Parent to
that Participating Holder pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Management Incentive Plan.

  

 (c) The amount of Damages otherwise recoverable under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) hereof shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar cash payment actually received by the Indemnified Parties from any third party with respect thereto, net of costs of recovery and increased insurance premium resulting from such claims. 

  

 (d) Any Damages for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 8 shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 (e) Subject to specific performance and other equitable remedies, if the Merger is consummated, the indemnification provisions under this Section 8 will be the sole and exclusive remedy of an Indemnified Party attributable to claims under, relating to or arising out of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Person\'s rights or obligations under any agreement other than this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 8 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, only the Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right, power and authority to commence any action, suit or Proceeding, by and on behalf of any or all Participating Holders, 

  

      

  

against Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and in no
event shall any Participating Holder himself, herself or itself have the
right to commence any action, suit or Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation in such connection. By virtue of the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders,
each Participating Holder (regardless of whether or not such Participating
Holder votes in favor of the adoption of the Agreement and the approval of
the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent in lieu thereof) shall
be deemed to have waived, and shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed
that such Participating Holder shall not have and shall not exercise or
assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right or remedy against the Surviving Corporation
in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which such Participating Holder may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement or the related facts and circumstances underlying any such
indemnification obligation or other liability.

 (c) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of Section 4.3 or a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; _provided, however_ , that no cure period shall be applicable for a breach of Section 4.3 or a breach which by its nature cannot be cured; 

  

 (d) by the Company if the Company is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof to Parent; _provided, however_ , that no cure period shall be applicable for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured; 

  

 (e) by Parent if the Initial Stockholder Consents are not delivered to Parent before 7:45 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Agreement Date; 

  

 (f) by the Company if the Required Parent Stockholder Vote has not been obtained by December 31, 2013; or

 9.2 Effect of Termination. 

  

  

 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; _provided, however,_ that this Section 9.2 and Section 10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _further_ , that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of liability for such party\'s intentional breach of this Agreement prior to its termination. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 9.2(a), in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(e), then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the following sentence, a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to Parent\'s reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, not to exceed $2,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). The Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company within two Business Days after such termination. If the Company fails to pay when due the Termination Fee, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent of its rights under this Section 9.2, and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in full) at an annual rate three percentage points above the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(e), Parent\'s right to receive the Termination Fee and the other amounts set forth in this Section 9.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives against the Company or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, and Parent (on its own behalf and on behalf of its stockholders and Affiliates) shall be deemed to have waived all other remedies (including equitable remedies) with respect to: (i) any failure of the Merger to be consummated; (ii) any breach by the Company of its obligations to consummate the Merger or any other provision set forth in this Agreement; or (iii) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.

RECITALS 

  

 A. Parent, Polo Corp., a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), Jumptap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ") and the Stockholders\' Representative have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated August 13, 2013 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "; capitalized terms used herein without definitions shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ). 

  

 B. The Merger Agreement contemplates the establishment of an escrow arrangement to partially secure rights to hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnified Parties for any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Indemnified Parties may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are in connection with the matters set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 C. Pursuant to Section 1.12 of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders\' Representative has been irrevocably appointed to serve as the Stockholders\' Representative and attorney-in-fact for each of the Participating Holders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for, among other things, administration of the provisions of Section 8 of the Merger Agreement and this Escrow Agreement. 

  

 In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
ESCROW DEPOSIT 

  

 Section 1.1 _ Receipt of Escrow Property._ Pursuant to Section 1.9 of the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an aggregate of [  ] shares of Parent Common Stock in book entry form (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") to be held as a book position in the name of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. The Escrow Shares, plus all dividends and other distributions and payments thereon received by the Escrow Agent, less any Escrow Shares distributed, delivered or paid pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, are collectively referred to as the " _Escrow Property_." The Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow Property in a designated escrow account, which shall be referred to herein as the " _Escrow Account_." 

  

 Section 1.2 _ Voting of Escrow Shares._ The Participating Holders shall be the record owners of the Escrow Shares, and shall be entitled to exercise all voting rights and all other rights with respect to their Escrow Shares. The Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right, on behalf of, and pursuant to instructions from, the Participating Holders, to direct the Escrow Agent in writing as to the exercise of any voting rights pertaining to the Escrow Shares, and the Escrow Agent shall comply with any such written instructions. In the absence of such instructions, the Escrow Agent shall not vote any of the 

        

Escrow Shares. The Stockholders\' Representative shall have no obligation to
solicit consents or proxies from the Participating Holders for purposes of any
such vote.

   

 Section 1.3 _ Security Interest._ To the extent and so long as the Escrow Property is held in the Escrow Account hereunder, Parent shall have, and the Participating Holders (through the Stockholders\' Representative) hereby grant, as of and from the date of this Agreement, a perfected, first-priority security interest in such Escrow Property to secure payment of amounts, if any, payable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of Section 8 of the Merger Agreement (such interest, the " _Parent Security Interest_ "). In connection therewith, each Participating Holder (through the Stockholders\' Representative) expressly agrees: (a) that the Escrow Agent is acting solely as Parent\'s agent to the extent necessary to perfect Parent Security Interest in the Escrow Property; and (b) to execute and deliver such instruments as Parent may from time to time reasonably request for the purpose of evidencing and perfecting such Parent Security Interest. Nothing in this Section 1.3 shall grant any rights to the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Stockholders\' Representative with respect to the Escrow Property other than the rights expressly set forth in this Escrow Agreement, which shall be exclusive of any other rights or remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. Upon the distribution of the Escrow Property pursuant to Section 2.3 to the Participating Holders, the security interests created pursuant to this Section 1.3 with respect to such Escrow Property shall be automatically released and terminated. 

   

 Section 1.4 _ Dividends._ Parent and Stockholders\' Representative (on behalf of each of the Participating Holders) agree among themselves, for the benefit of Parent and the Escrow Agent, that any shares of Parent capital stock or other property, cash distributable or issuable (whether by way of dividend, stock split or otherwise) in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow Shares (including pursuant to or as a part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or liquidation involving Parent) shall not be distributed or issued to the beneficial owners of such Escrow Shares, but rather shall be distributed or issued to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account as part of the Escrow Property. Any securities or other property received by the Escrow Agent in respect of any Escrow Shares held in escrow as a result of any stock split or combination of shares of Parent Common Stock, payment of a stock dividend or other stock distribution in or on shares of Parent Common Stock, or change of Parent Common Stock into any other securities pursuant to or as a part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or liquidation involving Parent, or otherwise, shall be held by the Escrow Agent as, and shall be included within the definition of, Escrow Property. 

  

 Section 1.5 _ Transferability._ The interests of the Participating Holders in the Escrow Account and in the Escrow Property shall not be assignable or transferable, other than by operation of law, and any attempt to assign in contravention of this Section 1.5 shall have no force and effect. No assignment or transfer of any of such interests by operation of law shall be recognized or given effect until Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of such assignment or transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participating Holder may transfer and assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement, including its interests in the Escrow Account and in the Escrow Property to other trusts or similar estate planning vehicles designated by such Participating Holder. To effect any such transfer and assignment, the Participating Holder shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to the Stockholders\' Representative) a written notice stating: (i) the Participating Holder\'s bona fide intention to transfer all or part of such Participating Holder\'s interests under this Agreement; (ii) the name of each proposed transferee; and (iii) the amount of the Participating Holder\'s interest to be transferred to each proposed transferee. As a condition to any such transfer, the transferee shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall provide the Escrow Agent with his, her or its W-9 or W-8. 

  

 Section 1.6 _ Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be retained in or released from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement. In connection with any release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account, any fractions of shares below 0.5 shall be rounded down and 

        

not released to the Participating Holder, and any fractions of shares equal
to or above 0.5 shall be rounded up and released to the Participating Holder
(provided that the Stockholders\' Representative shall have the authority to
effect such rounding (via instructions provided by the Escrow Agent) in such a
manner that the total number of whole Escrow Shares to be distributed equals
the number of Escrow Shares then being distributed).

  

 Section 1.7 _ Trust Fund._ The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Person, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.8 _ Tax Treatment._ The Participating Holders shall be treated for income tax purposes as owning the Escrow Shares, and all dividends, interest and other income from investment of the Escrow Property shall, as of the end of each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Service, be reported as having been earned by the Participating Holders, whether or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year; provided, however, that any income, gains, losses and expenses of the Escrow Fund shall be available to Parent as part of the Escrow Fund, and if not paid to Parent in connection with an indemnification claim shall ultimately be distributable to the Participating Holders in accordance with the Merger Agreement and this Agreement. 

  

    
ARTICLE 2 
ESCROW ADMINISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION 

  

 Section 2.1 _ Administration of Escrow Property._ 

  

  

 a. In order to seek indemnification pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent (whether on behalf of itself of any other Parent Indemnified Party) shall deliver a written demand (an " _Indemnification Demand_ ") to the Stockholders\' Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, which contains (i) a description and the amount (the " _Asserted Damages Amount_ ") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party (to the extent ascertainable), (ii) a statement that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages. 

  

 b. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Demand to the Stockholders\' Representative, the Stockholders\' Representative shall deliver to Parent a written response (the " _Response_ ") in which it shall: (i) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Asserted Damages Amount (in which case the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment (which payment shall be made first out of the Escrow Fund and thereafter by the Participating Holders in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Fractions) of the full Asserted Damages Amount (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5 of the Merger Agreement) by check or by wire transfer, and the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the full Asserted Damages Amount (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5 of the Merger Agreement) to the extent of the Escrow Fund to Parent, and, thereafter the Participating Holders shall pay any remaining amount to Parent in accordance with a payment method reasonably acceptable to Parent in proportion to their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions; (ii) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Asserted Damages Amount (such portion, the " _Agreed Portion_ ") in which case the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment of the Agreed Portion (subject to the limitations of Section 8.5 of the Merger Agreement), by check or by wire transfer and the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both such 

  

      

  

Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Portion (subject
to the limitations of Section 8.5 of the Merger Agreement) to the extent of
the Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnified Party, and, thereafter the
Participating Holders shall pay any remaining amount to the Parent Indemnified
Party in accordance with a payment method reasonably acceptable to Parent
in proportion to their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Fractions; or (iii)
dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Asserted
Damages Amount.

  

 c. In the event that, pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the Stockholders\' Representative shall (i) dispute that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Asserted Damages Amount, or (ii) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled only to receive the Agreed Portion of the Asserted Damages Amount, the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of the indemnification claims that comprise the Asserted Damages Amount (or the portion of the Asserted Damages Amount not comprising the Agreed Portion). If the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both such parties and, in the case of a demand for recovery from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent, and payment shall be made in accordance with the methodology in Section 2.1(b). If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Response, the matter set forth in the applicable Indemnification Demand will be resolved in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Merger Agreement. 

   

 d. If the Stockholders\' Representative fails to deliver a Response as contemplated by Section 2.1(b) prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-calendar day period, then the indemnity claim set forth in the Indemnification Demand shall be conclusively determined in the Parent Indemnified Party\'s favor for purposes of Section 8 of the Merger Agreement, and the Parent Indemnified Party shall be indemnified by the Participating Holders for the amount of the Damages stated in such Indemnification Demand on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the Damages (or any portion thereof) are estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Damages (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined, in either case, subject to the limitations of this Section 2.1. 

  

 e. The Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Property to the Parent, for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties, solely under the following circumstances: (i) as set forth in a joint notice, signed by Parent and the Stockholders\' Representative, delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Merger Agreement and Section 2.1(b) or (c) above, (ii) as set forth in any final, non-appealable court order, or (iii) in the event Stockholder\'s Representative fails to deliver a Response as contemplated by Section 2.1(b) prior to the expiration of the thirty (30)-calendar day period, after receipt of an Indemnification Demand, as set forth in such Indemnification Demand. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _ Security Procedure For Fund Transfers._ The Escrow Agent shall confirm each fund transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by means of the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow Agent shall become a part of this Escrow Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or B-2 or a rescission of an existing Exhibit B-1 or B-2 is delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, such document shall be accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the Party under this Escrow Agreement. 

        

 The Parties understand that the Escrow Agent\'s inability to receive or confirm funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected by such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such delay. 

  

 Section 2.3 _ Release of Escrow Property._ Within five (5) Business Days of the day that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall remit to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Participating Holders, such further distribution to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the Exchange Agent\'s receipt of the Escrow Property, based on each Participating Holder\'s Escrow Pro Rata Fraction as set forth next to each Participating Holder\'s name on Exhibit A hereto all the shares of Parent Common Stock and other Escrow Property, if any, then held in the Escrow Account; provided, however, that if the Escrow Agent has received from any Indemnified Party an Indemnification Demand prior to the Termination Date setting forth a claim that has not been resolved by the Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall retain the lesser of (a) all Escrow Property remaining in the Escrow Account or (ii) the amount of Escrowed Property that would be sufficient to cover the claims subject to Indemnification Demands that have not been resolved prior to the Termination Date. Such retained Escrow Property shall be administered and distributed in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.4 _ Method of Distribution._ Any distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to be made to the Participating Holders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be made by delivery of such Escrow Shares to the Exchange Agent.

ARTICLE II 
TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS 

  

 Section 2.1. _ _General Transfer Restrictions. The right of the Stockholders to transfer any Shares held by it is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article II. 

  

  

 (a) Each Stockholder acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be Transferred except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each Stockholder covenants that the Shares will only be disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with any applicable state and foreign securities laws. In connection with any Transfer of the Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, to the Company or pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A (or any similar provision then in force), the Company may require the Stockholder to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the Stockholder and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such Transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company hereby consents to and agrees to register on the books of the Company and with its transfer agent, without any legal opinion, except to the extent that the transfer agent requests such legal opinion, any Transfer of Shares by a Stockholder to an Affiliate of such Stockholder or to any general or limited partner of such Stockholder and (ii) each Stockholder may enter into hedging, collar or similar transactions with respect to the Shares to reduce such Stockholder\'s risks relating to its holdings of the Shares, and any such activities or transactions shall not be deemed to be a Transfer hereunder. 

  

 (b) Each Stockholder agrees to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 2.1, of the following legend on any certificate evidencing any of the Shares: 

    

 THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER THE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

    

 Certificates evidencing the Shares shall not be required to contain such legend or any other legend (i) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to an effective registration statement (including the Shelf Registration Statement described in Section 3.1) covering the resale of the Shares, (ii) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A (or any similar provision then in force) or if the Shares are transferrable by a person who is not an Affiliate of the applicable Stockholder pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A (or any similar provision then in force) without any volume or manner of sale restrictions thereunder, in each case if the holder provides the Company with a legal opinion reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that the Shares were sold under Rule 144 or Rule 144A or (iii) if the holder provides the Company with a legal opinion reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that the legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including controlling judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC).

ARTICLE III 
REGISTRATION RIGHTS 

   

 The Company hereby grants to each of the Holders the registration rights set forth in this Article III, with respect to the Registrable Securities owned by such Holders: 

  

 Section 3.1. _ _Shelf Registration 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall file under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than the Filing Deadline, a Registration Statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC (such filing, the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, but in any event, in the case where the Form S-3 is not subject to review by the SEC, such Shelf Registration Statement shall be effective not later than the later of (i) fifteen (15) Business Days following the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) five (5) Business Days following notification by the staff of the SEC that no review will be performed. The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement effective until the date on which there are no Registrable Securities held by any of the Holders. In no event shall the Company be required to file, and maintain effectiveness of more than one Shelf Registration Statement at any one time. 

  

 (b) If the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent senior executive of the Company, stating that the filing, effectiveness or continued use of the Shelf Registration Statement would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, then the Company shall have a period of not more than 30 calendar days (or such longer period as the Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities shall consent to in writing) within which to delay the filing or effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement that has been declared effective, to suspend the use by Holders of such Shelf Registration Statement (in each case, a " _Shelf Suspension_ "); provided, however, that, unless consented to in writing by Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension more than twice during any 12-month period, and there must be at least 90 calendar days between each permitted Shelf Suspension. In the case of a Shelf Suspension that occurs after the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders upon the termination of any Shelf Suspension, and (i) in the case the Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective, shall promptly thereafter file the Shelf Registration Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act and (ii) in the case Shelf Registration Statement has become effective, shall amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission prior to the expiration of the Shelf Suspension and furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used by the Company for the Shelf Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or 

  

      

  

the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be
requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then
outstanding.

  

 (c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated in this Section 3.1, and to submit to the SEC, within two Business Days after the Company learns that no review of the Shelf Registration Statement will be made by the staff of the SEC or that the staff has no further comments on the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, a request for acceleration of effectiveness (or post effective amendment, if applicable) of the Shelf Registration Statement to a time and date not later than two Business Days after the submission of such request. 

  

 (d) Any reference herein to a registration statement or prospectus as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time. Any reference to a prospectus as of any time shall include any supplement thereto, preliminary prospectus, or any free writing prospectus in respect thereof. 

  

 (e) In connection with the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall: 

    

 (i) prepare and file with the SEC within the time periods specified in Section 3.1(a), a Shelf Registration Statement on any form which may be utilized by the Company and which shall register all of the Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders thereof in accordance with (except if otherwise required pursuant to written comments received from the SEC upon a review of such Shelf Registration Statement) the "Plan of Distribution" section attached hereto as Exhibit A and use cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become effective in the time period described above; 

  

 (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement (including without limitation, any required post effective amendments) and the prospectus included therein as may be necessary to effect and maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement for the period specified in Section 3.1(a) hereof, and as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the instructions applicable to the form of such Shelf Registration Statement; 

   

 (iii) include in the Shelf Registration Statement the "Selling Securityholders" (to include any charitable entities and all limited partners to whom Stockholders that are limited partnerships might distribute Registrable Securities) and "Plan of Distribution" sections in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A; 

  

 (iv) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the methods of disposition as described in Exhibit A by the Holders provided for in such Shelf Registration Statement; 

   

 (v) provide the Holders and, if any, single legal counsel designated by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding ("Holder Counsel") a reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of such Shelf Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the SEC and each amendment or supplement thereto (but not including any documents incorporated by reference), in each case subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, and give reasonable consideration to any comments Holder Counsel provides with respect to any Shelf Registration Statement or amendment or 

   

      

   

supplement thereto. The Company shall furnish to Holder Counsel copies of any
correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Company or its
representatives relating to any Shelf Registration Statement;

  

 (vi) keep the Shelf Registration Statement current and continuously effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the date set forth in Section 3.1(a). The Shelf Registration Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; 

  

 (vii) notify the Holders (A) when the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein or any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (B) of any comments by the SEC with respect thereto or any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for that purpose, (D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose (in the cases of (C) and (D), the Company shall obtain the withdrawal of such stop order or suspension at the earliest practicable time) or (E) if at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, that such Shelf Registration Statement, prospectus, prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment does not conform in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing (the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement to conform to such requirements or to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver such number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the selling Holders as the selling Holders may reasonably request); and 

  

 (viii) in the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (A) register the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form reasonably acceptable to the Holders, including a Form S-1 and (B) undertake to register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available. 

    

 (f) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a duly completed Selling Securityholder Questionnaire substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto no later than , 2013. Each Holder further agrees that it shall not be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or use the prospectus for offers and resales of Registrable Securities at any time, unless such Holder has returned to the Company a completed and signed Selling Securityholder Questionnaire. Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that the information in the Selling Securityholder Questionnaire will be used by the Company in the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement and hereby consents to the inclusion of such information in the Shelf Registration Statement. Each Holder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Holder to the Company contained in a Selling Securityholder Questionnaire or of the occurrence of any event in either case that could cause the prospectus to contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Holder or its intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material fact regarding 

  

      

  

such Holder or its intended method of disposition of such Registrable
Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and
promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to
correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that
such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to each Holder or the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances then existing. If any Holder fails to provide to the Company any
information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 3 after such
Holder became aware of the inaccuracy, omission or required change, the
Company may suspend the use of the Shelf Registration Statement and the
prospectus contained therein until such time as such Holder provides the
required information to the Company (or until such time as the Company amends
the Shelf Registration Statement to exclude such Holder\'s Registrable
Securities therefrom).

  

  

 Section 3.2. _ _Piggyback Registrations. 

  

  

 (a) In addition to the Company\'s obligations with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement set forth in Section 3.1, the Company shall also notify all Holders of Registrable Securities in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the filing of any other Registration Statement under the Securities Act for purposes of an underwritten public offering of securities of the Company (including, but not limited to, registration statements relating to secondary offerings of securities of the Company) and will afford each such Holder an opportunity to include in such Registration Statement all or part of such Registrable Securities held by such Holder. Each Holder desiring to include in any such Registration Statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities held by it shall, within fifteen (15) days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. In such event, the right of any such Holder to include Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be conditioned upon such Holder\'s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder\'s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company. If a Holder decides not to include all of his, her or its Registrable Securities in any registration statement thereafter filed by the Company, such Holder shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent Registration Statement as may be filed by the Company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the underwriter determines in good faith that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten in any offering covered by this Section 3.2, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated, first, to the Company, and second, to the Holders and any other stockholders of the Company with piggyback registration rights, on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders or such other stockholders. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter, delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. For any Holder which is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, retired partners, members, retired members and stockholders of such Holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, retired partners, members and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing person shall be deemed to be a single "Holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "Holder" shall be based upon the 

  

      

  

aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities
and individuals included in such "Holder," as defined in this sentence.

  

 (c) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 3.2 whether or not any Holder has elected to include securities in such registration, and shall promptly notify any Holder that has elected to include shares in such registration of such termination or withdrawal. The Registration Expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof. 

  

  

 Section 3.3. _ _Expenses of Registration. All expenses incurred in connection with all registrations effected pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 shall be paid by the Company, including all registration, SEC, stock exchange, filing and qualification fees (including state securities law fees and expenses), printing expenses, accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for and independent public accountants of the Company, and fees and expenses of all Persons retained by the Company and, with respect to registrations effected pursuant to Section 3.2, fees and expenses of one counsel to the Holders and the other stockholders of the Company who may be participating in such registration shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay stock transfer taxes or underwriters\' discounts or selling commissions relating to sales of Registrable Securities. 

  

 Section 3.4. _ _Obligations of the Company. Whenever required under this Article III to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall (in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3.1(e) with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement), as expeditiously as reasonably possible: 

  

  

 (a) use its reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary or final prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order as soon as practicable; 

  

 (b) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement and their respective counsel, in connection with the registration or qualification of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of each state and other jurisdiction of the United States as any such Holder or their respective counsel reasonably request in writing, and do any and all other things reasonably necessary or advisable to keep such registration or qualification in effect; provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or take any action which would subject it to taxation or general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject; 

  

 (c) notify the Holders of any pending proceeding against the Company under Section 8A of the Securities Act in connection with the offering of the Registrable Securities; 

  

 (d) comply with all requirements of the New York Stock Exchange with regard to the issuance of the Shares and use reasonable best efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the New York Stock Exchange or any securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed; 

  

 (e) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of the Registration Statement; 

  

 (f) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered hereunder and provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities included in any registration statement not later than the effective date of such registration statement; 

  

      

  

 (g) notify each seller of Registrable Securities promptly of any request by the SEC for the amending or supplementing of such registration statement or prospectus or for additional information; 

  

 (h) advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order should be issued; and 

   

 (i) furnish to the Holders such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them. 

  

  

 Section 3.5. _ _Indemnification. 

  

  

 (a) The Company will, and does hereby undertake to, indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities, each of such Holder\'s officers, directors, employees, partners and agents, each Person controlling such Holder, and the officers, directors, employees, partners and agents of each Person controlling such Holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state law arising out of or based on (A) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other similar document (including any related Registration Statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made, (B) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of any federal, state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, or (C) any failure to register or qualify Registrable Securities in any state where the Company or its agents have affirmatively undertaken or agreed that the Company will undertake such registration or qualification on behalf of the Holders of such Registrable Securities (provided that in such instance the Company shall not be so liable if it has undertaken its reasonable efforts to so register or qualify such Registrable Securities) and will reimburse, as incurred, each such Holder and each such director, officer, partner, agent and controlling person, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission made in reliance and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein (including, without limitation, information included on such Holder\'s Selling Securityholder Questionnaire). 

  

 (b) Each Holder will, and if Registrable Securities held by or issuable to such Holder are included in such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Article III, does hereby undertake to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, employees, agents and officers, and each Person controlling the Company and its directors, employees, agents and officers, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such Registration Statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made, and will reimburse, as incurred, the Company, each such other Holder, and each such director, 

  

      

  

officer, employee, agent, partner and controlling Person of the foregoing,
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action,
in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement
(or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) was made in
such Registration Statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company in such Holder\'s Selling Securityholder Questionnaire); provided,
however, that the liability of each Holder hereunder shall be limited to the
net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of securities under such
Registration Statement.

  

 (c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.4 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give notice to the party required to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any claim as to which indemnification may be sought promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge thereof, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be subject to approval by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense if (i) representation of such Indemnified Party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such proceeding; and provided further that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article III, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such claim or any such litigation. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, may, without the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liabilities on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or litigation. 

  

 (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in case indemnification is unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of legal prohibition or otherwise), the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and such party\'s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such actions; provided, however, that, in any case, (i) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of any amount the public offering price of all securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration Statement, and (ii) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

  

 (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Parties and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities. 

  

       

 Section 3.6. _ _Information by Holder. The Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities included in any registration shall furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder or Holders and the distribution proposed by such Holder or Holders as the Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this Article III. 

  

 Section 3.7. _ _Transfer of Registration Rights. The rights contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof to cause the Company to register the Registrable Securities, and the other rights set forth in this Article III, may be assigned or otherwise conveyed by any Stockholder to any transferee of the Registrable Securities if the transfer was permitted under Article II. 

   

 Section 3.8. _ _Other Registration Rights. After the date hereof, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding, enter into any new agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would allow such holder or prospective holder to include such securities in any registration unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the Registrable Securities of the Holders that are included. 

   

 Section 3.9. _ _Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to: 

  

  

 (a) make and keep current public information available, within the meaning of Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act; and 

   

 (b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and Exchange Act; 

  

 (c) as long as any Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish in writing upon such Holder\'s written request a written statement by the Company that it has timely filed all reports as contemplated by the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.
