(the " _Base Amount_ "), as may be adjusted pursuant to _Sections 1.3(c)_ and
_1.5_.

 



 

(b) Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Shareholder shall deliver to Buyer good faith, written estimates of the
Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), the Indebtedness of the Company (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), the Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working
Capital_ "), and the Company Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses_ "), each as calculated in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles.

 



 

(c) The estimated closing payment (the " _Estimated Closing Payment_ ") will
be an amount equal to the Base Amount:

 



 

(i) _plus_ , the amount of the Estimated Cash;

 



 

(ii) _minus_ , the amount of the Estimated Indebtedness;

 



 

(iii) _plus_ , if the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital
Target, the amount of such excess;

 



 

(iv) _minus_ , if the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Target, the amount of such deficit;

 



 

(v) _minus_ , the amount of the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses; and

 



 

(vi) _minus_ , the amount of the Promissory Note Payment Amount.

 



 

(d) At Closing, Buyer will pay (or cause to be paid):

 



 

(i) an amount equal to seventy-one million eight hundred seventy-five thousand
United States Dollars ($71,875,000) (the " _Escrow Amount_ "), to be paid in
Canadian Dollars determined at the Transaction Exchange Rate, which represents
payment of a portion of the Purchase Price, to the Escrow Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a single bank account designated by
the Escrow Agent with such funds to be invested as Buyer, Shareholder and the
Escrow Agent mutually agree, to be held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement;

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Payment, _less_ the Escrow
Amount, to Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account or accounts as designated by Shareholder at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to the Promissory Note Payment Amount, to be paid by the
Company to the holder of the Promissory Note, Frind Enterprises Ltd.; and

 



 

(iv) an amount equal to the amount included in Company Transaction Expenses
for employee bonuses, to be paid by the Company to those employees, net of any
applicable withholding determined in accordance with _Section 1.6_, and in
such

 



      
 

 



 

allocations, as set forth in _Se_ _ction_ _ 1.3(d)_ _(iv)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, subject to adjustment prior to Closing to reflect any
such employees who are no longer employed by the Company.

 



 

1.4 _Closing Statement_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer will prepare a closing statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") showing its calculations of the Cash, Indebtedness, Working
Capital and Company Transaction Expenses (collectively, the " _PP Components_
"), in each case as of the Closing Time, and the Adjusted Closing Payment. The
PP Components will be calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles. As promptly as practicable, and in any event, within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Shareholder
the Closing Statement, together with supporting documentation reasonably
sufficient to confirm and support Buyers calculation of the PP Components and
the Adjusted Closing Payment.

 



 

(b) Shareholder and its accounting and legal representatives will be entitled
to reasonable access to the work papers related to the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the relevant books and records of the Company, and the
Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that it and its employees,
advisors and representatives who were involved in preparing the PP Components
or the Closing Statement are available to discuss, on reasonable advance
notice but as soon as reasonably practicable, the preparation of the Closing
Statement with Shareholder.

 



 

(c) If Shareholder agrees with Buyers calculation of the Adjusted Closing
Payment, the Closing Statement (including Buyers calculation of the Adjusted
Closing Payment) shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties, absent
fraud or manifest error. If Shareholder disagrees with Buyers calculation of
the Adjusted Closing Payment, Shareholder must deliver to Buyer, within forty-
five (45) days after the date Buyer delivered the Closing Statement and
supporting documentation to Shareholder as required by _Section 1.4(a)_, a
written description of such disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If
Shareholder fails to provide a Notice of Disagreement within such forty-five
(45)-day period, the Closing Statement (including Buyers calculation of the
Adjusted Closing Payment) shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties,
absent fraud or manifest error. Buyer and Shareholder will negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disagreement described in the Notice of Disagreement. If,
after a period of forty-five (45) days following the date on which the Notice
of Disagreement is delivered, Buyer and Shareholder have not resolved each
such disagreement by jointly in writing agreeing to the Closing Statement or
any revisions thereto, then either Buyer or Shareholder will be entitled to
submit such disagreements to the Resolution Accountants, with prior written
notice regarding such submission to the nonsubmitting Party.

 



 

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such written notice, Buyer
and Shareholder will each deliver to the Resolution Accountants a written
settlement offer setting forth its calculations of the PP Components
calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles and the
Adjusted Closing Payment (each, a " _Settlement Offer_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Buyer nor Shareholder may submit a Settlement Offer
that contains a proposal as to any PP Component that, in the case of a
proposal by Buyer, is more adverse to Shareholder as compared to the Closing
Statement, or, in the case of a proposal by Shareholder, is more adverse to
Buyer as compared to the position set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, but

 



      
 

 



 

in each case absent fraud or manifest error. The Resolution Accountants shall,
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, determine, on the basis of the
standards expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Transaction Accounting
Principles, which Partys Settlement Offer most accurately reflects the
Resolution Accountants determination of the PP Components calculated in
accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles and the Adjusted Closing
Payment contemplated hereby. Buyer will cause the Company to grant to the
Resolution Accountants reasonable access to the Company books and records
relating to the calculation of the PP Components. As set out above, the
Resolution Accountants will select one of the Settlement Offers within thirty
(30) days after the date on which the Resolution Accountants are engaged or as
soon thereafter as possible, and, absent fraud or manifest error, the
selection by the Resolution Accountants will be binding upon the Parties. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Resolution Accountants shall be borne by the
party whose Settlement Offer was not selected.

 



 

1.5 _Adjusted Closing Payment_.

 



 

(a) The adjusted closing payment (the " _Adjusted Closing Payment_ ") will be
an amount equal to the Base Amount:

 



 

(i) _plus_ , the amount of the Cash;

 



 

(ii) _minus_ , the amount of the Indebtedness of the Company;

 



 

(iii) _plus_ , if the Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target, the
amount of such excess;

 



 

(iv) _minus_ , if the Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target,
the amount of such deficit;

 



 

(v) _minus_ , the Company Transaction Expenses; and

 



 

(vi) _minus_ , the amount of the Promissory Note Payment Amount.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the
Adjusted Closing Payment in accordance with _Section 1.4_:

 



 

(i) if the Adjusted Closing Payment exceeds the Estimated Closing Payment,
Buyer will pay to Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the bank account or accounts designated by Shareholder pursuant to
_Section_ _ 1.3(d)_, the amount of such excess; or

 



 

(ii) if the Adjusted Closing Payment is less than the Estimated Closing
Payment, Shareholder and Buyer will deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such deficit to Buyer from the available balance of
the Escrow Amount and if the balance of the Escrow Amount is insufficient to
cover such payment, then Shareholder will pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account designated by Buyer, the
amount of any such shortfall.

 



 

1.6 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent required by the Code or applicable Law, Buyer shall be permitted
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable hereunder any amounts so
required to be deducted and withheld. Any amounts that are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Body shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Shareholder. The
Parties acknowledge that, except with respect to the employee bonus payments
to be paid by the Company in connection with the Closing, no withholding is
required from the Estimated Closing Payment or the Adjusted Closing Payment
under current applicable law, assuming the accuracy of the representation
contained in _Section 2.10(y)_ and delivery of the certificate described in
_Section 1.2(a)(viii)_.

 



 

1.7 _Foreign Exchange_. Except as may be specifically provided herein, all
amounts to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States Dollars. To the
extent any calculations of amounts to be paid (a) include amounts denominated
in Canadian Dollars or (b) are denominated in United States Dollars and
require conversion to Canadian Dollars, such amounts shall be converted using

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, and cooperate with each other in order to do, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law
and the Investment Canada Act) to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including: (i) causing the
preparation and filing of all necessary, proper or advisable filings, notices,
forms, applications and registrations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and the taking of such

 



      
 

 



 

actions as are necessary to obtain such consents from any Governmental Body
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents including under the Investment
Canada Act, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to resolve any objection
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Body and to

Governmental Body that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
(iii) taking all acts necessary to cause the conditions to the consummation of
this Agreement to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (iv) obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (v)

Bodies), penalty or other consideration to any Person for any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Governmental Body challenging any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents under any Antitrust Law or the
Investment Canada Act, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve (and
to avoid the institution of) any such proceeding. If, notwithstanding such
reasonable best efforts, any proceeding is instituted by any Governmental
Body, Buyer shall further use reasonable best efforts to contest such
proceeding until each such proceeding is resolved pursuant to a settlement or
a final non-appealable court order. Without limiting and in addition to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to take all such further action as may be necessary to
obtain any clearance relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement relating to the Investment Canada Act.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section

advisable to be made by any Party under any Antitrust Law and the Investment
Canada Act and with any investigation by a Governmental Body into the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents;

 



 

(ii) liaising with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before
the relevant Governmental Bodies and as to the contents of all communications
with such Governmental Bodies. In particular, no Party will make any
notification in relation to the transactions contemplated hereunder without
first providing the other Party with a copy of such notification in draft form
and giving such other Party a reasonable

 



       
 

 



 

opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Bodies, and such first Party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other Party in this respect;

analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto in

cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and other
proceedings by or before any Governmental Body challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing shall be deemed to require Buyer to (i) undertake or agree
to, or proffer to, divest, license, hold separate or subject to any other
Contract or arrangement any material business, business line, segment or
assets of the Buyer or of its Affiliates; or (ii) undertake or agree to take
any action that, after consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, places any limitation on Buyers ownership or operation of one or
more of the business, or the assets, of the Company, that would, or would be
reasonably likely to in the reasonable opinion of the Buyer, materially impair
the benefits sought to be derived by the Buyer from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Filing fees and all other fees and expenses required under the Antitrust
Laws and the Investment Canada Act shall be borne solely by Buyer. The parties
shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege in a manner so as to preserve any applicable
privilege. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, commercially
and/or competitively sensitive information and materials of a Party will be
provided to the other Party on an outside legal counsel-only basis while, to
the extent feasible, making a version in which the commercial and/or
competitively sensitive information has been redacted available to the other
Party.

and its Representatives to, (i) permit Buyer and its Representatives to have
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice, at Buyers
expense, to premises, properties, senior management personnel (including the
opportunity to discuss the affairs of the Company with such senior management
personnel), books, records, Contracts, documents and data of or pertaining to
each Company and (ii) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with copies of all
such books, records, Contracts, documents and data as Buyer may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, none of Shareholder nor the Company shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
reasonably be expected to (A) contravene any Law or (B) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other privilege or other immunity or protection from
disclosure of Shareholder or the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall only disclose, transfer or otherwise provide to the
Buyer information about identifiable individuals (" _Personal Information_ ")
that is necessary to determine whether to proceed with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and to complete it. The Buyer shall use and
disclose such Personal Information solely for purposes related to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer shall protect the
Personal Information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of
the information. If the Closing does not occur, the Buyer shall, at the
Companys request, return the Personal Information to the Company or
permanently and irrevocably destroy the Personal Information. After Closing,
the Buyer shall not use or disclose the Personal Information except in
accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

4.4 _Notice of Developments_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, a Party will notify the other Parties as promptly as practicable in
writing of any fact or condition developing after the date of this Agreement,
which, if existing, occurring or known as of the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be disclosed by Shareholder to Buyer hereunder, or vice
versa, and would constitute a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty of any Party in this Agreement (for greater certainty, regardless of
which Party had the obligation to disclose or which party would be in breach).
No such notification shall be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement for the purposes
of the termination rights contained in this Agreement or of determining
whether or not the conditions set forth in _Article V_ have been satisfied.
However, to the extent that, prior to Closing, the Company delivers one or
more supplements to the Company Disclosure Schedule, each such supplement will
be deemed to amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ has been
satisfied. Buyer may reasonably request, and Shareholder and the Company will
promptly provide, a consolidated Company Disclosure Schedule incorporating all
such amendments.

 



 

4.5 _Exclusivity_. Shareholder agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives, the Company, and the Companys Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry, proposal, offer or contact
from any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives)
relating to any transaction involving the sale of any equity interest or
assets of the Company or any acquisition, divestiture, merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, redemption, financing
or similar transaction involving the Company (in each case, an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "); or (b) participate in any discussion or negotiation regarding,
furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or
facilitate in any other manner any Acquisition Proposal. If any Person makes
an Acquisition Proposal, Shareholder will notify Buyer as promptly as
practicable of such Acquisition Proposal in reasonable detail.

 



 

4.6 _Litigation Support_. Following the Closing, if any Party is evaluating,
pursuing, contesting or defending against any proceeding in connection with
(a) the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or (b) any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or
prior to the Closing Date involving the Company, then upon the request of such
Party each other Party will reasonably cooperate with the requesting Party and
its counsel in the evaluation, pursuit, contest or defense, make reasonably
available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as may be reasonably necessary in connection therewith. The
requesting Party will reimburse each other Party for its out-of-pocket
expenses related to such cooperation, unless the requesting Party is entitled
to indemnification therefor under _Article VII_.

 



 

4.7 _Press Releases and Announcements_. Unless otherwise permitted by this
Agreement, none of the Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or make any
other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to
an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other Party,
except as may be required by applicable Law, or by the rules and regulations
of, or pursuant to any agreement with, the NASDAQ Stock Market. If a Party
determines that it is required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations
of, or pursuant to agreement with, any such exchange or market to publicly
disclose this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, such
Party shall, within a reasonable time before making any such public
disclosure, if practicable, consult with the other Party regarding such public
disclosure and seek confidential treatment for such information to be so
disclosed, as may be reasonably requested by any other Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer will prepare and will consult with Shareholder before
issuing, and give Shareholder a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, the press release or any public statement announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

4.8 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and
_Section_ ___4.8(b)_ __ shall govern the confidentiality obligations of the
parties thereafter. If, for any reason, the Closing is not consummated and
this Agreement is terminated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. _Section_ ___4.8(b)_ is
intended to be in addition to, and not replace, that Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to the period from the Effective Date through the date on which
this Agreement is terminated, and to the extent of any

 



      
 

 



 

inconsistency between the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 4.8(b)_
during such time period, the terms most protective of each partys
Confidential Information shall prevail. Upon the Closing, Shareholder
acknowledges and agrees that all Confidential Information of the Company shall
be treated as Confidential Information of Buyer for the purposes of _Section
4.8(b)_; _provided_ that for all purposes hereunder, prior to and following
the Closing, any information related to the Pre-Closing Reorganization shall
be treated as Confidential Information of the Shareholder.

 



 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the fifth (5th)
anniversary thereof, Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand (in such context, " _Receiving Party_ ") agrees that it shall, and shall
cause his or its Affiliates to, keep confidential and not use, disclose,
reveal, or divulge the Confidential Information (as defined below) of,
respectively, the Buyer, on the one hand, and Shareholder, on the other hand
(in such context, " _Disclosing Party_ "), to any Person for any purpose other
than in connection with the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Receiving Party further agrees that it shall
not use, disclose, reveal, or divulge and shall cause his or its Affiliates,
in each case directly, or indirectly, to use, disclose, reveal or divulge any
such Confidential Information to any Person except as required by Law or any
Governmental Body; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is
required by applicable Law or any Governmental Body, Receiving Party shall, to
the extent reasonably possible, provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Disclosing Party may
seek an appropriate protective order. Receiving Party shall inform its
Affiliates and Representatives of the confidential nature of such information
and the obligation to keep such information confidential, and shall take such
other actions as shall be reasonably required to cause such information to be
kept confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential
Information_ " means (a) the terms of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document, the documents and materials related to the Pre-Closing
Reorganization and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) the
discussions among the Parties and their Affiliates and representatives
regarding the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and the
documents and materials related to the Pre-Closing Reorganization, and (c) any
information with respect to Disclosing Party or its Affiliates, whether
obtained by Receiving Party obliged hereby prior to, at or after the date of
this Agreement and whether or not in accordance with, or in connection with
performing obligations under, any Transaction Documents or the documents and
materials related to the Pre-Closing Reorganization, including methods of
operation, customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs,
Technology, Intellectual Property, inventions, trade secrets, know-how,
Software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets
or other specialized information or proprietary matters, in each case that is
either (1) marked "confidential" or "proprietary" or with a similar
designation or (2) of a nature that a reasonable person would consider such
information to be confidential given the circumstances of its disclosure;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have the right

 



      
 

 



 

to disclose materials related to the Pre-Closing Reorganization to its
Representatives and in connection with any investigation, claim or proceeding
by a Governmental Body, including U.S. and Canadian tax authorities, after
providing five (5) Business Days prior written notice of any such disclosure
to the Company and the Shareholder so that the Company or the Shareholder may
have time to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the
right to disclose, in connection with the initial public offering of the Match
Group, (i) this Agreement (excluding the Company Disclosure Schedule) and any
summary descriptions of the terms and conditions contained herein, (ii) a
description of the Company, its operations and performance, and (iii) the
information contained in the Financial Statements as such information may be
audited pursuant to _Section 4.9_ (or pro forma financials based on the
information contained in the Financial Statements as such information may be
audited pursuant to _Section 4.9_), _provided_ that in each case, Buyer shall
consult with Shareholder and give Shareholder a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any such disclosure. Confidential Information does not
include, and Receiving Party shall not have an obligation hereunder with
respect to Disclosing Partys Confidential Information, that (i) is generally
available to the public on the date of this Agreement (ii) becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise
permissible hereunder or (iii) becomes available to Receiving Party on a non-
confidential basis from a source (other than from the Disclosing Party or any
of its Affiliates) which is not known to Receiving Party to be prohibited from
disclosing such information pursuant to a legal, contractual or fiduciary
obligation to Disclosing Party or its Affiliates, or information which is
developed by Receiving Party from such information. Any breach by an Affiliate
or Representative of Receiving Party of this _Section 4.8_ shall be deemed a
breach by Receiving Party of this _Section 4.8_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will this _Section 4.8_ or the Confidentiality
Agreement limit or otherwise restrict the right of a Receiving Party to
disclose such Confidential Information (x) to its and its Affiliates
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors to the extent
reasonably required to facilitate the negotiation, execution, delivery or
performance of the SPA and the Transaction Documents, (y) to any Governmental
Body or arbitrator to the extent reasonably required in connection with any
Claim relating to the enforcement of the SPA or any Transaction Document and
(z) in connection with its indemnification obligations under the SPA,
including the defense of any Third Party Claim.

 



 

4.9 _Audit of Financial Statements_. Shareholder agrees to cooperate, and
shall cause the Company and Shareholders other Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to cooperate, in any audit of the Companys
financial statements undertaken by accountants selected by Buyer, including
but not limited to complying with _Section 4.3_. Buyer shall be responsible
for the costs and expenses of any accountants selected to perform any audit of
the Companys financial statements. For the avoidance of doubt, any audited
financial statements of the Company will not have any authority in connection
with the calculation of the PP Components, which shall be handled in
accordance the Transaction Accounting Principles as contemplated by _Sections
1.4_ and _1.5_

 



 

4.10 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Shareholder shall timely prepare or shall cause to be timely prepared any
income Tax Returns of the Company for any taxable period that ends before or
on the Closing Date in a manner consistent with past practice, except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Shareholder shall deliver to
Buyer for its review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) a copy of each such Tax Return at least 30 days prior
to the due date thereof (taking into account extensions). Shareholder shall
consider such comments in good faith to the extent such

 



      
 

 



 

comments would affect any items that would carry over to tax periods after the
Closing Date. Shareholder shall not amend or revoke any such Tax Returns
unless required by Law or as a result of an audit. Shareholder shall timely
file or cause to be timely filed any such Tax Returns required to be filed on

timely file or cause to be timely filed any Tax Returns prepared by
Shareholder in accordance with this _Section 4.10(a)(i)_ that are required to
be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions); provided
that Buyer shall not be required to file any such Tax Return unless, with
respect to each item reflected on such Tax Return, there is at least a more
likely than not position for prevailing on the merits. In the event
Shareholder and Buyer disagree regarding the treatment of any item reflected
on such Tax Return, Buyer shall file such Tax Return if Shareholder provides
Buyer with a written opinion of McMillan LLP, Ernst and Young LLP or another
nationally recognized firm, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, confirming that there is at least a more likely than not position for
prevailing on the merits with respect to such item.

Buyer shall consider in good faith any such comments _provided_ that Buyer
shall reflect any such comments received from Shareholder regarding the
reporting of (x) the Pre-Closing Reorganization or (y) any other item
affecting the Tax liability of the Company for the portion of such Straddle
Period that is a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, if there is at least a
more likely than not position for prevailing on the merits (and any

the last sentence of _Section 4.10(a)(i)_).

 



 

(b) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) If any Governmental Body asserts a Claim in respect of Taxes, then the
party hereto first receiving notice of such Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , (A) in the case of such a notice first received by Buyer or the
Company following the Closing, written notice to Shareholder shall only be
required if such notice relates to Taxes for which Shareholder could be
responsible under this Agreement and (B) that the failure of such party to
give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its
obligations under _Article V_, except to the extent that the other party is
actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) Shareholder shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any
audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any
Governmental Body (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") in respect of the Company for any
taxable

Proceeding and receive copies of any written materials relating to such Tax
Proceeding received from the relevant Taxing Authority, and (E) Shareholder
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent such settlements, compromises
or abandonments could affect any Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period or
otherwise adversely impact Buyer.

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any Tax
Proceeding for a Straddle Period of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that

account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Buyer shall consult with
Shareholder and offer Shareholder an opportunity to comment before submitting

delayed, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on Shareholder.

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control (A) any Tax Proceeding
involving the Company (except to the extent otherwise set forth in _Section
4.10(b)(ii)_ or _(_ _iii_ _)_ ) and (B) any Tax Proceeding described in

provide to the other Party hereto such cooperation, documentation and
information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability

papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate or (y) ten (10) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable notice
and opportunity

 



      
 

 



 

to take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at such other
Partys own expense. Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available
on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

shall pay 50% of all Transfer Taxes imposed on or as a result of the Sale and
Purchase, together with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax
with respect thereto, and Shareholder and Buyer shall cooperate in timely
making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply
with the provisions of such Tax Laws.

 



 

(e) _Coordination_. The control of Tax Proceedings shall be governed by
_Section 4.10(b)_ and not by the provisions of _Section 7.5_.

 



 

4.11 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Buyer agrees that the Company and
Shareholder shall have the right at any time and from time to time prior to
the Closing to supplement and/or amend the Sections corresponding to the
representations and warranties contained in _Article II_ contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule in order to add information with respect to events
occurring after the Effective Date. No such supplement shall be evidence that
the representations and warranties in this Agreement are no longer true and
correct. Any such supplemental disclosure shall be (a) disregarded for
purposes of Article VII, and (b) deemed to have cured any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company or Shareholder in this
Agreement or in any other document delivered or to be delivered by Company or
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement for purposes of determining whether the
condition in _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_ has been satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such supplemental disclosure shall be disregarded in determining
whether the condition set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ has been satisfied. All
references to any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule that is
supplemented or amended as provided in this _Section 4.11_ will, for purposes
of determining whether the condition in _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_ has been
satisfied, be deemed to be a reference to such Section as so supplemented or
amended.

 



 

4.12 _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. The Company, Shareholder and, after the
Closing, the Buyer shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) complete the Pre-Closing Reorganization prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) subject to _Section 4.10(a)(i)_ hereof, take all filing positions
and do all such acts and things and file all such available elections,
designations, forms, returns and other things as may be reflected in the
reorganization plan referenced in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or otherwise required to give effect to the tax treatment specified
in _Section 4.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (provided that Buyer
shall not be required to take any such action unless such action is requested
in writing by Shareholder with reasonable specificity and reasonably in
advance of the date for taking such action), (iii) without restricting the
generality of the foregoing, with respect to the elections to be filed under
Subsection 83(2), 85, Part III or Part III.1 of the Tax Act, take all
necessary steps to file all applicable elections and returns in a timely
manner, and (iv) if any election is to be filed under Section 156 of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada) in accordance with Schedule 4.12, take all necessary
steps to file such election, provided that Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company) shall not be required to incur any
unreimbursed expenses in connection with any action described in clauses (ii)
through (iv) hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

4.13 _Termination of Related Party and Intercompany Arrangements_. At or prior
to the Closing, the Shareholder and the Company shall, and shall cause the
counterparties thereto to, terminate all related party and intercompany
arrangements, as identified on _Section 4.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule but excluding any arrangements contemplated in _Section 4.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

4.14 _Restrictive Covenants_. The parties agree that the restrictive covenants
referenced in this Agreement or any relevant restrictive covenant agreements
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder are
intended to help preserve the value of the Shares, and that no consideration
is allocable for the granting of such restrictive covenants, for income tax
purposes. If, however, any portion of the Purchase Price is deemed by a
relevant taxation authority to be in respect of a "restrictive covenant" as
that term is defined for purposes of the Tax Act, and such determination by
the relevant taxation authority is not successfully disputed by the
Shareholder at its option, then the parties agree that, upon request of the
Shareholder, such portion shall be treated for purposes of the Tax Act and
applicable Canadian provincial law in such a way so as to benefit from any
relief under section 56.4 of the Tax Act and will file the necessary joint
elections, provided that in no circumstances shall Buyer be obligated to pay
any additional consideration to the Shareholder for such covenants other than
as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the relevant restrictive
covenant agreement.

 



 

4.15 _Dividend Tax Elections and Designations._ The parties hereto acknowledge
that the Shareholder will have complete discretion to determine the amount of
any capital dividend paid or deemed to be paid by the Company, and eligible or
ineligible dividends paid or deemed to be paid by the Company as the case may
be, as part of the Pre-Closing Reorganization. In the event that the amount or
amounts so determined by the Shareholder to be capital dividends exceeds the
Companys capital dividend account immediately before the relevant time or
times, or the amounts determined in respect of eligible dividends would give
rise to an "excessive eligible dividend designation" for purposes of
subsection 89(1) of the Tax Act as the case may be, or the Canada Revenue
Agency asserts that the amounts determined by the Shareholder parties exceeds
the Companys capital dividend account immediately before the relevant time or
gives rise to an "excessive eligible dividend designation" as the case may be
(and the Shareholder does not dispute the assertion, or the assertion is
disputed but resolved on the basis that the amount determined so exceeds the
capital dividend account), then the Company shall, in respect of such capital
dividends, file an election under subsection 184(3) of the Tax Act to treat
such excess as a taxable dividend to avoid tax under Part III of the Tax Act
and, in respect of eligible or ineligible dividends as the case may be, shall
file an election under subsection 185.1(2) as appropriate to avoid tax under
Part III.1 of the Tax Act, and the relevant Shareholder party that received
the deemed or actual dividend hereby concurs in the filing of any such
election without any further act or formality. In the event that the Company
does file any such election under the Tax Act, then the Company may require
the relevant Shareholder party to, and such Shareholder party shall, provide
to the Canada Revenue Agency reasonable evidence of the relevant Shareholder
partys concurrence with the election.

 



 

4.16 _Tax Elections_. The parties agree that the Company will elect (and Buyer
will ensure that the Company does so elect), timely in accordance with
subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act, not to have the provisions of subsection
256(9) apply in respect of the acquisition of control of the Company arising
on the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

4.17 _Post-_ _Closing_ _Employment_. Markus Frind shall provide services to
the Company pursuant to the employment contract, by and among Markus Frind,
the Company and the Buyer, dated as of the date hereof and effective as of the
Closing Date (the " _Employment_ _Contract_ ") for at least six months
following the Closing Date.

aggregate, to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions

(b) by either Buyer or Shareholder if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before the date that is six (6) months after the signing date, January 13,

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
proximately caused any of conditions set forth in _Article V_ to fail to be
satisfied and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of
this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by either Buyer or Shareholder if an injunction or order issued by any
Governmental Body of competent authority permanently restrains or prohibits
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such injunction or
order becomes final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section _

_provided_ , _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

asserting the right to terminate under this _Section 6.1(c)_; or

 



 

(d) by (i) Buyer, upon prior written notice to Shareholder, if there has been
a material breach or failure to perform by Shareholder or the Company of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the
Closing and such breach or failure to perform has not been waived by Buyer or

that any indemnity claim made by a Party prior to the end of such survival
period shall survive until such claim is fully paid or finally and completely

(b) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation in any Transaction
Document.

 



 

7.4 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Except (1) for any breach of a Fundamental Representation, (2) for any
breach of a representation or warranty set forth in _Section 2.10_ (Taxes) or
(3) fraud (including intentional misrepresentation, but excluding negligent
misrepresentation), neither the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor Shareholder
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive any indemnification payment
with respect to Indemnification Claims made under _Section 7.2(a)_ or

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7.3(a)_, as the case may be, unless:

 



 

(i) any such individual claim for Losses exceeds fifty-seven thousand five
hundred United States Dollars ($57,500); and

 



 

(ii) the aggregate amount of all claims (including claims that do not exceed
the dollar threshold in _Section 7.4(a)(ii)_) exceeds four million three
hundred twelve thousand five hundred United States Dollars ($4,312,500) (at
which point Shareholder will be only obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against the amount of Losses that exceed such
amount).

 



 

(b) Any Person against whom an Indemnification Claim is being asserted (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not be obligated to defend and hold harmless any
Person claiming indemnification under this _Article VII_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), or otherwise be liable to such Indemnified Party, with respect to
any Indemnification Claim made by the Indemnified Party after the expiration
of the Survival Period, except that indemnity may be sought after the
expiration of the Survival Period if an Indemnification Claim has been
delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the Survival
Period.

 



 

(c) The aggregate liability of Shareholder under _Section 7.2_ for any
Indemnification Claim and all Indemnification Claims shall be limited to
seventy-one million eight hundred seventy-five thousand United States Dollars
($71,875,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ that liability of Shareholder may
exceed the Cap, but shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the
Purchase Price if, such Indemnification Claim arises from (i) any breach of
any of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) any breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 2.10_ (Taxes), (iii) any matter contemplated
by _Section 7.2_ _(c)_ and _provided further_ that liability of Shareholder
for fraud (including intentional misrepresentation, but excluding negligent
misrepresentation) shall be unlimited.

 



 

(d) Any payment an Indemnifying Party is obligated to make to any Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be satisfied, in cash, _first_ ,
to the extent there are sufficient Escrow Funds, from the escrow account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and, _second_ , to the
extent the Escrow Funds are insufficient to pay any remaining sums due and
owing, then Shareholder shall be required to pay all of such additional sums
due and owing to the Buyer Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such
Indemnification Claim unless such Indemnifying Party delivers a Dispute Notice
in accordance with the terms of _Section 7.5(b)_. On the Escrow Release Date,
Shareholder and Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint instructions
instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrow Funds, together with any
and all interest and income accrued thereon, on the Escrow Release Date to
Shareholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Shareholder; _provided_ that the joint instruction shall not
require the Escrow Agent to distribute any amounts subject to claims for which
Buyer delivered a written notice to an Indemnifying Party in accordance with
_Section 7.4(b)_ and that remain pending and unresolved on the Escrow Release
Date, until such claims are finally resolved or judicially determined (at
which time any remaining Escrow Funds in respect of such claims, to the extent
not payable to Buyer, shall be released to Shareholder, together with any and
all interest and income accrued thereon, per joint instructions to the

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Agent).

 



 

(e) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, the amount of
any Losses otherwise recoverable under this _Article VII_ with respect to a
particular claim shall be:

 



 

(i) reduced by the amounts that are recoverable by an Indemnified Party as
proceeds of insurance or from third parties in respect of such Losses _minus_
the costs and expenses incurred by an Indemnifying Party in recovering such
insurance, and

 



 

(ii) reduced to take into account any net Tax benefit actually realized by an
Indemnified Party or an Affiliate thereof at any time following the Closing
Date up to and including the time of payment of the related indemnified
amount, which Tax benefit arises from the payment of any such indemnified
amount or the Losses giving rise to such payment (excluding any Tax benefit
arising from the Pre-Closing Reorganization).

 



 

(iii) In the event any amounts recoverable under insurance policies are not
received before any Indemnification Claim is paid pursuant to this _Article
VII_, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any insurance policies maintained by the Company prior to
the Closing to the extent available, and, in the event the Buyer Indemnified
Parties receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied
_first_ , to reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for their out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and all reasonable
and documented costs of collections, deductibles, expenses of recoveries or
premiums incurred directly in connection therewith) expended in pursuing such
recovery, _second_ , to compensate the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any
Losses for which Shareholder Indemnifying Parties did not provide
indemnification, _third_ , to refund any payments made by Buyer or
Indemnifying Parties which would not have been so paid had such recovery been
obtained prior to such payment, and _fourth_ , any excess to Shareholder
Indemnifying Parties.

 



 

(f) The Parties sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to
any and all claims (other than injunctions or other equitable remedies
pursuant to _Section 8.10_, or claims of, or causes of action arising from,
fraud (including intentional misrepresentation, but excluding negligent
misrepresentation)) relating to this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VII_.

 



 

(g) Except to the extent included in the definition of "Losses", and except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein, none of the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for any indirect, incidental, special,
exemplary or punitive damages, unless (i) such damages are foreseeable or the
damaged Party has advised the other Party of the possibility of such damages,
and (ii) such damages are awarded to a Person in an indemnifiable Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(h) No Indemnified Party hereunder shall be entitled to double recovery for

Agreement.

 



 

(i) If the Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses

or the Buyer Indemnified Party against such third party, and the Buyer will,
and will cause each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to, reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights and
remedies against such third party.

 



 

7.5 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder, within the
relevant limitation period provided for in _Section 7.1_ above, shall give
written notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") of any Indemnification Claim (i) in
the case of an Indemnification Claim against Buyer, to Buyer and (ii) in the
case of an Indemnification Claim against Shareholder, to Shareholder,
reasonably promptly, but in any event (A) prior to expiration of the Survival
Period and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against
an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of written
notice of a legal process relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or liability that
the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party, unless, and then
only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the
Indemnifying Partys ability to defend or resolve such Indemnification Claim
is prejudiced thereby. Any such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances on which the asserted Indemnification Claim
is based and specify the amount of such Indemnification Claim if then
ascertainable. Any Claim Notice relating to a Third Party Claim shall be
accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third
Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served, any written demand or any other document or instrument.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of any
such Indemnification Claim pursuant hereto to give notice to the Indemnified
Party disputing such Indemnification Claim or the claimed amount set forth
therein (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Absent delivery of a Dispute Notice or
affirmative indication of agreement during such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall automatically be deemed to have agreed to the amount
or method of determination set forth in the Indemnification Claim. All
disputed Indemnification Claims shall be resolved by Buyer and Shareholder, in
accordance with either (i) a mutual agreement among Buyer and Shareholder,
which shall be memorialized in writing, or (ii) the final determination of a
final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice for indemnity from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 7.4_ in respect of a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, upon written notice given to the Indemnified Party
delivered within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice relating to
a Third Party Claim, to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party
Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense, but shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

assume control of such defense (which shall be controlled by the Indemnified
Party) and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if (i) in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Partys
outside counsel, a conflict, or potential conflict, of interests exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
such Third Party Claim, or (ii) the Indemnification Claim relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, or the Indemnification Claim seeks an injunction or similar
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall select counsel (and local counsel, as
necessary) to conduct the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
defend or handle such Third Party Claim in such manner as is reasonable under
the circumstances and shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably apprised of
the status of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior express written consent of the Indemnified Party, (A)
consent to a settlement of, compromise or discharge of, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of judgment does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid
all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (except as otherwise provided in
such judgment). The Indemnified Party shall make available all information and
assistance reasonably available and necessary for the defense of the Third
Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ ___7.5(d)_ , the Indemnified Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditional or delayed), agree to a
settlement of any Third Party Claim that is being defended and handled by the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not give written notice to the Indemnified
Party within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has
elected to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, select counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to defend or handle such
Third Party Claim in consultation with the Indemnifying Party and in a manner
that is reasonable under the circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party timely apprised of the
status of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to a
settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment to any Third Party
Claim or demand for which it is seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying
Party or admit to any liability with respect to such claim or demand without
the prior express written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may
be granted or denied in the Indemnifying Partys sole discretion. If the
Indemnified Party defends or handles such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party and shall be entitled to
participate in but not control the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
purposes of determining the failure of any representations or warranties to be
true and correct or the breach of any covenants and agreements, and
calculating Losses or a partys indemnification obligation hereunder, any
materiality or similar qualifications in the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall be disregarded.

 



 

7.6 _Duty to Mitigate_. Each Indemnified Party shall use, and shall cause all
other Indemnified Parties to use, commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
or otherwise reduce the amount of Losses that it incurs in connection with any
matter with respect to which it is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified,
compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article VII_ upon and after
becoming aware of any such matter that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to Losses, including taking commercially reasonable measures to attempt
to recover from any third parties alleged to be responsible for such Losses
and any insurance proceeds available to offset such Losses under insurance
policies maintained by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , it
being understood that the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by an
Indemnifying Party in complying with this _Section _ _7.6_ shall be included
within the definition of Losses.

 



 

7.7 _R_ _emedies; Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth in this
_Article VII_ and _Section 8.10_, no Party shall have recourse whatsoever
under the Transaction Documents against any officers, directors, Affiliates or
agents of the other Parties (including for such purposes, the officers,
directors, Affiliates or agents of any Affiliate of a Party). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this
_Article VII_, _Section 8.10_, Section 6(b) of that certain Selling
Shareholders Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement,
by and among Markus Frind, the Company and the Buyer, dated as of the date
hereof and effective as of the Closing Date (the " _Confidentiality, Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement_ "), and Section 14 of the
Employment Contract, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and
Shareholder, on behalf of himself and his Affiliates, each hereby fully and
irrevocably waives any right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against such
officers, directors, Affiliates or agents relating to any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by any of them arising from, based upon, related to, or
associated with the Transaction Documents the transactions contemplated
thereby (including any breach, termination or failure to consummate such
transactions) in each case whether based on contract, tort, strict liability
other laws or otherwise and whether by piercing of the corporate veil, by
claim on behalf of or by a Party hereto or other Person or otherwise.

 



 

7.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Parties hereto agree to
treat for all income Tax purposes all indemnification payments made pursuant
to this _Article VII_ hereunder as adjustments to the Purchase Price payable
under this Agreement, and to take no position contrary thereto in any Tax
Return or audit or examination by, or proceeding before, any Taxing Authority,
except as otherwise required by a change in Law or a "determination" as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation and
execution of each Transaction Document, and the consummation of the

8.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

8.4 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents, Company Disclosure
Schedule, and Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and undertakings,

8.5 _Amendments; Assignment; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived only by an instrument in writing
duly executed by Buyer, the Company and Shareholder. Any such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver shall be for such period and subject to
such conditions as shall be specified in the instrument effecting the same and
shall be binding upon the Parties, and any such waiver shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the purposes for which given. This Agreement
shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior
written consent of Buyer or Shareholder, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_
, Buyer may assign any or all of its rights or interests, or delegate any or
all of its obligations, in this Agreement to (a) any successor to Buyer, any
successor to the Company, or any acquirer of a material portion of the
businesses or assets of Buyer or the Company, in each case after the Closing;
(b) one or more of Buyers Affiliates, or (c) any bona fide lender to Buyer,
the Company or any of their Affiliates as security for obligations to such
lender; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment or grant of security
interest will relieve or release Buyer from any of its Liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement. No failure on the part of any Party to
exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to,
any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of any such right, remedy, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in this Agreement are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by applicable Law.

intended to or shall confer upon any other Person not a party to this
Agreement any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (z) agrees that it will not bring any Claim relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) the defense
of sovereign immunity, (b) any Claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this _Section 8.7_, (c) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law that (i) the proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such proceeding is improper and (iii)

ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (1) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (2) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



 

8.8 _Headings; Construction_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
(a) the terms "including" and "include" shall be deemed to be followed by the
terms "without limitation," (b) the terms "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereto" or "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and (c) references

all references in _Article II_ and _Article III_ to any Law shall be deemed
to refer to such Law as enacted prior to the Effective Date; however, for each
supplemental Company Disclosure Schedule delivered, the deemed date for such
Law in _Article II_ will be the

 



      
 

 



 

date of such supplement. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is required to be done pursuant to
this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded and, if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Unless
the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement (i) to Articles,
Sections, exhibits and schedules mean the Articles and Sections of, and the
exhibits and schedules attached to or accompanying, this Agreement and (ii) to
an agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof. The schedules and exhibits
referred to in this Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in the
schedules and exhibits referred to in this Agreement shall have the meanings
set forth in this Agreement. Titles to Articles and headings of Sections are
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the fact that this Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the
Parties, each Party confirms that both it and its counsel have reviewed,
negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding
of the Parties. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against either Party. Any reference to
any federal, state or provincial, local or foreign Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance.

 



 

8.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different
Parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. To expedite the process of
entering into this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that Transmitted Copies
of this Agreement will be equivalent to original documents until such time as
original documents are completely executed and delivered. " _Transmitted
Copies_ " will mean copies that are reproduced or transmitted via email,
photocopy, facsimile, electronic communications by portable document format
(.pdf) or other process of complete and accurate reproduction and
transmission, each of which shall be deemed an original.

 



 

8.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties
will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at Law.

 



 

8.11 _Advisors_.

 



 

(a) Buyer (i) waives and will not assert, and will cause each of its
subsidiaries

 



      
 

 



 

(including, after the Closing, the Company and its subsidiaries) to waive and
not assert, any conflict of interest relating to Advisors representation
after the Closing of the Shareholder or any of their affiliates in any matter
involving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
litigation, arbitration, mediation, or other proceeding), and (ii) consents
to, and will cause each of its subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
Company and its subsidiaries) to consent to, any such representation, even
though in each case (x) the interests of the Shareholder or any subsidiary may
be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company, or any of their respective
subsidiaries, (y) Advisors may have represented the Company or its subsidiary
in a substantially related matter, or (z) Advisors may be handling other
ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company, or any of their respective
subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between
Buyer, the Company or any of its subsidiaries and a third party (other than
Shareholder or any of their Affiliates) after the Closing, then the Company or
its subsidiary, to the extent applicable, may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by the Advisors.

 



 

(b) Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its subsidiaries), that from and
after Closing (a) the attorney-client privilege, all other evidentiary
privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client
Communications belong to Shareholder and will not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer, the Company, or any of their subsidiaries, and (b) Shareholder will
have the exclusive right to control, assert, or waive the attorney-client
privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client
confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client Communications.
