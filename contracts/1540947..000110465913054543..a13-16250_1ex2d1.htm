defined below)) and material pipelines, equipment, compressors and other
tangible personal property, data and Intellectual Property, used, leased,
licensed or held for use by Sunrise for the conduct of its business. As of the
date hereof, Sunrise has valid and indefeasible title, and at the Closing
Sunrise will have, valid and indefeasible title to the property and Easements
included on _Sunrise Disclosure Schedule 4.11(a)_ (collectively, the " _Real
Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens).
Sunrise has made available to EQM true, correct and complete copies of all
agreements relating to the Real Property, including all modifications,
amendments, supplements, waivers, side letters thereto, title abstracts, title
opinion letters and the like (collectively, the " _Real Property Agreements_
"). All Real Property Agreements (i) are valid and enforceable, except as the
enforceability thereof may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws of general applicability affecting the rights of creditors
generally or principles of equity and (ii) grant all the material rights
purported to be granted thereby and all rights necessary thereunder for the
current operation of Sunrises business, except where the failure of any such
Real Property Agreement to be valid and enforceable or to grant the rights
purported to be granted thereby or necessary thereunder would not reasonably
be expected to materially impair the conduct of Sunrises business as
currently conducted.

 



 

(b) The real and tangible personal property listed on _Sunrise Disclosure
Schedule 4.11(a)_ include all real property and tangible personal property
that are necessary for Sunrise to conduct its operations in substantially the
same manner as currently being conducted. No event of default by Sunrise
presently exists under any Real Property Agreement. Sunrise has not received
notice of default under any material Real Property Agreement. Sunrise has
fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with respect to the Real
Property Agreements. No event

 



      
 

 



 

has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow
revocation or termination of any material Real Property Agreement or would
result in any impairment of any material rights of a holder under any
easements, rights of way, memorandum of easements, permits, servitudes,
licenses, leasehold estates, including, without limitation, leases, subleases
and occupancy agreements, any instruments creating an interest in real
property, and similar rights related to the Real Property (collectively, "
_Easements_ ") used in connection with Sunrises business. The map attached as
_Sunrise Disclosure Schedule 4.11(b)_ accurately depicts the entire route of
Sunrises natural gas transmission lines. The entire route of such natural gas
transmission lines is subject to Easements, and there are no gaps (including
any gap arising as a result of any breach of the terms of an Easement) in the
Easements, individually or in the aggregate, other than gaps that would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair the conduct of Sunrises business
as currently conducted.

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of Sunrise, there is no action pending or threatened for
eminent domain or for condemnation of any material part of the Real Property
used and necessary for the conduct of the business of Sunrise, as currently
conducted, by any Governmental Authority or other Person.

Property is in violation of any of the recorded covenants, conditions,
restrictions, reservations, easements or agreements applicable to the Real
Property.

 



 

(e) Sunrise has not received any written notice of, nor to the knowledge of
Sunrise, has a request or demand been otherwise made for, Sunrise to undertake
renovations, repairs or construction work at any portion of the Real Property.

alterations or maintenance that may be currently necessary for the operation
and use of the pipelines, equipment and compressors located on the Real
Property.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Condition of Sunrise Assets_.

 



 

(a) The Sunrise Assets have been maintained and repaired in the same manner as
a prudent operator would maintain and repair such assets and have been used by
Sunrise in the ordinary course of business and remain as of the date hereof in
suitable and adequate condition for such continued use excluding normal wear
and tear. The Sunrise Assets are adequate to conduct Sunrises natural gas
transmission business substantially in accordance with past practice, in
compliance with any material Applicable Law or requirements of a Governmental
Authority, and, to the Knowledge of Holdings and Sunrise, will be adequate to
conduct the natural gas transmission business after the compression expansion
at the Jefferson Compressor Station that is expected to be completed in the
third quarter of 2014.

infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property
of any third party. All Intellectual Property owned by Sunrise, if any, is
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Neither the
execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will, with or without notice or lapse of
time, result in, or give any other Person the right or option to cause or
declare, a breach or termination of, or cancellation or reduction in, rights
of Sunrise under any contract providing for the license of any Intellectual
Property to Sunrise, except for any such terminations, cancellations or
reductions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Sunrise
Material Adverse Effect. There is no Intellectual Property-related action,
suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, notice or complaint pending or
threatened by any third party before any court or tribunal (including, without
limitation, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent
authority anywhere in the world) relating to Sunrise or its operations, nor
has any claim or demand been made by any third party that alleges any
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of
any third party, or unfair competition or trade practices by Sunrise. Sunrise
has taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of all material
trade secrets.

at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or that is necessary to
correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules or in any representation
or warranty of Holdings, Sunrise, EQM or Equitrans, as applicable, which has
been rendered inaccurate thereby promptly following discovery thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party may supplement the information set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ following
the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon the providing of any
supplement permitted to be provided under this _Section 5.3(c)_, the Sunrise
Disclosure Schedules or the Equitrans Disclosure Schedules, as applicable,
shall be treated as being amended with respect to such supplemented
information; _provided_ , _however_ , no such supplement shall have any effect
for purposes of determining (i) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_, the compliance by Holdings, Sunrise, EQM or Equitrans with
any covenant set forth herein or for purposes of either partys right to
terminate this Agreement under _Article VII_ or (ii) the entitlement of a
party to indemnification under _Article VIII_.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Confidentiality_. Except as required by Applicable Law, including
in connection with the Offering, each of the parties shall hold, and shall

Section 5.5 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, and to cause their Affiliates to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain from

Authorities and other Persons all notices, as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, (ii) promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement required
under any Applicable Law, and (iii) have vacated, lifted, reversed or

enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal or otherwise restricts or
prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the parties hereto shall permit each other reasonably to
participate in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or cause of
action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall not settle or compromise any such claim, suit
or cause of action without EQMs and Holdingss written consent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither party shall be
required by this _Section 5.5_ to take or agree to undertake any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other
arrangement, that would (A) require the divestiture of any material assets of
EQM, Holdings (except for the Membership Interests pursuant to this Merger) or
any of their respective Affiliates, or (B) limit in any material respect EQMs
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control,
Equitrans or any of its assets or businesses or any of EQMs or its
Affiliates other assets or businesses.

 



 

(b) Without limitation to the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, Sunrise and
EQM shall give promptly such notice to third parties and obtain such third
party consents and estoppel certificates as the other party may in its
reasonable discretion deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The
parties shall cooperate and assist one another in giving such notices and
obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no party shall have any obligation to give any guarantee or other
material consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice,
consent or estoppel certificate or consent to any material change in the terms
of any agreement or arrangement.

 



 

(c) None of the parties shall, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Authority to, or represent to a Governmental
Authority that it will, delay or not consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of EQM or Holdings, as the case may be, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and subject
to any confidentiality restrictions of such Governmental Authority, each party
shall (x) promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that
party from any Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law and
subject to any confidentiality restrictions of such Governmental Authority,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written

 



      
 

 



 

communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments, (y) not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and (z) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence and written communications between them and their Affiliates
and their respective representatives on one hand, and any such Governmental
Authority or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall promptly
notify the other parties in writing of any pending or, to the Knowledge of
such party, threatened proceeding or investigation by any Governmental
Authority or any other person (i) challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material
damages in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (ii) seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. None of EQM, Equitrans, Holdings or
Sunrise, nor any of their Representatives will issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, without the prior
written consent of EQM GP, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
securities exchange on which the securities of a party are listed for trading,
and in which case, the party required to issue such release shall provide EQM
GP with reasonable advance notice prior to making any such disclosure, and
shall consult with the other party regarding the form and content of such
required disclosure.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Equitrans Lease_. Effective at Closing all obligations of
Equitrans and Sunrise under the Equitrans Lease shall be terminated.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Acknowledgements_. Each of EQM and Equitrans, on the one hand,
and Holdings and Sunrise, on the other hand, acknowledges that they have
relied on the representations and warranties of the other party expressly and
specifically set forth in this Agreement, including, in the case of EQM and
Equitrans, the Sunrise Disclosure Schedules as they exist on the date hereof
and attached hereto, and, in the case of Holdings and Sunrise, the Equitrans
Disclosure Schedules as they exist on the date hereof and attached hereto.
Such representations and warranties constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto understand,
acknowledge and agree that all other representations and warranties of any
kind or nature expressed or implied are specifically disclaimed.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Assistance and Cooperation_. EQM and Holdings agree to furnish or cause
to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
Sunrise as is reasonably requested by EQM, Holdings or any Affiliate for the
filing of any Tax Returns, for the preparation of any audit, and for the
prosecution or defense of any Tax claim. EQM and Holdings agree that each
shall preserve and keep all books and records with respect to Taxes and Tax
Returns of Sunrise

 



      
 

 



 

in such partys possession as of the Closing Date, or as later come into such
partys possession, until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the
other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
assistance. Any information obtained under this Section 5.9 shall be held
confidential by the receiving party in the same manner as it holds
confidential its own similar information, except (i) as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding or (ii) with the consent of EQM and
Holdings.

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties,
recording, and similar Taxes (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Merger and the transfer of Merger Consideration pursuant
thereto shall be borne equally by EQM and Holdings. EQM and Holdings shall
cooperate in filing all necessary Tax Returns and timely pay all such Transfer
Taxes as required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Tax Allocation and Indemnification_. Except as provided in _Section
5.9(b)_, Holdings shall retain responsibility for (and shall be entitled any
refunds with respect to), and shall indemnify EQM for, all Taxes related to
the Sunrise Assets attributable to taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), and EQM shall assume
responsibility for (and shall be entitled any refunds with respect to), and
shall indemnify Holdings for, all Taxes related to the Sunrise Assets
attributable to taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date (the " _Post-
Closing Period_ "). In the case of any Taxes related to the Sunrise Assets
that are payable for any taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (any " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Taxes
attributable to the period of time prior to the Closing Date (a) in the case
of any property, ad valorem, or similar Taxes, shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on (and
including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of all other Taxes, shall be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable as computed on a interim
closing-of-the-books basis if the relevant Tax period ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided,
regardless of which party is responsible for Taxes under this _Section 5.9_,
Holdings shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Authority of all
Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Period (and shall file all such Tax
Returns), and EQM shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental
Authority of all Taxes with respect to any Post-Closing Period (and shall file
all such Tax Returns). Holdings shall deliver to EQM within thirty (30) days
of filing copies of all Tax Returns filed by Holdings after the Closing Date
relating to Sunrise, the Sunrise Assets or operations and any supporting
documentation provided by Holdings to taxing authorities, excluding Tax
Returns related to income tax, franchise tax, or other similar Taxes.

 



 

(e) _Tax Treatment and Related Covenants_.

 



 

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.9(e)_, the parties
acknowledge that the transactions described in this Agreement are properly
characterized

 



      
 

 



 

as transactions described in Sections 721(a) and 731 of the Code and agree to
file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment.

 



 

(ii) The Cash Amount and any Deferred Consideration shall be treated (A) as a
"debt-financed transfer" to Holdings under Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-5(b) to the extent the cash is traceable under the principles of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.163-8T to Holdingss allocable share,
determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(b)(2), of indebtedness
of EQM, (B) as a reimbursement of Holdingss preformation expenditures with
respect to the Sunrise Assets and any Transportation Agreement within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d) to the extent applicable,
and (C) as the proceeds of a sale by Holdings of the Sunrise Assets and any
Transportation Agreement to EQM to the extent clauses (A) and (B), or any
other exceptions to the "disguised sale" rules under Section 707 and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, are inapplicable. It is the intention of the
parties that the reimbursement described in clause (B) of the preceding
sentence be divided between the Cash Amount and the Deferred Consideration as
follows: a portion of each of the Cash Amount and the Deferred Consideration
equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of Holdings expenditures qualifying for
the exception to the disguised sale rules under Treasury Regulations Section
1.707-4(d) (after taking into account all applicable limitations under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d)) shall be treated as paid to reimburse
such expenditures. For a period of four (4) years, except with the prior
written consent of Holdings, EQM will not, and EQM has no current plans to,
make any payment that would reduce the outstanding principal balance of
indebtedness of EQM, other than with the proceeds of a successor debt that (A)
qualifies as, and is treated by EQM as, a continuation of the debt repaid
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(c), and (B) is treated as allocable
to Holdings under the principles of the debt-financed transfer exception to
the disguised sale rules provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(b)
to the extent the reduced balance of the repaid debt was so allocated. The
parties acknowledge that Sunrise and Holdings are disregarded for federal
income tax purposes as entities apart from EQT Corporation; accordingly,
references to Holdings and Sunrise in this _Section 5.9(e)_ include EQT
Corporation as the context requires.

 



 

(iii) Except with the prior written consent of Holdings, EQM agrees to act at
all times in a manner consistent with this intended treatment of the Cash
Amount and any Deferred Consideration, including, if required, disclosing the
distribution of the Cash Amount or any Deferred Consideration in accordance
with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-3(c)(2).

 



 

(f) _Cooperation Regarding Allocation of Purchase Price_. To the extent that
any portion of the Merger Consideration is treated as received pursuant to a
sale pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-3, Holdings and EQM shall
cooperate to prepare an allocation of the Merger Consideration among the
various classes of the Sunrise Assets in accordance with and as provided by
Section 1060 of the Code. The parties agree that, except as otherwise required
by Applicable Law, any Tax Returns or other tax information they may file or
cause to be filed with any Government Authority shall be prepared and filed
consistently with any such agreed upon allocation. The parties agree that, to
the extent required by Applicable Law, they will each properly prepare and
timely file Form 8594 in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Like-Kind Exchange_. Any party to this Agreement may elect to structure
this transaction as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to any or all of the
Sunrise Assets (a " _Like-Kind Exchange_ ") at any time prior to the Closing
Date. In order to effect a Like-Kind Exchange, a non-electing party shall
cooperate and do all acts as may be reasonably required or requested by the
party electing for a Like-Kind Exchange with regard to effecting such Like-
Kind Exchange, including, but not limited to, permitting such Party to assign
its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (" _QI_ ") of such
partys choice in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) or executing additional escrow instructions, documents,
agreements or instruments to effect an exchange. EQM reserves the right, at or
prior to Closing, to assign its rights or a portion thereof under this
Agreement with respect to any or all of the Sunrise Assets to EQMs Qualified
Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in Revenue
Procedure 2000-37) (" _QEAT_ ") in connection with effecting a Like-Kind
Exchange. Holdings and EQM acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial
assignment of this Agreement to a QI or QEAT shall not release either Holdings
or EQM from, or expand, any of their respective liabilities and obligations to
each other under this Agreement. The party not participating in the Like-Kind
Exchange shall not be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any
additional obligations in its sale or purchase, as applicable, of the Sunrise
Assets if such costs are the result of the other partys Like-Kind Exchange,
and the party electing to consummate the sale as a Like-Kind Exchange agrees
to hold harmless and indemnify the other party from and against all costs,
expenses, claims, losses and liabilities, if any, resulting from the Like-Kind
Exchange.

 



 

(h) _Disposition of Assets_. EQM represents that it has no present intention
to sell or otherwise dispose of any material portion of the assets acquired
pursuant to the Merger in a taxable transaction for federal income tax
purposes. In the event that, within seven (7) years following the Merger, EQM
desires to effect a disposition of a material portion of the assets acquired
pursuant to the Merger in a manner that results in a material increase to the
tax liability of Holdings resulting from the allocation of income or gain
pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code (a " _Material Disposition Transaction_
"), such a Material Disposition Transaction would be required to be approved
by an independent committee appointed for such purpose by the EQM GP Board of
Directors.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Assignment of Cash_. On or prior to the Closing, Sunrise shall
assign to Holdings all cash balances of Sunrise on hand immediately prior to
the Closing (but no other working capital assets).

 



 

Section 5.11 _Conflicts Committee Approval_. No proposed firm transportation
agreements for capacity on the Sunrise Assets that are to become effective
during the Measurement Period and that will have an average daily quantity
reserved for less than seven (7) years will become a Transportation Agreement
unless approved by the Conflicts Committee.

warranties set forth in _Section 4.11_ (a " _Title Representation Breach_ ")

given by the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to
the party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
prior to such time.

 



 

(b) The aggregate liability of Holdings under _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ other than

(d) No claims may be made against Holdings for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate dollar amount of the Adverse
Consequence suffered or incurred by the EQM Protected Parties exceeds
$250,000, after which Holdings shall be liable for the full amount of such
claims in excess of $250,000, subject to the limitations of _Section 8.2(b)_.

which EQM shall be liable for the full amount of such claims in excess of
$250,000, subject to the limitations of Section 8.2(c).

 



 

(f) In no event shall Holdings be obligated to the EQM Protected Parties under
_Section 8.1(a)_ for any Adverse Consequence to the extent (i) any insurance
proceeds are realized by the EQM Protected Parties, such correlative benefit
to be net of any incremental insurance premium that becomes due and payable by
the EQM Protected Parties as a result of such claim, (ii) any amounts are
recovered by the EQM Protected Parties from third persons, or (iii) any
amounts may be recovered from customers under Equitrans tariff filed with the

(g) In no event shall EQM be obligated to the Holdings Protected Parties under

benefit to be net of any incremental insurance premium that becomes due and
payable by the Holdings Protected Parties as a result of such claim, (ii) any
amounts are recovered by the Holdings Protected Parties from third persons, or
(iii) any amounts may be recovered from customers under Equitrans tariff

otherwise) to the Holdings Protected Parties after the Effective Time for any
Adverse Consequences owed by Sunrise prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnified Party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this _Article VIII_, it will
provide notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party, specifying the
nature of and specific basis for such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Article VIII_ to the contrary, a delay by the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_, except to the extent that such failure
shall have caused actual prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the applicable claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control all aspects of the
defense of (and any counterclaims with respect to) any claims brought against
the Indemnified Party that are covered by the indemnification under this
_Article VIII_, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, the
determination of whether to appeal any decision of any court and the
settlement of any such matter or any issues relating thereto; provided,
however, that no such settlement shall be entered into without the consent of
the Indemnified Party (with the concurrence of the Conflicts Committee in the
case of the EQM Protected Parties) unless it includes a full release of the
Indemnified Party from such matter or issues, as the case may be, and does not
include any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party with respect to all aspects of the defense of any claims covered by the
indemnification under this _Article VIII_, including, without limitation, the
prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Party of any correspondence or other
notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the
name of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense,
the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any files, records or other
information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party considers
relevant to such defense and the making available to the Indemnifying Party,
at no cost to the Indemnifying Party, of any employees of the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Indemnifying Party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof
on the operations of the Indemnified Party and further agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of all files, records and other information furnished by the
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_. In no event shall the obligation of the
Indemnified Party to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Indemnified
Party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense
of any claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this _Article
VIII_; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its own option,
cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such
defense. The Indemnifying Party agrees to keep any such counsel hired by the
Indemnified Party informed as to the status of any such defense, but the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain sole control over such
defense. In addition, in no event shall an EQM Protected Party be required to
file a claim against any of the EQM Protected Parties in order seek
indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The date on which the Indemnifying Party receives notification of a claim
for indemnification shall determine whether such claim is timely made.

 



 

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY
PARTYS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION HEREUNDER COVER OR INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES OR LOST
PROFITS SUFFERED BY ANY OTHER PARTY ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT RECOVERED IN A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY.

Section 9.9 _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the

(b) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and the remainder
of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a

ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
