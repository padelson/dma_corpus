have each approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Sub to
make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under
this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase any (subject to the Minimum Tender
Condition) and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price per

Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the "WBCL"), whereby each issued and
outstanding Share, other than Dissenting Shares and Shares owned by Parent,
Sub, the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has determined that this Agreement
and the Transactions are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 1.01 The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to Section 7.01, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement), Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The
obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and
pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the
conditions set forth in Annex II (the "Offer Conditions"). The Offer shall
initially expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty
(20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves
the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the
terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent
of the Company (which in the case of clause (viii) below shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that, with
respect to clause (viii) below, the Company may withhold consent if, at any
time prior to any "subsequent offering period," the Top-Up Option is
exercisable in accordance with Section 1.03), Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Sub to, (i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any
Offer Condition in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock,
(v) except as expressly provided in this Section 1.01(a), terminate, extend or
otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to any holder
of Company Common Stock or (viii) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (or such
longer period as the parties may agree) each, if, at any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as each
such condition shall have been satisfied or waived and (ii) extend the Offer
for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; provided,
however, that Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if, 

at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, each Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the
Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, then Sub may and, if
requested by the Company, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the
Offer by increments of five (5) Business Days; provided, that the maximum
number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this sentence shall
be twenty (20) Business Days unless mutually agreed in writing by the Company
and Parent; provided, further, that Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (x)
immediately following any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (if each
Offer Condition shall have been satisfied or, if permitted by this Agreement,
waived at such time) accept for payment all Shares that Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer and (y) following such acceptance, and as
soon as practicable on the Business Day that immediately follows the date on
which the Offer expired, pay for all such Shares. The time at which such
acceptance occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Acceptance Time."
The time at which both (i) sufficient funds for the payment of Shares pursuant
to and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement have been
deposited with the Paying Agent and (ii) the Acceptance Time has occurred is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing." The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a), unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.01 or otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 1.01(a). If (i) at any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, (x) each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum
Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived, (y) the Minimum Tender
Condition shall not have been satisfied and (z) no further extensions or re-
extensions of the Offer are permitted or required pursuant to this Section
1.01(a) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01, then,
in each case, Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Termination," and the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Offer Termination Date." If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.01, Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO"), which shall
include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent
and Sub all information concerning the Company that is required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of
the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, Parent and
Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response. Each of Parent, Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents, as so 

amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any
request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between Parent, Sub and their respective representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Parent
and Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect to the Offer Documents.

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, on a timely basis, all of
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer; provided that in no way shall this Section
1.01(c) in any way reduce, offset or limit the obligations of Parent pursuant
to Section 2.02(a). The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(d) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after the
date of such event, be the Offer Price.

Section 1.02 Company Actions. (a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are
filed with the SEC or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), which shall, subject
to the provisions of Section 5.03, reflect the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, describe and make the Company Recommendation with respect to the
Offer. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares. Parent and Sub
shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule
14D-9. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.
Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
for amendments or 

supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and the Company Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company Board contained in the
Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Sub promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date of execution of this Agreement by all parties)
with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders
of Shares as of the most recent practicable date, together, to the extent
available, with copies of lists of shareholders, security position listings
and computer files in the Company's possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to Sub such information
(including updated lists of record holders and shareholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions,
Parent and Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose such information,
including the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and
files, in each case as required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 1.03 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), to purchase, at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, such
number of Shares (the "Top-Up Option Shares") that, when added to the number
of Shares owned by Parent and Sub and any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share
Number immediately after the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up
Option shall only be exercisable once, in whole and not in part, at or
following the Offer Closing at any time during the five (5) Business Day
period following the Offer Closing (or, if applicable, one or more subsequent
offering periods), but in any event prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms; provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable
unless (A) immediately after the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
issuance of Top-Up Option Shares (and not before), the Short Form Threshold
would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), (B) no
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued or granted any
order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree prohibiting the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise; and (C) the issuance of the Top-Up Option will not cause the Company
to have shares of Company Common Stock outstanding in excess of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned
by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or
committed for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option; provided,
further, that Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, exercise the Top-Up
Option on the same day as the Offer Closing if possible and if that is not
possible as soon thereafter as possible, in each case in 

accordance with this Section 1.03(a). The parties shall cooperate to ensure
that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with
applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. The Top-Up
Option Shares have been duly authorized by the Company Board and, when issued
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

(b) In the event Sub elects to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Sub shall
provide written notice to the Company (the "Top-Up Notice") of the number of
Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer and the Company shall then
promptly notify Parent and Sub of the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be
purchased, such number to be calculated pursuant to Section 1.03(a). Such
notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Sub that, as
promptly as practicable following the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Parent and Sub intend to consummate the Merger in accordance
with the WBCL. The closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares shall
take place at a time and date designated by Parent or Sub (in consultation
with the Company) in the Top-Up Notice, which shall in any event be no later
than five (5) Business Days after the Offer Closing (or, if applicable, one or
more subsequent offering periods), at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One
South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603, unless another time, date or place is
agreed upon by the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed
received by the Company pursuant to Section 8.02 in a manner that results in
Sub becoming a holder of record with respect to the Top-Up Option Shares for
purposes of Section 180.1104 of the WBCL, and if not so consummated on such
day, as promptly thereafter as possible (but in any event no later than five
(5) Business Days after the Offer Closing (or, if applicable, one or more
subsequent offering periods)). At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Parent and Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Sub the Top-Up Option
Shares either in book-entry form or evidence by a certificate (as determined
by the Company). The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option
Shares being purchased by Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price, without interest. Such purchase price shall be paid or cause to be paid
by Sub to the Company, at Parent's election, either (i) entirely in cash, by
wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by (A) paying in cash by wire transfer
of same-day funds an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
the Top-Up Option Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up
Option Shares less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause
(A) (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (1) shall bear simple
interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum in arrears at maturity, (2) shall mature
on the first anniversary of the date of issuance of the Promissory Note, (3)
shall be full recourse to Parent and Sub, (4) may be prepaid, at any time, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and (5) shall have no other
material terms.

(c) Parent and Sub understand that the Top-Up Option Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
Parent and Sub represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option is
being, and the Top-Up Option Shares will be, acquired by Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares shall include any legends
required by the Company and applicable federal securities Laws. 

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 180.1301 of the WBCL as contemplated by Section 2.04 and
none of the parties hereto shall take any position to the contrary in any
appraisal proceeding.

Section 1.04 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the WBCL, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Sub and the Company in accordance with the WBCL. The Merger shall be
effected as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if following
the Acceptance Time and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable,
Parent, Sub and their respective subsidiaries collectively own the minimum
number of Shares necessary for Sub to be merged into the Company pursuant to
Section 180.1104 of the WBCL (the "Short-Form Threshold"), the parties shall
take such necessary and appropriate actions in order to cause the Merger to be
completed (and the Closing to occur) as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter (and, to the extent possible, on the same day as the Offer Closing
or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) in accordance with Section
180.1104 of the WBCL without convening the Company Shareholder Meeting.

Section 1.05 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. (Central prevailing time) on a date to be agreed by Parent
and the Company, but no later than the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions) by
electronic exchange of documents (unless the parties mutually agree to a
physical closing in which case the Closing shall take place as the offices of
Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603) unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.06 Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall
file articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the "Articles of Merger")
with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin in
such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the applicable
provisions of the WBCL. The Merger shall become effective as of the close of
business on the date the Articles of Merger have been received by the
Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin for filing or
at such other date and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in
the Articles of Merger and otherwise in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the WBCL (such date and time, the "Effective Time"). 

Section 1.07 Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

(a) Organizational Documents. At or immediately after the Effective Time (i)
the Company Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii)
the Company Bylaws shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as
the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that references to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to
the name of the Surviving Corporation), in each case until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Directors. Subject to applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the
Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 Conversion of Securities.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock,
including Restricted Stock, (each, a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(ii) and other than
Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), and
all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate representing a Share (a "Certificate") or
non-certificated Share represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") that
formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.01(a)(ii) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter be cancelled and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without interest thereon, subject to Section 2.05.

(ii) Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. All Shares
that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
payment being made with respect thereto. 

(iii) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Offer Price and
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC or another U.S.-based nationally
recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (including, in the capacity of depositary with respect to the Offer,
as applicable, the "Paying Agent") for the holders of Shares to receive the
funds to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and, without limiting the generality of Section 1.01(c) or Section 5.02(b),
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in immediately
available funds, a cash amount equal to the sum of the Aggregate Offer
Consideration plus the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (collectively, the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders of
Shares that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and for
the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be so
deposited, Parent shall assume that no shareholder of the Company shall
perfect any dissenters' right of such shareholder's or its Shares. In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by Section 1.01(a) and this Section 2.02, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying
Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to
the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 1.01(a) and this Section 2.02;
provided that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this Article II, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided, additional
funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in
the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 1.01(a) and this Section 2.02. Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Shares and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in
accordance with Section 1.01(a) and this Section 2.02. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section
1.01(a) and this Section 2.02, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement. 

(b) Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) to the Paying
Agent), and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify, subject to the reasonable consent of the
Company; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance
with Section 2.02(e)) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery
of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) (less any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.05), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be issued to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered and shall be made promptly following the Effective
Time without any action on the part of the person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) or Book-Entry Share.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due 

surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common
Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i); provided, however,
that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary
amount.

Section 2.03 Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Stock and Equity Plans.

(a) Treatment of Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
then outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan
(the "Company Options") shall be fully vested and, at the Effective Time,
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
cancelled Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the "Option Payments"); provided, however,
that (i) any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per
Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (ii) such Option
Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.05. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option
shall be exercisable, and each Company Option shall only entitle the holder
thereof to the payment provided for in this Section 2.03(a).

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of Shares subject to forfeiture restrictions or other
restrictions ("Restricted Stock") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan or
issued pursuant to the exercise of a Company Option shall vest in full and all
restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions) otherwise applicable to such
vested Shares shall lapse, and each such Share of Restricted Stock shall be
treated in accordance with Section 2.01(a).

(c) Termination of Company Stock Plans. As of the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Plans shall terminate, and no further Company Options, Restricted Stock
or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

(d) Parent Funding. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation cash in the amount necessary to
make the Option Payments required under Section 2.03(a), and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments 

required under Section 2.03(a) as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the Payroll
Agent the applicable Option Payments, if any, to the holders of Company
Options, in each case, subject to Section 2.05.

Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares.

(a) It is anticipated that on the record date fixed for purposes of
determining the holders of Shares entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
at, a meeting to approve this Agreement (or for purposes of determining
whether the Merger may be consummated without a shareholder vote under Section
180.1104 of the WBCL), the Shares will continue to be quoted on Nasdaq.
Accordingly, holders of Shares will not have dissenters' rights under Section
180.1302 of the WBCL in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Section 2.04(b) below shall apply in the event that holders of
Shares do have dissenters' rights, whether because the Shares are no longer
quoted on Nasdaq on such record date or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and
outstanding Shares held by a person (a "Dissenting Shareholder") who has not
voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has
complied with all the provisions of the WBCL concerning dissenters' rights of
holders of Shares ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.01(a)(i), but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth the
applicable provisions of the WBCL. If such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws
its demand for dissenters' rights or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its
dissenters' rights, in any case pursuant to the WBCL, its Shares shall be
deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest and subject to
Section 2.05. The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt written notice of any
demands for dissenters' rights with respect to any Shares received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on the
Company pursuant to Section 180.1301 et seq. of the WBCL and (ii) cooperate
with Parent to allow it to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for payment under Section 180.1301 et seq. of the
WBCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

Section 2.05 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including
consideration in respect of the Shares and Company Options vested or cancelled
in the Merger) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions
or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, and are remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

hereof, there are no accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to any
outstanding Shares.

deliver this Agreement and, subject to, in the case of the Merger, the Company

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company Board
and, other than the Company Shareholder Approval and filing the Articles of
Merger with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of

necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Sub) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such

fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws of
general application, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or relating to the

respective properties or assets are bound) or any Company Permit, except, with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), as contemplated by Section 2.03 or for (A)

amendment, acceleration or cancellation or Liens that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse

its businesses as currently conducted (the "Company Permits"), and all such
Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to
have, or the failure to be in full force and effect of, any Company Permits

Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Since January 1, 2013, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries
has been in compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and activities, except for such
noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Company, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending, except for such investigations

the Company has filed with or otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the SEC
all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy

under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, together
with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,

The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company (including, in 

each case, any notes thereto) and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries

(collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") (x) were, except as may be

in the United States on the date of such Company Financial Statement) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by SEC rules and regulations and (y)
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries and the results of their
operations and their cash flows as of the dates and for the periods referred
to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
interim financial statements, for normal year-end adjustments that were not or
will not be material in amount or effect). There are no unconsolidated
Subsidiaries of the Company.



Section 3.07 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or, if applicable, the Proxy Statement (the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and, if applicable, the Proxy Statement,
collectively, the "SEC Transaction Documents") will, at the time such SEC
Transaction Document is filed with the SEC, at any time such SEC Transaction
Document is amended or supplemented or at the time such SEC Transaction
Document is first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are

Statement, insofar as it relates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
other information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the SEC Transaction Documents, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent or Sub or any of their representatives specifically for
inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the SEC Transaction Documents.

Section 3.08 Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls. The Company has
designed and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company has designed
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Section 3.09 Absence of Certain Changes.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, from
December 31, 2014 through the date of this Agreement, (i) the businesses of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been conducted in the ordinary
course of business substantially consistent with past practice and (ii) there
has not been any action, omission, change, event or condition that, if
occurring during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date,
would constitute a breach of clauses (b) or (k) of Section 5.01 hereof.

(b) From December 31, 2014 through the date of this Agreement, there have not
been any changes, circumstances, events or effects that, individually or in
the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.10 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has, or is subject to, any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by
GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, other than liabilities and
obligations (a) disclosed, reserved against or provided for in the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2014 or in the
notes thereto, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since December 31, 2014, (c) incurred or permitted to be

or otherwise disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or (d) that otherwise
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.11 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, claim,
action or proceeding to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to
any outstanding order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator unrelated to this Agreement that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no suit,
claim, action or proceeding to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened seeking to
prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge the Merger or any of the other
Transactions.

Section 3.12 Employee Benefits.

(a) Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and
each other material employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement, in
each case, maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or with respect to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any material obligation or liability, and each employment or
individual consulting agreement entered into by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with any employee or individual consultant thereof (each a "Company
Benefit Plan") other than any employment or individual consulting agreement
for an employee or individual consultant whose annual base salary is less than
$250,000 or any other plan, policy, program or arrangement which is required
to be maintained by applicable Law. With respect to each such Company Benefit
Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and 

correct copy of: (i) each such Company Benefit Plan that has been reduced to
writing and all amendments thereto; (ii) each trust, insurance or
administrative agreement relating to each such Company Benefit Plan; (iii) the
most recent summary plan description, including any summary of material
modifications; (iv) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"); and (v) the most recent determination
letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Benefit
Plan has been administered in compliance with its terms and all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and (ii) there are no claims, actions,
suits, proceedings, investigations, arbitrations, audits or hearings (other
than for routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company
Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status or has timely filed an application for a favorable
determination letter, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype or
volume submitter plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
circumstances as of the date hereof that would be reasonably expected to
result in the revocation of such letter.

(c) Section 3.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company
Benefit Plan that provides health benefits after retirement or other
termination of employment, other than (i) as required by Law, (ii) coverage or
benefits the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former employee
(or any beneficiary of the employee or former employee) or (iii) benefits
provided for a period of not more than eighteen (18) months following
termination of employment or during any period during which the former
employee is receiving severance pay.

(d) At no time during the six-year period prior to the date of this Agreement
has the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates maintained, contributed to or had any obligations or liabilities
under any employee benefit plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, including any multiemployer pension plan (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

(e) Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company
Benefit Plan that may provide for payment (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Merger, to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that is reasonably
expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). There is no written or unwritten agreement,
plan, arrangement or other contract by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are bound to compensate any individual for excise or other Taxes
payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code. 

Section 3.13 Labor.

(a) List of Employees. Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a list of the name or unique identifier of each Company employee as
of the date hereof. The Company has further made available each such
employee's (i) salary or base compensation and annual bonus opportunity and
(ii) title or position, in each case as of the date hereof.

(b) Compliance with Laws. The Company is in compliance with all Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, including but not limited to,
terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work, immigration, equal
employment opportunity, nondiscrimination, benefits, collective bargaining,
the withholding and/or payment of social security and similar taxes, workers'
compensation, leaves of absence and occupational safety and health, except for
such noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any direct or indirect material liability with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor (or comparable
status in the case of a non-U.S. entity or persons) rather than as an
"employee," that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Claims. No action, claim, dispute, grievance, or controversy between the
Company and any present or former employees, independent contractors, or
service providers (or their representatives) that would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. No action against the Company, including
under any worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy (or
comparable policies in the case of non-U.S. persons), that would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

(d) Unions. As of the date hereof, no Company employee is represented by any
labor organization or employee representative body and as of the date hereof,
there is no labor strike or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threat thereof, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary. As of the date
hereof, the Company is not a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with any labor union.

Section 3.14 Tax Matters.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns required
to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof and all such filed Tax
Returns are correct, complete and accurate, and has paid all Taxes due
(whether or not shown on such filed Tax Returns); subject in each case to such
exceptions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Taxes which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has been required by Law to withhold or to
collect for payment on or prior to the date hereof have been duly withheld and
collected and have been paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, subject
to such exceptions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) As of the date hereof there is no action, suit, investigation, audit,
claim or assessment pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
with respect to Taxes for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary may be
liable that, if determined adversely, would, individually or in the aggregate
with all other such actions, suits, investigations, audits, claims or
assessments, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been assessed in
writing against the Company or any Company Subsidiary which (i) individually
or in the aggregate with all other such deficiencies, would constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect if required to be paid by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and (ii) has not been fully paid or adequately reserved in
the Company Financial Statements.

(c) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding written agreements or
waivers extending the statute of limitations applicable to any Tax Return
required to be filed by, or Tax assessment with respect to, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability for Taxes
of another person (other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary) under
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law) as a result of filing Tax Returns on a consolidated, combined, or
unitary basis with such person, as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise, which liability would, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such liabilities, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

(e) The Company and each Company Subsidiary that has participated in a
"reportable transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)
has, to the extent and in the manner required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(d), properly disclosed such participation.

(f) The Company has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable
period described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

(g) As of the date hereof, there are no Liens on any of the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to Taxes, other than Permitted
Liens.

Section 3.15 Properties. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company or a Company Subsidiary has a valid leasehold estate in all real
property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise occupied by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in each case free and clear of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens.

Section 3.16 Environmental Matters. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect:

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance with those
Environmental Laws applicable to their respective operations (including
possessing and complying with any required Environmental Permits), and there
are no administrative or judicial proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company 

Subsidiary and the three years preceding the date of this Agreement none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice, demand,
letter or claim, in either case, alleging that the Company or such Company
Subsidiary is in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental Law.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice of, and there are no, Hazardous Substances present in, at, on, under
any of the real property owned or leased by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, either as a result of the operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or otherwise, that, in either case, would reasonably be expected to
result in a liability under Environmental Laws on the part of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties made in this Section 3.16 are the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement
with respect to Hazardous Substances, Environmental Laws, Environmental
Permits and any other matter related to the environment or the protection of
human health and worker safety.

Section 3.17 Intellectual Property.

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries own or have the right to use in the manner currently used
all Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted (the "Company

except to the extent any such right may be limited by any applicable Contract

such risks as the management of the Company reasonably has determined to be
prudent or as is required by Law or regulation, and all premiums due and
payable thereon have been paid; and (b) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in material breach of or default under any of the insurance
policies, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any
action or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination or
material modification of any of the insurance policies. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company has not received any notice of
termination or cancellation or denial of coverage with respect to any
insurance policy. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all material insurance policies as of the date hereof relating to
the business, assets and operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. 

Section 3.20 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received the
opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to
the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the $16.50 per share of
Company Common Stock in cash to be paid to the holders of Shares pursuant to
this Agreement, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. An

informational purposes after execution of this Agreement, and it is agreed and
understood that such opinion may not be relied on by Parent or Sub.

"moratorium," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law, including,

180.1130 to 180.1134 of the WBCL, Chapter 552 of the Wisconsin Statutes and
Section 6.05 of Chapter DFI of the Wisconsin Administrative Code. The Company
Board has duly adopted resolutions specifying that at and following the
Acceptance Time the provisions of Section 180.1150 of the WBCL will not apply
to any of the outstanding Shares, including any Shares held by Parent,
Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Parent, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. As of the date of
this Agreement, (a) less than 33% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are held of record by residents of the State of Wisconsin and (b) the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are not held of record by 100 or
more persons in the State of Wisconsin.

Section 3.22 Vote Required. If required under applicable Law to approve the
Merger, and provided that the conditions in Section 180.1132(1) of the WBCL
are met, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority
of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon at the Company Shareholder Meeting is the only vote
required (under applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, or
otherwise) of the holders of capital stock of the Company to approve this
Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however, that if the conditions in
Section 180.1132(1) of the WBCL are not met, then in addition to such vote,
the shareholder vote specified in Section 180.1131 of the WBCL is the only
other vote so required (the "Company Shareholder Approval"). 

Section 3.23 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker other than J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 3.24 Anti-Corruption Matters. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has, directly or indirectly, taken any action which would cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to (i) be in violation of the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any other anti-bribery or anti-
corruption related Laws or regulations applicable to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or (ii) violate or operate in noncompliance with any
export restrictions, anti-boycott regulations, embargo regulations or other
similar applicable domestic or foreign Laws, in each case except for such
violation or noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.25 U.S. Government Contracts. Section 3.25 of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth each sales Contract or sales arrangement with a U.S.
governmental agency under which the Company received revenue in 2013 or 2014,

revenues for each 2013 and 2014.

accordance with the terms of any applicable confidentiality agreement, the
return or destruction of any confidential information previously furnished to
any third party with respect to an actual or potential Competing Proposal and
any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be
ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal. Except as permitted by this
Section 5.03, from and after the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not,
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to not, and shall direct the Company
Representatives not to, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiries or the making or submission of any offer, proposal or
indication of interest that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal, (B) furnish any non‑public information
regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person in
connection with, or under circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal, (C) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any third person with respect to any Competing Proposal, (D)
amend, terminate or waive any provisions of any confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement to which it is a party with respect to any actual or
potential Competing Proposal, (E) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or acquisition agreement relating to any Competing
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) 

or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions (an "Acquisition Agreement") or (F) agree or publicly announce an
intention to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement if,
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company or any of the Company
Representatives has received a bona fide written Competing Proposal (it being
agreed that the Company Board may correspond in writing with any person making
such a written Competing Proposal to request clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Competing Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal)
from a person that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.03,
and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing Proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such
Competing Proposal; provided, however, that the Company (x) will not, will not
permit the Company Subsidiaries to, and will not authorize the Company
Representatives to, disclose any non-public information regarding the Company
to such person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such person; (y) will promptly (and in any event within 48
hours thereafter) provide Parent with the identity of the third party making
such Competing Proposal and a copy thereof (including drafts of any
documentation and financing commitments submitted to the Company by such third
party at the time it makes such Competing Proposal) or, if not made in
writing, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Competing Proposal and (z) will as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 24 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any material information
concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available
to such other person (or its representatives) that was not previously provided
or made available to Parent. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Competing Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours). In
addition, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company or, to the knowledge
of the Company, any of the Company Representatives receives any indication of
interest, inquiry or request for discussions or information from any third
party with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Proposal, including the identity of such third party and the nature
of such indication, inquiry or request and shall keep Parent informed on a
prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of any material developments
or discussions with respect thereto. The Company agrees that it shall not
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date hereof that would prohibit the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with this Section 5.03.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(d) or Section 5.03(e), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt, authorize, approve,
recommend or submit to a vote of its stockholders any Competing Proposal, (ii)
fail to include in the Schedule 14D-9, or withdraw, withhold, modify or amend,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (iii) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt of a written request by Parent following a Competing Proposal becoming
publicly known (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii), a "Change of Company Recommendation"). 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a Change of
Company Recommendation in connection with a concurrent termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) if:

(i) (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of
Section 5.03) is made to the Company by a third person and such Competing
Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company's
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a "Notice of Change of
Recommendation"), which notice shall include the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, including copies of the definitive agreements and
financing commitments relating to the Superior Proposal in the form to be
entered into, and identify the person or group making such Superior Proposal
(it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of
Recommendation by the Company nor the public announcement that the Company
Board is considering making a Change of Company Recommendation under
applicable Law shall, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation);

(iii) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five
(5) Matching Period Business Days following receipt by Parent of such Notice
of Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation and an additional period of three (3) Matching Period
Business Days from the date of such notice); and

(iv) following the negotiation period contemplated by the foregoing clause
(iii), taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a Change of
Company Recommendation in response to a material event, change or development
(other than in connection with a Competing Proposal) the existence, magnitude
or consequences of which were not known by the Company Board at or prior to
the date hereof and which did not result from or arise out of the announcement
or pendency of, or actions or omissions pursuant to, this Agreement (such
event, change or development, an "Intervening Event"), if:

(i) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company's
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation, which notice shall
describe the circumstances relating to such Intervening Event (it being agreed
that neither the delivery of the such notice by the Company nor the public
announcement that the Company Board is 

considering making a Change of Company Recommendation under applicable Law
shall, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

(ii) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five
(5) days following receipt by Parent of such notice; and

(iii) following the negotiation period contemplated by the foregoing clause
(ii), taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to a Change of Company Recommendation in light of
such Intervening Event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that
the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change
of Company Recommendation).

(g) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not take any
action for the purpose of exempting any person other than Parent and Sub from
the application of any Takeover Statutes. 

Section 5.04 Proxy Statement; Shareholder Meeting.

(a) If, after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, approval of the shareholders of the
Company is required under applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Company
shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Acceptance Time. In connection therewith, the Company shall prepare and file a
preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Subject to Section 5.03, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish
all information concerning it and Sub that is necessary or appropriate in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect thereto, to the extent reasonably practicable, the
Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and shall consider in good faith any comments on such
document or response reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments to the Proxy Statement from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent or Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as
promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such notification,
the Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information as promptly as practicable after Parent has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's shareholders in
accordance with Section 5.04(a), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting").
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the Company
Shareholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders
of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Shareholder Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholder
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has
not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval at the 

Company Shareholder Meeting or (iii) to the extent required by applicable Law.
Subject to Section 5.03, the Company Board shall recommend that the Company's
shareholders approve this Agreement, and the Company shall, unless there has
been a Change of Company Recommendation or this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with its terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and to
take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company
Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board
makes a Change of Company Recommendation, the Company shall not be obligated
to take any action otherwise required pursuant to Section 5.03 or this Section
5.04, and the Company may cancel any scheduled Company Shareholder Meeting.

(d) At the Company Shareholder Meeting, Parent, Sub and their respective
affiliates shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
them in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be
required to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting if this Agreement is
terminated before the Acceptance Time or the Merger is able to be consummated
pursuant to Section 180.1104 of the WBCL.

Section 5.05 Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to:
(a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere with
the operation of any business conducted by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (b) furnish
promptly such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts,
assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or
its representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes in good faith that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party; (iii) result
in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving information
that is competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any
applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law); provided,
further, that if the Company does not disclose information in reliance on the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), it shall provide notice to Parent that it
is withholding such information and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not give rise to the basis for such nondisclosure. During any
visit to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws
and all of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' safety and security
procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.05, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent,
Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any environmental investigation at any real
property owned or leased by the Company, and in no event may any environmental
investigation 

include any sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water,
groundwater, soil or anything else at or in connection with any of such real
property. Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective representatives, to hold all information provided or
furnished pursuant to this Section 5.05 confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.06 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

(a) Subject to Section 5.03, each of Parent and the Company shall (and Parent
shall cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Transactions and to cause the conditions set forth in Article
VI and Annex II to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall (and Parent shall cause each
of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain
all actions or nonactions, consents, Permits (including Environmental
Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental
Entities or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the date hereof, make and not withdraw (without the
Company's consent) all registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity
or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, including the filings required of them or their "ultimate parent
entities" under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and promptly make any
further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable, (iii)
defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which
it or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement
or the consummation of the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a
final, non-appealable order with respect to each such lawsuit or other
proceeding, (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to
consummate the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-
appealable order with respect thereto, (v) seek to resolve any objection or
assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the
Transactions and (vi) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions.

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in Section 5.06(a), Parent
shall promptly take (and shall cause each of its affiliates to take) any and
all actions necessary or advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment and obtain all approvals and consents under any Antitrust
Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local
Governmental Entity, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable
the parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable,
including accepting operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing
to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise,
the sale, license, disposition or holding separate of, such assets or
businesses of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders of the relevant
Governmental Entity) as may be required to obtain such approvals or consents
of such Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or
orders that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that Parent
shall not be required to take any such action to the extent that such action
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly or
indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take any
action, 

including acquiring or making any investment in any person or any division or
assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in
the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VI or Annex II or the
consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
5.06, each party hereto shall, subject to requirements of any Governmental
Entity and any applicable Law, and subject to all applicable privileges,
including the attorney-client privilege (provided, that if Parent does not
disclose information in reliance on the foregoing, it shall provide notice to
the Company that it is withholding such information and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not give rise to the basis for such
nondisclosure): (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding.

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall give the notices set forth in Section 5.06(d)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and, to the extent required thereby, both the Company and
Parent shall take the actions described in Section 5.06(d)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Company shall have no
obligation to take any other action with respect to any of the Contracts
referred to in such Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) the
Company shall not be deemed to have breached any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement in the event that any addressee of any of
the notices set forth in Section 5.06(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
responds to any such notice in any manner and (iii) no such response, or
failure to respond to any of such notices, shall be deemed to have any effect
on any of the Offer Conditions.

Section 5.07 Public Announcements. The initial press release issued by Parent
and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a
joint press release, and thereafter, except with respect to any public
statement by the Company with respect to any Change of Company Recommendation,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange. 

Section 5.08 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Indemnification. For a period of not less than six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including in his or her capacity
as fiduciary under any benefit plan of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) (each an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or,
subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in
settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or served as a fiduciary under any benefit plan of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or
pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such
person's rights under this Section 5.08. In the event of any such loss,
expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified
Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred
(provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b) Insurance. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time,
and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage to the Indemnified Parties for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the
intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy; provided, that the Company shall consult
with Parent regarding the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and,
provided, further, that the annual premium for such policies does not exceed
in any one year three hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate
premium(s) under the Company's existing policies. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason have failed to obtain such "tail"
insurance policy, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company's
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance during such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any
claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof 

(c) Successors. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.08.

(d) Continuation. For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar documents) of
each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents
of any Company Subsidiary, insofar as such provisions relate to the
Indemnified Parties. The contractual indemnification rights, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(e) Benefit. The provisions of this Section 5.08 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without
the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby.

(f) Non-Exclusivity. The provisions of this Section 5.08 are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this Section 5.08, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.09 Takeover Statutes. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that, to the greatest extent practicable,
no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the
Merger or the other Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent practicable)
the effects of such Takeover Statute on such transactions. 

Section 5.10 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Benefit Protection Period"), Parent
shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to provide (i) base salary, wages and commission opportunities to each
individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee") that are
no less favorable than the base salary, wages or commission opportunities
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) an annual bonus opportunity (which for this purpose shall mean the bonus
that would be payable upon attainment of target performance) to each Company
Employee that is not less than the annual bonus opportunity provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance
benefits to each Company Employee that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided under any Company Benefit Plan that is a severance
plan, policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) other compensation and
benefits (including paid-time off but excluding equity compensation) to each
Company Employee that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
other compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), except as consented to
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Company Employee, as
appropriate, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and
continue all of the Company Benefit Plans that are severance, retention or
termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including
any change in control or severance agreement between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event) and, for
the duration of the Benefit Protection Period, or such longer period of time
as required under the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program or
arrangement, shall do so without any amendment or modification, other than any
amendment or modification required to comply with applicable Law or as
consented to by the parties thereto.

(c) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
and vesting (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plans) under
any "employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
but without regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any
other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
including any vacation, paid time off and severance plans, each Company
Employee's service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which the Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work 

requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, other than limitations,
exclusions, work requirements or waiting periods that are already in effect
with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the
Closing Date under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible, co-payment or similar limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plan, policy or arrangement, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any
other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee
thereof or any other third person any right to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee.

Section 5.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article II. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with
the Transactions shall be paid when due by Parent, Sub or, after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.12 Rule 16b-3 Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to take such actions as may
be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or
director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
pursuant to the Transactions are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
will, to the extent not previously taken, take all such actions and steps as
may be required (a) to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated
under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or employee
benefit arrangements, including the Company Benefit Plans, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) entered into on or after the date of this Agreement by
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any affiliate of Parent with
current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries, in each case under which any such person could become entitled
to (i) any additional compensation, enhanced severance or other benefits or
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation,
severance or other benefits or any funding of any compensation or benefits by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as a result of the Offer or
(ii) any other compensation or benefits from the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries related to or contingent upon or the value of which would be
calculated on the 

basis of the Offer, and (b) to ensure that any such arrangements fall within
the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

Section 5.14 Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, (a) the
Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any stockholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
stockholder litigation, (b) the Company shall consult with Parent regarding
the defense, settlement or prosecution of any such stockholder litigation, and
(c) the Company shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to any such stockholder litigation in an amount in
excess of the amount set forth on Section 5.01(q) of the Company Disclosure
Letter without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.15 Certain Indebtedness. Immediately prior to entering into this
Agreement, the Company executed and delivered a promissory note to FUJIFILM
Holdings America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Lender"), evidencing
the Loan (as defined below). As soon as possible after banks open for business
in New York City, and in any event no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date hereof, Parent shall cause Lender to lend to the Company, by
initiating a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account
specified by the Company in writing to Parent prior to the date hereof, the
amount (the "Loan") required to pay off all amounts owing under that certain
Credit Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2013, by and among the Company and the
various other parties thereto (the "Existing Credit Agreement"). The Company
shall use the proceeds of the Loan to pay off such amounts owing under the
Existing Credit Agreement as soon as possible following receipt of such
proceeds.

Section 180.1104 of the WBCL, this Agreement will have been duly adopted by

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the date hereof
(the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that if all of the Offer Conditions,
other than the condition set forth in clause (b) of Annex II, shall have been

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued, enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced any
Law permanently enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the Offer or the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and such Law shall have become final
and non-appealable, if applicable; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.01(d) shall not be available to any party that
has failed to use its reasonable best efforts to contest, resolve or lift, as
applicable, such Law; provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.01(d) shall not be available to any party (i)

(g) by the Company if the Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified or
amended the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.03(e);

(h) by Parent, if: (i)(A) there is an inaccuracy in the Company's
representations contained in this Agreement or (B) the Company has failed to
perform its covenants contained in this Agreement, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in clause (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of Annex II would not
be satisfied; (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company written notice
of such inaccuracy or failure to perform; and (iii) either such inaccuracy or
failure to perform is not capable of cure prior to the Outside Date or at
least thirty (30) days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such
written notice to the Company and such inaccuracy or failure to perform shall
not have been cured; provided, however, that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(h) if the inaccuracy of
the representations of Parent or Sub contained in 

this Agreement or Parent's or Sub's failure to perform its covenants contained
in this Agreement has prevented or would reasonably be expected to prevent
Parent or Sub from consummating the Transactions;

(i) by the Company, if (i)(A) there is an inaccuracy in Parent's or Sub's
representations contained in this Agreement or (B) Parent or Sub fails to
perform its covenants contained in this Agreement, in either case that has
prevented or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Sub from
consummating the Transactions; (ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
written notice of such inaccuracy or failure to perform; and (iii) either such
inaccuracy or failure to perform is not capable of cure prior to the Outside
Date or at least thirty (30) days shall have elapsed since the date of
delivery of such written notice to Parent and such inaccuracy or failure to
perform shall not have been cured; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(i)
if the inaccuracy of the representations of the Company contained in this
Agreement or the Company's failure to perform its covenants contained in this
Agreement is such that a condition contained in clause (c)(ii) or (iii) of
Annex II would not be satisfied; or

(j) by the Company, if (i) all the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied
or waived as of the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the Offer Closing does
not occur within three (3) Business Days in accordance with Section 1.01(a).

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors, in either
case, except (i) with respect to the penultimate sentence of Section 1.02(b),
the last sentence of Section 5.05, Section 5.11, this Section 7.02 and Article
VIII and (ii) with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered
by a party as a result of another party's fraud or the knowing and intentional
material breach by another party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or (B) the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(f) or Section 7.01(g), then the Company shall pay to Parent or
its designee, within two (2) Business Days following the date of such
termination by Parent pursuant to clause (A), or prior to or concurrently with
such termination by the Company pursuant to clause (B), the Company
Termination Fee; or

(ii) (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Sections 7.01(b), 7.01(c)
or 7.01(h) (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer
Termination a Competing Proposal shall have been made to the Company and not
withdrawn and (C) within twelve (12) months after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall have consummated a Competing Proposal or entered
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal (in each
case, which Competing Proposal may be the same as or different from the
Competing Proposal referred to in the immediately preceding clause (B)), then
the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee
within 

two (2) Business Days after the earliest to occur of such consummation or
entry into an Acquisition Agreement; provided that for purposes of this
Section 7.02(b)(ii), the term "Competing Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term, except that all percentages therein shall be changed to
"50%".

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 7.02 are an integral part of the Transactions and
(ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay to
Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.02(b). In
the event that Parent receives full payment of the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 7.02(b), except for fraud or the knowing and intentional
material breach of this Agreement by the Company, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of their
respective affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

Section 7.03 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent
and Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after the Acceptance Time, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by the Company's shareholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto.

Section 7.04 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the
other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein; provided, however, that after the Acceptance Time, there may
not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger
Consideration or that adversely affects the rights of the Company's
shareholders hereunder without the approval of the Company's shareholders at a
duly convened meeting of the Company's shareholders called to obtain approval
of such extension or waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Section 8.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 8.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

Section 8.05 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any
assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.

Section 8.06 Parties in Interest. Except for (a) Article II, which shall be
for the benefit of any person entitled to payment thereunder and (b) Section
5.08, which shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, each of
whom shall be an express third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, Parent,
Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein; provided, that the rights of such third-party beneficiaries shall not
arise unless and until the Acceptance Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with Section 7.04 without notice or liability to any
other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.07 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of 

proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders;
(c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and
(d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in
this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and words of similar
meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as otherwise
indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and
"Exhibits," are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and the
Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to
"$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term "or" shall not be deemed
to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References herein
to "as of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" or words of
similar import shall be deemed to mean "as of immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement." The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 8.08 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Wisconsin, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the United States
Federal District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin (and to the
extent such court does not have jurisdiction, the state courts of the State of
Wisconsin located in the county of Dane, Wisconsin), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties agrees
not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court described above. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as
provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process, and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts described above for any reason, (ii) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED 

AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE
FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.08(C).

Section 8.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 8.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened
to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that, (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to
this Section 8.10 shall not in any way constitute a waiver by any party
seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to it under this Agreement, including under Section 7.02, in the
event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.10 are not available or otherwise are
not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require a party to
institute any proceeding for (or limit a party's right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.10 prior, or as a
condition, to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal
proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this Section 8.10 or anything set
forth in this Section 8.10 restrict or limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter and
(iii) no party shall require the other to post any bond or other security as a
condition to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this
Section 8.10.

Annex I

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that
contains provisions, including a standstill covenant, that are no less
favorable in the good faith judgment of the Company to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

"Adjusted Outstanding Share Number" shall be, as of any time of determination,
the sum of (a) the aggregate number of Shares outstanding at such time plus
(b) an additional number of Shares equal to the aggregate number of Shares
issuable upon the vesting (including vesting solely as a result of any of the
Transactions), conversion, exchange or exercise, as applicable, of any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares that are
outstanding as of such time (but prior to the Offer Closing excluding any
Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option).

"affiliate" means, with respect to any person, any other person that directly

the Specified Date, (ii) the number of Shares which, together with the number

Governmental Entity (other than in connection with a Specified Foreign Law)
that seeks, directly or indirectly, to challenge, prohibit, enjoin or
otherwise prevent the Offer or the Merger; provided, further, that the
condition in this clause shall not be available to Parent or Sub (i) if the

representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement,
without regard to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers

Offer as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent expressly
made as of a specific date, in which case as of such specific date);

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it;

(iv) since the date of the Agreement, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(v) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by an executive officer of the Company as to the satisfaction of the
conditions in clauses (c)(ii), (c)(iii) and (c)(iv) of this Annex II; or

sole benefit of Parent and Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other

to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
