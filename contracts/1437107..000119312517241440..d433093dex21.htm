ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES; EXCHANGE

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

(i) _Merger Consideration_. Each common voting share, $0.01 par value per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Voting Shares_ ") and each Class A
Common Share, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the " _Class A
Shares_ " and, collectively with the Common Voting Shares, the " _Shares_ "
and each a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (A) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub and (B)
Shares that are owned by shareholders (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ ")
who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 1701.84 of the OGCL (each such Share referred to in clauses (A) and
(B) above, an " _Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "))
shall be converted into the right to receive the following consideration (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "):

 



3 (A) Each Share with respect to which an election to receive a combination of
stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been properly made and not
revoked pursuant to Section 4.3 (each, a " _Mixed Consideration Electing
Share_ ") and each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (1) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Series C Common Stock (the " _Mixed Election Stock Consideration_ ") equal
to the product of (w) the applicable Base Exchange Ratio and (x) 0.30 and (2)
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum (the " _Mixed Election
Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Mixed Election Stock
Consideration, the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ ") of (y) $63.00 plus (z)
the Cash Top-Up Amount, if any;

(B) Each Share with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "
_Cash Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section
4.3 (each, a " _Cash Electing Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest (the " _Cash
Election Consideration_ "), equal to the dollar value of the Mixed Election
Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be calculated with the
Mixed Election Stock Consideration being valued based on the Average Parent
Stock Price), except that if the product of the number of Cash Electing
Shares and the Cash Election Consideration (such product, the " _Aggregate
Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then each
Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (w) the Cash
Election Consideration and (x) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the
Aggregate Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and
(2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series
C Common Stock equal to the product of (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be an amount equal to the dollar value of the Mixed Election
Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be calculated with the
Mixed Election Stock Consideration being valued based on the Average Parent
Stock Price) and the denominator of which shall be the Average Parent Stock
Price and (z) one minus the Cash Fraction; and

 

(C) Each Share with respect to which an election to receive stock
consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked
pursuant to Section 4.3 (each, a " _Stock Electing Share_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Series C Common Stock (the " _Stock Election
Consideration_ ") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) an amount
equal to the dollar value of the Mixed Election Consideration (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be calculated with the Mixed Election
Stock Consideration being valued based on the Average Parent Stock Price) by
(2) the Average Parent Stock Price; _provided_ that if the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Aggregate Cash Election Amount, then each Stock
Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive (3) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (w) the amount by which the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Aggregate Cash Election Amount, divided by (x) the
number of Stock Electing Shares and (4) a number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Series C Common Stock equal to the product of
(y) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) an amount equal to the dollar value
of the Mixed Election Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
be calculated with the Mixed Election Stock Consideration being valued based
on the Average Parent Stock Price) by (II) the Average Parent Stock Price and
(z) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election
Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (3) of this paragraph and
the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Consideration.

 



4 (ii) At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and (A) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-entry account
formerly representing any uncertificated Shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ")
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions or dividends payable
pursuant to Section 4.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Series C Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e), without interest, in
each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 4.2, in the case of certificated
Shares, and automatically in the case of Uncertificated Shares, and each
Certificate and Uncertificated Share formerly representing Shares owned by
Dissenting Shareholders shall thereafter represent only the rights granted to
Dissenting Shareholders by the OGCL.

(iii) _Maximum Merger Consideration_. For the avoidance of doubt:

 

(A) Subject to Section 4.5, the Mixed Election Cash Consideration shall not
exceed (1) in the event that Parent shall not have made the Cash Top-Up
Election, $63.00 or (2) in the event that Parent shall have made the Cash Top-
Up Election, $66.38; and

(B) The aggregate amount of cash paid (not including cash paid pursuant to
Section 4.2(e)), and the aggregate number of shares of Series C Common Stock
issued, to all of the holders of Shares pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) shall
not exceed the aggregate amount of cash that would have been paid, and the
aggregate number of shares of Series C Common Stock that would have been
issued, to all of the holders of Shares had the Mixed Election been made with
respect to each Share.

 

(iv) Certain Definitions with Respect to the Merger Consideration.

 

(A) The term " _Available Cash Election Amount_ " means the difference between
(1) the product of the Mixed Election Cash Consideration and the total number
of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares) minus (2) the product of the number of Mixed
Consideration Electing Shares (including any Non-Electing Shares) and the
Mixed Election Cash Consideration.

(B) The term " _Base Exchange Ratio_ " means the following (in each
case rounded to four decimal places):



     | I. | if the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than $28.70,
then the Base Exchange Ratio shall be 3.1360; 
---|---|--- 



     | II. | if the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal
to $22.32 but less than or equal to $28.70, then the Base Exchange Ratio shall
equal the quotient obtained by dividing (y) $90.00 by (z) the Average Parent
Stock Price; or 
---|---|--- 
 



5 then the Base Exchange Ratio shall be 4.0320. 
---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Base Exchange Ratio would be greater
than 3.5280 but for this paragraph, then Parent shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to reduce the Base Exchange Ratio to no less than 3.5280
(such election, the " _Cash Top-Up Election_ " and, the amount by which Parent
has decided to reduce the Base Exchange Ratio (rounded to four decimal
places), the " _Base Exchange Ratio Reduction_ ") and, in such case, the Base
Exchange Ratio shall be the amount determined by Parent pursuant to this
paragraph. Parent shall make a public announcement of its determination
to make a Cash Top-Up Election, and the Base Exchange Ratio Reduction, to the
extent applicable, at least two (2) Trading Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

The term " _Cash Top-Up Amount_ " means:



     | I. | in the event that Parent shall have made the Cash Top-Up
Election, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
Base Exchange Ratio Reduction, (y) 0.30 and (z) the Average Parent Stock
Price (such product, for the avoidance of doubt, not to exceed $3.38); 
---|---|--- 



     | II. | in the event that Parent shall not have made the Cash Top-Up
Election, zero. 
---|---|--- 

(C) The term " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means the volume weighted
average price of Series C Common Stock on NASDAQ Global Select Market ("
_NASDAQ_ ") (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by the parties) measured on a
cumulative basis over the fifteen (15) consecutive Trading Days ending on (and
including) the Trading Day that is three (3) Trading Days prior to the date of
the Effective Time.

(D) The term " _Trading Day_ " means a day on which shares of Series C Common
Stock are traded on the NASDAQ.

(v) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Subject to Section 4.4, each Excluded
Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist.

 

(b) _Merger Sub_. Each common share, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Company,
and such converted shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Company.

 



6 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys
prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
(i) an aggregate number of shares of Series C Common Stock to be issued in
uncertificated form or book-entry form and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash,
in each case, comprising approximately the amounts required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in respect of Shares. In addition, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) with respect to the Series C Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Merger with respect to Shares with a record and
payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such
Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
4.2(e). All shares of Series C Common Stock and cash, together with the
amount of any dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 4.2(a), shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) such investments
shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. (" _Moody s_") or Standard and Poors Corporation (" _S andP_"),
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no such investment (or
losses thereon) shall affect the amount of the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section
4.1(a). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect
the applicable terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than Excluded
Shares or any holder of a Certificate who properly made and did not revoke a
Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election pursuant to Section 4.3)
a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)). Each holder of a Certificate
who properly made and did not revoke a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a
Stock Election pursuant to Section 4.3 shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Mixed Election Consideration, the Cash Election
Consideration or the Stock Election Consideration, as applicable, for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate, 

 



7  any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Series C Common Stock payable
pursuant to Section 4.2(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Each holder of a Certificate representing Non-Electing
Shares, upon the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the terms of such transmittal materials, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Mixed Election Consideration for each Non-Electing Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Series C Common Stock payable pursuant to 4.2(e), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Series C
Common Stock in uncertificated form, together with a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. If any shares (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) of Series C Common Stock are to be issued to a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay any stock transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the issuance of shares (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
of Series C Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
or the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Series C
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Series C Common Stock,
the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Series C
Common Stock issuable in the Merger. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Series C Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)), there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the whole shares of Series C Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest thereon, (A) at the time
of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares
of Series C Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Series C Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time,
but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



8 (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Series C Common Stock will be issued and
any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Series C Common
Stock but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment
in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent
(after aggregating all fractional Shares otherwise due to such holder) and
shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Series C
Common Stock based on the Average Parent Stock Price.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for one-hundred and eighty (180)
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to
Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not
theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent
for delivery of any shares of Series C Common Stock and payment of cash and
any dividends and other distributions in respect of the Series C Common Stock
to be issued or paid pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h))
upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
such Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Exchange
Agent or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the cash, shares of Series C Common Stock and any dividends and other
distributions in respect of the Series C Common Stock that would have been
issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h))
had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent,

 



9  Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Uncertificated Shares_. Any holder of Uncertificated Shares that are Non-
Electing Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Mixed Election
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 4.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Series C
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e) that such holder is entitled
to receive. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more
Uncertificated Shares (other than any holder of an Uncertificated Share who
properly made and did not revoke a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock
Election pursuant Section 4.3) shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent
to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Mixed
Election Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 4.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Series C
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e) for each Uncertificated Share.

4.3 _Election Procedure_.

 

(a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date, is a registered holder
of Shares, other than Excluded Shares, shall be entitled to specify the
number of such holders Shares with respect to which such holder makes a Mixed
Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election by complying with the procedures
set forth in this Section 4.3.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Form S-4 a form of
election (the " _Form of Election_ ") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Form of Election and such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such
other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree)
and the Company shall mail to each registered holder of Shares as of the
record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting the Form of Election with the
Companys proxy statement. The Form of Election shall be used by each
registered holder of Shares (or, in the case of nominee holders, the
beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) to make a
Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election. In the event that a
holder fails to make a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election
with respect to any Shares held or beneficially owned by such holder, then
such holder shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to
those Shares (each such Share, a " _Non-Electing Share_ "). The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available
to all persons who become registered holders of Shares during the period
between the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Election
Date.

 



10 (c) Any holders election will be deemed properly made only if the Exchange
Agent has received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on (i) the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (ii) if the
Closing Date is more than four (4) Business Days after the date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, the date that is two (2) Business Days preceding the
Closing Date (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of Election duly completed and
validly executed and accompanied by (A) Certificates representing the Shares
to which such Form of Election relates (or customary affidavits and, if
required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election, the posting by
such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Form of Election may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate) or (B) in the case of Uncertificated
Shares, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the
Form of Election. Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the
anticipated Election Date at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date,
the Election Date shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent
and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined,
the rescheduled Election Date.

(d) After a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly
made with respect to any Shares, no further registration of transfers of such
shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and
until such Mixed Election, Cash Election or Stock Election is properly
revoked in accordance with this Section 4.3. Any Mixed Election, Cash Election
or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the
Shares subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the Election Date. In addition, all Mixed Elections,
Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII. If a Mixed
Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election is revoked, the Shares to which
such election previously applied shall be treated as Non-Electing Shares
unless and until a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election in
respect of such Shares is subsequently submitted to the Exchange Agent on or
prior to the Election Date in accordance with this Section 4.3. Certificates
will not be returned to holders unless the holder so requests.

(e) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of
Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make
any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not a
Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been properly made or
revoked pursuant to this Section 4.3 and as to when Mixed Elections, Cash
Elections and Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange
Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent and the Company jointly, in the event
that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation)
shall also make all computations contemplated by Section 4.1, and absent
manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange
Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent and the Company, make any
rules as are consistent with this Section 4.3 for the implementation of Mixed
Elections, Cash Elections and Stock Elections as shall be necessary or
desirable to effect such elections in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

4.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive shares of Series C Common Stock or cash or any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV unless and until
the holder thereof shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise) from the
Merger under the OGCL, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
only such rights as are provided by Section 1701.84 of the OGCL with respect
to Shares owned by such Dissenting

 



11  Shareholder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting
Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) under Section 1701.84 of the OGCL
or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall finally determine that the
Dissenting Shareholder is not entitled to relief provided by Section 1701.84
of the OGCL with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be
treated as though such Shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time,
into the right to receive the Mixed Election Consideration without interest
and less any required Tax withholding. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law received by the Company relating to shareholders rights of
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

4.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of
Series C Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for any such Series C Common Stock, in each case issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such
event on the Merger Consideration.

 

4.6 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, with respect to each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, (x) if the exercise price of
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Cash Election
Consideration, such Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being
payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect, and (y) if
the exercise price of such Company Option is less than the Cash Election
Consideration, thirty percent (30%) of such Company Options held by each
holder thereof (rounded to the nearest whole share), other than any Company
Option that is not held by a Company Employee and any Company Option held by a
non-employee Director, shall be deemed to be " _Rollover Options_ " and the
remaining Company Options (other than Company Options cancelled pursuant to
clause (x) above) shall be deemed to be " _Cash-Out Options_ ". At the
Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof:

(i) each such Cash-Out Option shall terminate and be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive,
in accordance with this Section 4.6(a), a lump sum cash payment in the amount
equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the
dollar value of the Cash Election Consideration (the " _Cash Award
Consideration_ "), over the applicable exercise price (the " _Option Payment_
"). The Option Payment (if any) payable under this Section 4.6(a) to each
former holder of a Company Option that was outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be paid through the Surviving Companys payroll
to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time
(but in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), net of
any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 4.2(h); and

 



12 (ii) each Rollover Option shall be assumed and converted automatically into a
fully-vested option (an " _Adjusted Stock Option_ ") to purchase, on
substantially the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were
applicable under such Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the number of shares of Series C Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option
shall have an exercise price per share of Series C Common Stock equal to the
quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the
exercise price per Share subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio. The " _Option Exchange
Ratio_ " shall equal the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by
dividing (i) the weighted average price of the Class A Shares on the NASDAQ
on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of the Effective Time by (ii)
the Average Parent Stock Price.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, thirty
percent (30%) of each outstanding award of restricted stock units that is
subject solely to time-based vesting (a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ ")
that was granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or payable
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested
(other than the Company Restricted Stock Units listed on Section 4.6(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, which, together with the Company Performance Stock
Units listed on Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute
all Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Stock Units that do
not, by their terms, vest upon a change of control (the " _Continuing Awards_
")), shall be deemed to be " _Converted Units_ " and the remaining seventy
percent (70%) of each award of Company Restricted Stock Units (excluding
Continuing Awards) shall be deemed to be "Cash-Out Units". At the Effective
Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof:

(i) each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is a Cash-Out Unit shall terminate
and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange
for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) the number of
Shares subject to such Cash-Out Unit, multiplied by (ii) Cash Award
Consideration; and

 

(ii) each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is a Converted Unit (other than
Continuing Awards) shall be assumed and converted automatically into a fully
vested restricted stock unit relating to shares of Series C Common Stock (an "
_Adjusted Unit Award_ ") entitling the holder to receive, on substantially the
same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were applicable under such
Converted Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after giving
effective to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the consummation of
the Merger), a number of shares of Series C Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Series C Common Stock) equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Converted Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Stock Award
Consideration, with any fractional shares being rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Series C Common Stock. The " _Stock Award Consideration_ "
shall equal the Stock Election Consideration determined without giving effect
to the proviso in Section 4.1(a)(i)(C).

 



13 (iii) Following the Effective Time, no such Company Restricted Stock Unit that
was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the consideration set forth in this Section 4.6(b) in exchange for
such Company Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this Section 4.6(b) (or,
with respect to Continuing Awards, as set forth in Section 4.6(d)). The
consideration payable under this Section 4.6(b) to each former holder of a
Company Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be paid through the Surviving Companys payroll to, or,
with respect to Converted Units, through the grant of an Adjusted Unit
Award and settlement through the issuance of shares of Series C Common Stock
in the name of, such former holder as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 4.2(h); _provided_
, _however_ , that that to the extent any such payment would cause an
impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code (" _Section
409A_ "), such amounts shall become vested at the Effective Time and will be
paid at the earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible
acceleration event under Section 409A.

 

(c) _Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time,
thirty percent (30%) of each outstanding award of restricted stock units that
is subject to performance-based vesting (a " _Company Performance Stock Unit_
") that was granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding or
payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested (other than any that are Continuing Awards, shall be deemed to be
Converted Units and the remaining 70% percent of each award of Company
Performance Stock Units (excluding any that are Continuing Awards) shall be
deemed to be Cash-Out Units. At the Effective Time, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof:

(i) each Company Performance Stock Unit that is a Cash-Out Unit shall
terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Cash-Out Unit that would vest assuming
target levels of achievement were met, multiplied by (y) the Cash Award
Consideration; and

 

(ii) each Company Performance Stock Unit that is a Converted Unit (other than
Continuing Awards) shall be assumed and converted automatically into a fully
vested Adjusted Unit Award entitling the holder to receive, on substantially
the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were applicable under
such Converted Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (and after
giving effective to any acceleration of vesting resulting from the
consummation of the Merger), a number of shares of Series C Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Series C Common Stock)
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Performance Stock Unit that would vest assuming target levels of achievement
were met, multiplied by (y) the Stock Award Consideration, with any fractional
shares being rounded down to the nearest whole share of Series C Common
Stock.

 



14 (iii) Following the Effective Time, no such Company Performance Stock Unit
that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Performance Stock Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the consideration set forth in this Section 4.6(c) in exchange for
such Company Performance Stock Unit in accordance with this Section 4.6(c)
(or, with respect to Continuing Awards, as set forth in Section 4.6(d)). The
consideration payable under this Section 4.6(c) to each former holder of a
Company Performance Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Continuing Awards) shall be paid, with respect to
Cash-Out Units, through the Surviving Companys payroll to, or, with respect
to Converted Units, through the grant of an Adjusted Unit Award and settlement
through the issuance of shares of Series C Common Stock in the name of, such
former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any
event not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), net of any Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 4.2(h); provided, however, that to the extent any
such payment or settlement would cause an impermissible acceleration event
under Section 409A, such amounts shall become vested at target levels of
achievement at the Effective Time and will be paid or settled at the earliest
time such payment would not cause an impermissible acceleration event under
Section 409A.

 

(d) _Continuing Awards_. Each Continuing Award shall be assumed and converted
automatically into a restricted stock unit relating to shares of Series C
Common Stock (a " _Parent Award_ ") entitling the holder to receive, on
substantially the same terms and conditions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, vesting) as were applicable under such Continuing Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Series C Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Series C Common Stock)
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such
Continuing Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y)
the Stock Award Consideration.

(e) _Phantom Stock Units_. Each phantom stock unit (each, a " _Phantom Unit_
") subject to the Company 2008 Deferred Compensation and Stock Plan for
Directors and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed converted into an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Phantom
Units in the Directors account, multiplied by (ii) the Cash Award
Consideration. The consideration payable under this Section 4.6(e) to each
former holder of a Phantom Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be paid to such former holder as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to
Section 4.2(h); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such payment
would cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A, such
amounts will be paid at the earliest time such payment would not cause an
impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A.

(f) _Further Action_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.6 and to ensure that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the Effective Time, no
Person shall have any right to acquire any securities of the Company or to
receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under any Company Stock Plan, except the right to receive a payment,
right or benefit with respect thereto as provided in this Section 4.6.

the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered
to Parent by the Company at the time of entering into this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any disclosure set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to, and shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds
in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent
the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect to such other section
or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure) or, as
disclosed in any Company Reports filed on or after January 1, 2017 and not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding all disclosures (other than statements of historical fact) in any
"Risk Factors" section and any disclosures included in any such Company
Reports that are cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature, it
being agreed that this parenthetical shall not apply to Sections 5.1(b) or
(d)), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of the respective articles of
incorporation and code of regulations (or comparable organizational documents)
of the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries as amended to and as
in effect on the date of this Agreement.

As used in this Agreement, (i) the term " _Subsidiary_ " means, with
respect to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such
Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the term " _Significant
Subsidiary_ " means any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
that constitutes a "significant subsidiary" of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X, (iii) the term
" _Affiliate_ " means, when used with respect to any party, any Person who is
an " _affiliate_ " of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act, (iv) " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, is materially adverse to the financial
condition, properties, assets, business or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any such event,
occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect resulting from or
arising out of: (1) changes in, or events generally affecting, the financial,

 



16  securities or capital markets, (2) general economic or political conditions
in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries operate, including any changes in currency exchange
rates, interest rates, monetary policy or inflation, (3) changes in, or events
generally affecting, the industries in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries operate, (4) any acts of war, sabotage, civil disobedience or
terrorism or natural disasters (including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or
earthquakes), (5) any failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
meet any internal or published projections, forecasts or predictions in
respect of financial performance for any period, (6) a decline in the price of
the Shares, or a change in the trading volume of the Shares, on the NASDAQ,
_provided_ that the exceptions in clauses (5) and (6) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any event, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect underlying such failure or decline or change (if
not otherwise falling within any of the exclusions pursuant to the
other clauses of this definition) has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (7) changes in Law, (8) changes in U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (or authoritative
interpretation thereof), (9) the taking of any specific action expressly
required by this Agreement or taken with Parents written consent to the
extent the effects thereof are reasonably explained in writing by the Company
prior to the time of such consent, or the failure to take any specific action
expressly prohibited by this Agreement and as for which Parent declined to
consent pursuant to Section 6.1(a), (10) the announcement or pendency (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not the consummation) of this Agreement and the
Merger, including the impact thereof on the relationships with customers,
suppliers (including production companies), talent, distributors, partners or
employees or (11) any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company or
Parent alleging breach of fiduciary duty or inadequate disclosure in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ that the events, facts, conditions, changes,
developments or effects set forth in the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (4),
(7) and (8) shall be taken into account in determining whether a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" has occurred to the extent such events, facts,
conditions, changes, developments or effects have a disproportionate adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to
other participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate and (v) the term " _Knowledge of the Company_ " means the actual
knowledge of the individuals identified on Section 5.1(a)(v) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (A) 240,000,000
Class A Shares, (B) 60,000,000 Common Voting Shares and (C) 25,000,000
preferred shares, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Shares_ "). As

33,850,481 Common Voting Shares were issued and outstanding and no Preferred
Shares were issued and outstanding on such date. All of the outstanding Shares
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and have been issued in compliance with all
applicable securities Laws. Section 5.1(b)(i)(A) of the Company Disclosure
Letter identifies each Company Plan pursuant to which Shares may be issued
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), which, for avoidance of doubt, are the only
Company Plans pursuant to which Shares may be issued, together with the
aggregate number of Class A Shares reserved for issuance under each such
Company Stock Plan and the aggregate number of such Class A Shares that are
subject to outstanding awards granted under each such Company Stock Plan.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence and except for Shares that

 



17  after the date hereof become reserved for issuance or subject to issuance as
permitted under this Agreement, the Company has no Shares reserved for, or
subject to, issuance. The Company has no Preferred Shares or other shares of
capital stock reserved for or subject to issuance (it being understood that
"other shares of capital stock" shall not include Shares). Section
5.1(b)(i)(B) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete
list as of July 27, 2017 of (x) the aggregate number and kind of Shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding unexercised Company Options
under the Company Stock Plans, including the applicable grant dates, exercise
prices and expiration dates for such Company Stock Options, the number of
Shares subject to outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units under the Company
Stock Plans, including the applicable grant and vesting schedule for such
Company Restricted Stock Units, and the aggregate number and kind of Shares
subject to issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Performance Stock Units
(assuming the achievement of performance criteria at both target and maximum
levels) under the Company Stock Plans, including the applicable grant dates
and performance criteria for such Company Performance Stock Units. The Company
has delivered or made available to Parent or Parents Representatives copies
of all Company Stock Plans, the forms of all stock option agreements
evidencing Company Options, the forms of all agreements evidencing the Company
Restricted Stock Units, Company Performance Stock Units and Phantom Units. No
Subsidiary of the Company holds shares of capital stock of the Company. The
Class A Shares constitute the only outstanding class of securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries registered under the Securities Act.

 

(ii) From the close of business on July 27, 2017 to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company has not issued any Shares except pursuant to the
exercise of Company Options or the settlement of Company Restricted Stock
Units or Company Performance Stock Units outstanding as of July 27, 2017, in
accordance with their terms and, since the close of business on July
27, 2017, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement for the period
following the date of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any Company
Options, Phantom Units, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Performance
Stock Units. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued
and fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any lien, charge,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ ").
Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of
the Companys Subsidiaries has been duly authorized and validly issued and is
fully paid and nonassessable, and has been issued in compliance with all
applicable securities Laws, and owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any Lien
(other than any Liens, except for Permitted Liens, for Taxes not yet due and
payable or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and as to which appropriate reserves have been recorded in the Companys
financial statements). Except as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i), as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption
rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or
rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
any equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
giving any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar
to or derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of

 



18  capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
The Company does not, and its Subsidiaries do not, have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company or its Subsidiaries on
any matter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company. There are no proxies,
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries of the Company is a party or is bound with respect to
the voting or registration of the capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(iii) Section 5.1(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
the date of this Agreement, (A) each of the Companys Subsidiaries, its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and the ownership interest of
the Company in each such Subsidiary and (B) any other Person in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may hold capital stock or other equity
interest that has a book value in excess of $10,000,000 (other than securities
held by any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any trustee, agent or other fiduciary in such capacity under any such
employee benefit plan). No Subsidiary of the Company owns any Shares.

 

(c) _Corporate Authority and Approval_. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger, subject only to (i) adoption of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A Shares entitled to vote
on such matter at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "
_Class A Requisite Vote_ "), (ii) the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Voting Shares entitled to vote
on such matter at a meeting duly called and held for such purposes (the "
_Common Shares Requisite Vote_ ") and (iii) the adoption of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company entitled to
vote thereon (together with the Class A Requisite Vote and the Common Shares
Requisite Vote, the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
the board of directors of the Company has (i) (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
shareholders, (B) approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (C) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, and (D) subject to
Section 6.2, resolved to recommend the adoption of this Agreement to the
holders of Class A Shares and to the holders of Common Voting Shares (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), and (ii) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption. The board of directors
of the Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested
shareholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" with the Company (in each case, as such term is used in Chapter
1704 of the OGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby. The
Company 

 



19  Requisite Vote is the only vote of holders of any class or series of capital
stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Law or
the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Code of Regulations.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

(i) Other than the necessary filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods or
authorizations (A) pursuant to Section 1.3, (B) required under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") or
any applicable foreign competition Laws (the " _Foreign Competition Laws_ ")

(the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), (C) to comply with state securities or "blue-sky" Laws
and (D) as may be required with or to foreign and transnational Governmental

from, any domestic, foreign, multinational or transnational governmental,
competition or regulatory authority, court, arbitral tribunal, commission,
body or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity or self-
regulatory agency (including any political subdivision thereof or any state-
owned or state-controlled enterprise) (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and/or the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, those that
the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
conflict with, a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, dated March 5, 2009 (the "
_Company Articles of Incorporation_ ") or the Amended and Restated Code of
Regulations, dated March 5, 2009 (the " _Company Code of Regulations_ ") or
the comparable governing instruments of any of its Significant Subsidiaries,
(B) with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, a
conflict with, a breach or violation of, a default or termination
or modification (or right of termination or modification) under, payment of
additional fees under, the loss of any benefit under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to (1) any
agreement, lease, license, contract, consent, settlement, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement, understanding or other obligation (" _Contracts_ ")
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, (2) assuming (solely
with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports,
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods
and authorizations referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i) are made or obtained and

 



20  receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, under any Law, Order or License to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in
the rights or obligations under any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above,
for any such breach, violation, default, termination, modification, payment,
acceleration, creation or change that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) The Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2015 (the
" _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed
with or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed with
or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, in each case
as amended, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the
time of its filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
course of such businesses consistent with past practice in all
material respects, and there has not been any action taken by the Company or

materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

(h)  _Employee Benefits_.

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Company Plan_ " shall mean

has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") and, to the Knowledge of the Company, circumstances
do not exist that are likely to result in the loss of the qualification of
such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each non-U.S. Company Plan to the extent required to be registered or
approved by any Governmental Entity, has been registered with, or approved by,
such Governmental Entity and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred that would adversely affect such registration or approval.

(iv) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be

them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ "), except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the

Pension Plan or by any Company ERISA Affiliate within the twelve (12) month

4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(vi) All contributions required to be made by the Company or its Subsidiaries
under each Company Plan and each Statutory Plan have been timely made and all
obligations in respect of each Company Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated
by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to

Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a Company
ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010

nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security
to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of a

respect to any Company Pension Plan subject to the minimum funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (1) no such

Section 303(i)(4)(A) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4)(A) of the Code), (2) no
unsatisfied liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of

to any payment or benefit to any Company Employee, officer or director, (ii)
materially increase the amount or value of any compensation or benefits under
any Company Plan or otherwise payable to any Company Employee, officer or

benefit will constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth on Section 5.1(h)(x) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or

Sub and/or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, those that the
failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the

prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger.

 



39 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub does not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the

under any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such

as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements, certifications,
reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the
SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since the Applicable
Date (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed with or furnished to
the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed with or furnished to the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, in each case as amended, the "

being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations

listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ.

 



40 (iv) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Parent in its filings with the SEC under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent has established and maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable,
under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting
provides reasonable assurance (A) regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, (B) that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the directors of Parent and (C) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents and
its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on Parents
financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of Parents board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Parent has made available prior to the date of this
Agreement to the Company (I) either materials relating to or a summary of
any disclosure of matters described in clauses (x) or (y) in the preceding
sentence made by management of Parent to its auditors and audit committee on
or after the Applicable Date and prior to the date of this Agreement and (II)
any material communication on or after the Applicable Date and prior to the
date of this Agreement made by management of Parent or its auditors to the
audit committee as required by the listing standards of the NASDAQ, the audit
committees charter or professional standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board. Since the Applicable Date, no complaints from any
source regarding a material violation of accounting procedures, internal
accounting controls or auditing matters or compliance with Law, including
from employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries regarding questionable
accounting, auditing or legal compliance matters have, to the Knowledge of
Parent, been received by Parent.

 

(v) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)

Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as of the date
of such balance sheet, and each of the consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and changes in stockholders equity (deficit) included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after
the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material
respects, the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that are not or will not be
material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP

 



41  consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein or in the notes thereto. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes and schedules) included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods indicated (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under
the Exchange Act).

(vi) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any Indebtedness,
or issued or sold any debt securities or rights to acquire any debt security
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the terms of which, or the terms of any
instrument under which such Indebtedness, debt securities or rights were
issued, requires the public listing of such Indebtedness, debt securities or
rights or the maintenance by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of registration
under the Exchange Act.

(vii) None of Parent or its consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to or has
any obligation or other commitment to become a party to any securitization
transaction, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity, on the
other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent in any of Parents
published financial statements or other Parent Reports.

 

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2016 through the date of
this Agreement, there has not been any effect, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect which has had or would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Since March 31, 2017 and through the date of this Agreement, Parent and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course
of such businesses consistent with past practice in all material respects, and
there has not been any action taken by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time without the Companys consent, would constitute a
breach of, or require consent of the Company under, Section 6.1(b).

 

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or against any present or former officer or director of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in such individuals capacity as such, except for
those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no obligations or
liabilities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed,
reflected, reserved against or otherwise provided for in the consolidated
balance sheet of Parent as of March 31, 2017 and the notes thereto set forth
in Parents quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March
31, 2017 (the " _Parent Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since March 31, 2017; (iii) liabilities or obligations arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iv) liabilities or
obligations that

 



42  would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or subject to the provisions of any Order, stipulation or
settlement of or with any Governmental Entity that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(except to the extent expressly consented to by Parent pursuant to Section
6.6) or that would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of Parent to consummate the Merger.

(h)  _Compliance with Laws, Licenses_. The businesses of each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries since the Applicable Date have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any applicable Law or Order, except for such
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any Governmental
Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for such
investigations or reviews the outcome of which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and its Subsidiaries possess
each License necessary to conduct their respective businesses, since
the Applicable Date have been in compliance with all terms and conditions of
such Licenses, no such Licenses are subject to any actual or possible
revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification,
and since the Applicable Date have not received written notice from any
Governmental Entity alleging a conflict with or breach of any License.

or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (A) have prepared in good faith and
duly and timely filed all income and franchise Tax Returns and all other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and all such filed
Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all respects; (B) have paid all
Taxes that are required to be paid (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns)
or that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from
amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party, except with respect
to matters contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been
established in accordance with GAAP on the books of Parent; and (C) as of the
date of this Agreement have not waived any statute of limitations with
respect to U.S. federal income or material U.S. state income or franchise
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a U.S. federal income
or material U.S. state income or franchise Tax assessment or deficiency.

 

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened audits, examinations, investigations or other
proceedings in respect of Taxes. There are not, to the Knowledge of Parent,
any claims or assessments (whether or not asserted in writing) by any Tax
authority concerning Parents or any of its Subsidiaries liability for Tax.

 

(j) _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time
during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company as defined in section 1704.01 of the OGCL.

 



43 (k) _Brokers and Finders_. Parent has not employed any broker or finder or

transactions contemplated in this Agreement, except that Parent has engaged
Guggenheim Securities, LLC and Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC as Parents financial
advisors.

(l) _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete fully
executed copies of (i) the commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof,
among Parent, Discovery Communications, LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank, USA and
Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (the " _Commitment Letter_ "), and (ii)
the fee letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Discovery
Communications, LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank, USA and Goldman Sachs Lending
Partners LLC (as redacted to remove the fee amounts, alternate
transaction fee provisions, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in
the "market flex" and other economic terms that could not adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability or termination of the Financing, the "
_Redacted Fee Letter_ "), in each case, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Letters_ "), pursuant to which and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof each of the parties thereto
(other than Parent) have severally committed to lend the amounts set forth
therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, the "
_Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Debt Letters. The Debt
Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the
existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Redacted
Fee Letter shall not be deemed to constitute a modification or amendment of
the Commitment Letter), and the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Letters, to the Knowledge of Parent, have not been withdrawn, rescinded,
amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent, Discovery Communications, LLC and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject in each case to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to
general principles of equity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing pursuant to the Debt Letters, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Letters and, after the date of this Agreement, such
other conditions and contingencies with respect to the Financing permitted
pursuant to Section 6.16. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Letters and assuming that each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 of this Agreement is satisfied at Closing, the net proceeds
contemplated from the Financing, together with other financial resources of
Parent, including contemplated cash on hand of Parent, will, in the
aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and
all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably constitute a breach
or default on the part of Parent under the Debt Letters or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other party to the Debt Letters (assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties and undertakings under this Agreement
for such purpose). As of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters
or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Letters. Parent has fully paid all 

 



44  commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming (x) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, (y)
the performance of all obligations and compliance with all covenants and
agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with at or
prior to the Closing by the Company in all material respects and (z) that each
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of this Agreement
is satisfied at Closing, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied, or to the Knowledge of
Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Letters.

(m) _Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not, at the date it is filed with the
SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain (by incorporation or otherwise) any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form
S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (as applicable) and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 

(n) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Section 5.2, Parent
and Merger Sub are not making and have not made, and no other Person is making
or has made on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, any express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and shall

accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, along with
such directors, officers and employees, " _Representatives_ ") not to,

facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal;

Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
terminate access by any such Person to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of any
"standstill" agreement between the Company and any Person (other than
Parent), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or
modification to, any such agreement, to permit such person to submit a Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not restrict the
Company from permitting a Person to orally

 



52  request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from granting
such a waiver, in each case, to the extent the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior to the time, but not after,
the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal which did not
result from a breach, in any material respect, of this Section 6.2 and so long
as it has provided prior written notice to Parent, (i) provide access to non-
public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to
Parent substantially concurrently with the making of such information
available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such material non-
public information, the Company receives from the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least
as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality
Agreements terms are on Parent (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of a
Company Acquisition Proposal), and (ii) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding such
Company Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any action
described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
(A) based on the information then available and after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Company
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In no event may the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives directly or indirectly
reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses
of, or provide or agree to provide any compensation to, any Person or group
(or any of its or their Representatives or potential financing sources) who
makes a Company Acquisition Proposal.

four (24) hours) notify Parent if (i) any written or other bona fide
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
are received by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested in
connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal from the Company or (iii)
any discussions or negotiation with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of
this Section 6.2 and the Companys board of directors determining in good
faith, after consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal,
the Companys board of directors may, at any time prior to the time the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Company Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 6.2(f)(ii), or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take

written Company Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition

Company Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.3(c) in order to enter into the Company Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to making such a Company
Change in Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.3(c), as applicable, (x) used commercially reasonable efforts to
engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage)
during such notice

such that the Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, and (y) in determining whether to make a Company
Change in Recommendation and/or to effect such a termination in accordance
with Section 8.3(c), the board of directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any
other information provided by Parent in response to such notice; and

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined, in good faith,
after consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Proposal
and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Company
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
Company Change in Recommendation or to so terminate this Agreement in

directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) _Company Change in Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the

information describing the Company Intervening Event and the rationale for the

a Company Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Company
Change in Recommendation, used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such
four (4) Business Day period to consider adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the
Companys board of directors to make a Company Change in Recommendation in
response to the Company Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii)
below would no longer be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and

 

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that in light of such Company
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by
Parent, the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation, would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard
to a Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop look and listen"
communication to its stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act shall include an affirmative statement to the effect
that the recommendation of the Companys board of directors is affirmed or
remains unchanged; 

 



56   _provided_ , _further_ , that this paragraph (h) shall not be deemed to
permit the Company or the Companys board of directors to effect a Company
Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(f). The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company
Acquisition Proposal or Company Superior Proposal prior to the termination of

from permitting a Person to orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or
similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the
extent Parents board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

material non-public information, Parent receives from the Person making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms
at least as restrictive in all material respects on

 



57  such Person as the Confidentiality Agreements terms are on the Company (it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the
making or amending of a Parent Acquisition Proposal); and (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding
such Parent Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any action
described in clause (i) or (ii) above, Parents board of directors determines

the information then available and after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation that such Parent Acquisition Proposal

Affiliates_ " shall mean the Persons set forth on Section 6.3(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter.

 



58 " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means any event, occurrence, fact, condition,

definition).

 

" _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide binding written offer (not
solicited by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives or otherwise resulting in violation of
Section 6.3(a)) made by a third party after the date of this Agreement that,

Recommendation_ "), (ii) cause or permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, lease agreement or other agreement

the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into a Parent Alternative

59 (f) _Fiduciary Exception to Parent Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.3(e),
following receipt of a written Parent Acquisition Proposal by Parent after the
date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this
Section 6.3 and Parents board of directors determining in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, Parents board
of directors may, at any time prior to the time the Parent Requisite Vote is
obtained, make a Parent Change in Recommendation with respect to such Parent
Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.3(f)(ii), or authorize,
resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, if all of the
following conditions are met:

(i) Parent shall have (A) provided to the Company four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
written Parent Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Parent Superior
Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Parent Acquisition
Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person or group making the Parent Acquisition Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Parent Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial
documents) related to the Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or
condition of such Parent Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an
additional three (3) Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii)
below, Parents board of directors has determined to effect a Parent Change in
Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Parent Change in Recommendation
(x) used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with the
Company (to the extent the Company wishes to engage) during such notice period
to consider adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that the Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a
Parent Superior Proposal, and (y) in determining whether to make a Parent
Change in Recommendation, the board of directors of Parent shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company
and any other information provided by the Company in response to such notice;
and

 

(ii) Parents board of directors shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation,
that, in light of such Parent Superior Proposal and taking into account any
revised terms proposed by the Company, such Parent Superior Proposal continues
to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Parent Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(g) _Parent Change in Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in Section 6.3(e), upon the occurrence of any Parent
Intervening Event, Parents board of directors may, at any time prior to the
time the Parent Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Parent Change in
Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:

 



60 (i) Parent shall have (A) provided to the Company four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Parent Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Parent Change in Recommendation, as the case may be, and (2) state expressly
that, subject to clause (ii) below, Parents board of directors has
determined to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making
such a Parent Change in Recommendation, used commercially reasonable efforts
to engage in good faith with the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to
engage) during such five (5) Business Day period to consider adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the failure
of Parents board of directors to make a Parent Change in Recommendation in
response to the Parent Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below
would no longer be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

 

(ii) Parents board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation, that in light of such Parent Intervening Event and
taking into account any revised terms proposed by the Company, the failure to
make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section
6.3 shall be deemed to prohibit Parent from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop look and listen" communication
to its stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act shall include an affirmative statement to the effect that the
recommendation of Parents board of directors is affirmed or remains
unchanged; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that this paragraph (h) shall not be
deemed to permit Parent or Parents board of directors to effect a Parent
Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.3(f).

 

6.4 _Information Supplied_. (a) The Company and Parent shall jointly prepare
and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ")
with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, in connection
with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Series C
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or
filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Series C Common Stock in the Merger. Each of the Company
and Parent shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Shares and Parent and the holders of the capital stock of
Parent, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys
shareholders and Parents stockholders, as applicable, as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
and in connection with the mailing of the Form of Election.

 



61 (b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case
without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (other than, in each case, any filing, amendment or
supplement in connection with a Change in Recommendation), and each party
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other
party. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other
with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to the extent not
readily publicly available. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other and provide
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by such other party to
be included therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with
the other in the preparation of the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus, as applicable, and the resolution of any comments to either
received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Requisite Vote or the Parent Requisite Vote, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company or
the stockholders of Parent, as applicable. The parties shall notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply
each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus
or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4. No
response to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will be made by either party without
providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC, and each party shall
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other party.
The parties will cause the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

6.5 _Shareholder and Stockholder Meetings_.

 

(a) _Company Family Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance with the
Amended and Restated Scripps Family Agreement, dated May 19, 2015, as amended
(the " _Scripps Family Agreement_ "), duly call and give notice of, and
convene as promptly as practicable, a meeting of the holders of Common Voting
Shares who are signatories to the Scripps Family Agreement (the " _Company
Family Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the proxies required for the
Common Shares Requisite Vote and the Company Requisite Vote. Subject to the
provisions of Section 6.2, the Companys board of directors shall recommend
at the Company Family Meeting that the holders of Common Voting Shares adopt
this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. A copy of this
Agreement or a summary thereof shall be sent to the holders of Common Voting
Shares who are signatories to the Scripps Family Agreement with the notice of
the Company Family Meeting.

 



62 (b) _Company Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(i) The Company will, as promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Code of
Regulations, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and
use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Shares to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ) following the conclusion of the Company Family
Meeting. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, the Companys board of
directors shall include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus and recommend at the Company Shareholders Meeting that
the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
on or before the date on which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled,
the Company reasonably believes that (i) it will not receive proxies
representing the Company Requisite Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or
(ii) it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of, the Company Shareholders Meeting as long as the date of
the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an
aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days in connection with any postponements
or adjournments in reliance on the preceding sentence. In addition,
notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6.5(b), the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
shareholders of the Company prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to (i) the holders of Shares for adoption
at the Company Shareholders Meeting and (ii) the holders of Common Voting
Shares at the Company Family Meeting (in accordance with Section 6.5(a))
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by the
Companys shareholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

 



63 (c) _Parent Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(i) Parent will, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give
notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene and hold a meeting
of holders of capital stock of Parent to consider and vote upon the issuance
of Series C Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Parent
Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable. Subject to the
provisions of Section 6.3, the Parent board of directors shall include the
Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and recommend
at the Parent Stockholders Meeting that the holders of capital stock of
Parent approve the issuance of the Series C Common Stock in connection with
the Merger and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit
such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on a date preceding the date
on which or the date on which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
Parent reasonably believes that (i) it will not receive proxies representing
the Parent Requisite Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (ii) it
will not have enough shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock
represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent may postpone or adjourn, or make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Parent Stockholders
Meeting as long as the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days in
connection with any postponements or adjournments in reliance on the
preceding sentence. In addition, notwithstanding the first sentence of this
Section 6.5(c), Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting
to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to
be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting.

(ii) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent shall
nonetheless seek the Parent Requisite Vote at the Parent Stockholders Meeting
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII prior to
the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by Parents
stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby)
that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of Parent at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting.

6.6 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3, cooperate
with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Laws and Orders to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as expeditiously as possible, including (i) preparing and filing all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (and
in any event, by filing within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement the notifications, filings and other information required to be
filed under the HSR Act and as promptly as practicable in the case of all
other filings required under any Foreign Competition Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, which are set forth Section 7.1(b)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter) and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of
the 

 



64  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) satisfying the
conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating
with each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any
exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Merger and (v) executing
and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 6.6(c), in the event that the parties receive a request
for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws (a " _Second Request_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by the
Company, the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an
appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request
as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process.
Neither Party shall agree to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity to delay the transactions contemplated hereby except with prior written
consent of the other Party. None of the Parties shall knowingly take, cause or
permit to be taken or omit to take any action which such party reasonably
expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the
contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust
Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act and all other federal,
state and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws
and Orders that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or competition.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws
and shall have joint decision making authority with respect to obtaining the
required consents under the Antitrust Laws and otherwise hereunder, including
pursuant to this Section 6.6;  _provided_ that in the event of any good faith
disagreement, the determination of Parent shall be final and conclusive. No
Party or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive call
or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in
respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the
other Party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall notify the other, as far in
advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication
or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to make with any
Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Section 6.6, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or making any such
communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith
the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of such
filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a
copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry and
(iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry,
hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any
Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating
thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the

 



65  Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to
this Section 6.6 may be reasonably redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, (C) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns or (D) as otherwise required by Law.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.6, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of
this Section 6.6, "reasonable best efforts" shall include taking any and all
actions necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period
expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to
consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date, including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate,
and other disposition of the businesses, assets, products or equity interests
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of Parents or its Subsidiaries
other businesses, assets, products or equity interests now owned or hereafter
acquired by Parent, (ii) creating, terminating, or amending any existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (iii) otherwise taking
or committing to any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any
businesses, assets, products or equity interests of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) and (iv) making, or causing
any Subsidiaries to make, any commitment, or committing to (or causing any
Subsidiaries to commit to) make any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or
otherwise) regarding the future operations of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) (the " _Regulatory Actions_
"); _provided_ that (x) the Company shall not accept or agree to any
Regulatory Action without Parents express written consent and (y) Parent
shall not be required to accept or agree to any Regulatory Action that would
result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, either individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent, the Company, and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger.
Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to
its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing. The parties shall jointly control the
process and strategy for pursuing any such Regulatory Actions; _provided_ that
in the event of any good faith disagreement, the determination of Parent
shall be final and conclusive.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

 



66 (f) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Form S-4,
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(g) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.

 

6.7 _Access; Consultation_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford the other partys
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to the other partys, and each of its
Subsidiaries employees, properties, assets, books, records and contracts and,
during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries capital stock,
business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by the other; _provided_
that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; and
_provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing shall require neither the Company
nor Parent to permit any invasive environmental sampling or any inspection or
to disclose any information pursuant to this Section 6.7 to the extent that
(i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, any applicable Law
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of
such party, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a
third party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , _further_ that
with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.7(a), Parent or
the Company, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such
inspection or disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company and (3) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii),
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure
of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection,
including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or
entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information
to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably
permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the other party. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or such Person as may be designated by any
such executive officer.

 



67 (b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other
as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be
subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between
the parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.7 or otherwise in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention
and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended

product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under applicable Law
and, to the extent identified, shall cooperate in taking commercially
reasonable actions or practices and other customary actions to reduce the
risks related to such actions where the failure to remediate would reasonably
be likely to result in substantial fines or penalties.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another of
event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect that would
reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any reasonably likely failure
of any condition to Parents or the Companys obligations to effect the
Merger (as applicable).

6.8 _Stock Exchange Listing, De-listing and De-registration_. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Series C Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any other security issued
by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed on the NASDAQ to be de-
listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
possible following the Effective Time.

6.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any

 



68  national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ, (ii) any
consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of
requirements of applicable Law, (iii) any press release or public statement
that in the good faith judgment of the applicable party is consistent with
prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance with this
Section 6.9 or (iv) with respect to any Company Change in Recommendation or
Parent Change in Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement or the
other partys response thereto.

6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each Company Employee who continues to remain employed
with the Company or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2018 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), be
provided with (i) an annual rate of base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the base salary or base wages provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus
opportunities (excluding one-time incentives, transaction-based incentive
opportunities, other similar extraordinary compensation arrangements and, for
the avoidance of doubt, equity-based compensation) provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2019, Parent will consider Continuing Employees for
participation in Parents long-term equity incentive program, as appropriate.
Participation, including eligibility, level and terms and conditions of
awards, will be determined in Parents sole discretion. Parent agrees
that Continuing Employees shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided
with pension, welfare and other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, annual and long-term
incentive opportunities and equity-based compensation). Additionally, Parent
agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Time,
be provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Employee under the Company Plans set forth on Section 6.10(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (or such greater benefits as are required
after giving effect to the acknowledgment in Section 6.10(d)). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall limit the ability of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) to provide compensation and benefits to Continuing Employees
(other than compensation and benefits provided under employment agreements
and severance plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) in
accordance with this Agreement through plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods that could otherwise
apply to any Company Employee under the benefit plans provided for such
Company Employee following the Closing, except to the extent 

 



69  such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were applicable to the
Company Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the plan year
during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide each Company
Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Parent plan in which such Company Employee is eligible
to participate following the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, provide credit to Company Employees for their service
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous service, determination of service
awards, vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements (but excluding
benefit accruals under any (i) defined benefit plan (other than with respect
to current Company Employee participants under the Scripps Networks
Interactive Pension Plan or Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan, with respect to their accruals thereunder) or (ii)
post-employment health and welfare plan) to the same extent and for the same
purposes as such service was credited under the Company Plans, _provided_
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change in control"
or "change of control" (or other similar phrase) for purposes of any Company
Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change of control"
(or similar phrase), as applicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Continuing Employee who
becomes, subject to a CBA, all compensation and benefits treatment and terms
and conditions of employment afforded to such Company Employee shall be
provided in accordance with such collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement with a labor union or like organization and the terms of this
Section 6.10 shall not apply.

(f) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to honor all obligations under the employment agreements, severance
plans and retention arrangements listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect on the date
hereof or, to the extent modified in compliance with Section 6.1(a)(iii), as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(g) (i) Prior to the Effective Time, if the Effective Time would otherwise
occur before the end of the then-current purchase period under the ESPP (the "
_Current Purchase Period_ "), the Company will shorten such Current Purchase
Period as of a specified trading day occurring at least ten (10) days prior
to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; and (ii) in all events, the
Company shall terminate the ESPP prior to the Effective Time.

 

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other Person, including any union, current
or former employee, participant in any Company Plan or other dependent,
beneficiary or other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in

 



70  Section 9.8), no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i)
constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any Company Plan or any
employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan, any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10, (iv) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from
terminating the employment of any Company Employee or (v) be deemed to confer
upon any such individual or legal representative any right to continued
employment or any rights under or with respect to any plan, program or
arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement, and each such
individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look only to the
express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights
thereunder.

 

6.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.16, 8.5 and 8.6,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense.

 

6.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company
to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Person prior to the Effective Time, in each case, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under Ohio Law, any
applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the
Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Code of Regulations in effect on
the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent and the
Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). Parent shall ensure that the organizational documents of the
Surviving Company shall, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
than are presently set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation and
Company Code of Regulations. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Party as provided herein.

 



71 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ that in
no event shall the Company expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits
and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to expend for such policies, an annual amount in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the
premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Company
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this Section 6.12.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section
6.12 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under Ohio
Law, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a
party, the Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company Code of
Regulations.

(e) Neither of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

 



72 (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.12 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.13 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

6.14 _Control of the Company s or Parents Operations_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision of its operations.

 

6.15 _Section 16(b)_. The board of directors of each of the Company and Parent
(or, in each case, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company and acquisitions of
equity securities of Parent (including derivative securities) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
a director or executive officer of the Company or is or may become a director
or executive officer of Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

6.16  _Financing by Parent_.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to consummate the Financing or any Substitute
Financing no later than the Closing Date, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Debt Letters and in all material
respects comply with all of their respective obligations thereunder and (B)
negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing reflecting the terms contained in the Debt Letters (including any
"flex" provisions in the Redacted Fee Letter) (or with other terms agreed by
Parent and the Financing Parties, subject to the restrictions on amendments of
the Debt Letters set forth below), so that such agreements are in effect no
later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that
are in Parents control. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, in each case, all things necessary, proper or advisable to maintain a
credit rating for the non-credit-enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt of
Discovery Communications, LLC of BBB- or higher by SandP or Baa3 or higher by
Moodys during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement through and
including the Closing Date, including supplying as promptly as practicable
any additional information and

 



73  documentary material that may be formally or informally requested by either
SandP or Moodys; _provided_ , that if notwithstanding Parents use of
reasonable best efforts to maintain such rating, a change of control offer
would be required to be made pursuant to the existing senior unsecured notes
of the Company issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of December 1, 2011,
with U.S. Bank, National Association as trustee, as supplemented prior to the
date hereof (such notes, the " _Existing Notes_ "), Parent may commence prior
to the Closing Date a consent solicitation to waive such change of control
offer, a Notes Tender Offer and/or a Notes Exchange Offer, and to the extent
such consent solicitation, Notes Tender Offer, and/or Notes Exchange Offer
with respect to the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Notes cannot
reasonably be expected to be effectuated on or prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain backstop commitments
from the Financing Sources or other lenders in an aggregate principal amount
sufficient to commence such required change of control offer with respect to
the Companys Existing Notes, and (ii) (A) obtain, on or prior to the Closing
Date, an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility in order to permit the
Merger, the incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the date such amendment becomes
effective, the " _Amendment Effective Date_ ") and (B) if notwithstanding
Parents use of reasonable best efforts to obtain such amendment pursuant to
clause (A) of this clause (ii), such amendment is not reasonably expected to
be effective on or prior to the Closing Date, repay all outstanding amounts,
and terminate all unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on or
prior to the Closing Date. In the event that all conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding of the
Financing shall be satisfied or waived, Parent and its Affiliates shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing the Financing
(the " _Financing Parties_ ") to fund on the Closing Date the Financing, to
the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall, promptly after it comes
to the Knowledge of Parent, give the Company written notice of any (A)
material breach or default by a Financing Party or any party to any definitive
document related to the Financing of the Debt Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing, (B) actual or threatened withdrawal,
repudiation or termination in writing of the Debt Letters or the Financing by
the Financing Parties or (C) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to
the Financing with respect to the obligations to fund the Financing or the
amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing; _provided_ , that neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the
extent such privilege is asserted in good faith or otherwise would violate or
contravene any Law or any obligation of confidentiality. Parent may amend,
modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt
Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, _provided_ , that
Parent shall not, without Companys prior written consent, permit any such
amendment, replacement, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be
made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the
Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) such that the aggregate funds that would be available to Parent on
the Closing Date, together with other financial resources of Parent, would not
be sufficient to provide the funds required to be funded on the Closing Date
to consummate the Merger and to pay all fees and expenses reasonably expected
to be incurred in connection therewith and payable on the Closing Date, or (B)
impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand any
of the conditions to the Financing

 



74 or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters
in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (1)
materially delay or make materially less likely the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (2)
materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (3) materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Letters as of the date of this Agreement. In
the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in
accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this Section 6.16(a), such new
commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be the "Debt Letters"
for all purposes of this Agreement and references to "Financing" herein shall
include and mean the financing contemplated by the Debt Letters as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, as applicable. To the
extent that after giving effect to any reduction in the Financing permitted by
this Section 6.16(a), no commitments remain outstanding under the Debt
Letters, Parent may terminate the Debt Letters. Parent shall promptly deliver
to the Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Debt Letters. If funds in the amounts set forth in the
Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event to (x) notify the Company in writing thereof, (y)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing (on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent, taken as a whole,
than the terms and conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking into
account any "market flex" provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the
Closing Date in accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and
(z) use reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new
commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably
satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing removing the
fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex"
and other economic terms that could not adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability or termination of the Financing) and related definitive
financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining
any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be
deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment letter for such
Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of
this Agreement. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall
become due and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable
under the Debt Letters. The term " _Revolving Credit Facility_ " shall mean
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2016 (as
amended though the date hereof), among Parent, certain subsidiaries of Parent,
the lenders from time to time parties thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as
administrative agent.

 

(b) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take any actions reasonably requested by
Parent that are necessary to facilitate the payoff, satisfaction, discharge
and/or defeasance by Parent of the Companys Indebtedness (the " _Debt Payoff_
"), including sending one or more notices of payment 

 



75  required by the terms of such Indebtedness and obtaining a payoff letter in
connection therewith; it being understood that at Closing, Parent shall
provide all funds required to actually effect the Debt Payoff. In addition,
and solely at the expense of Parent, if requested by Parent in writing with
reasonable notice, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
commence, assist in and effectuate, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
any conditions thereto, any consent solicitation in connection with any
amendment, waiver and/or consent or, if such amendment, waiver or consent is
not obtained, to assist Parent with an exchange offer by Parent of the
Companys outstanding debt securities for new debt of Parent (the "Notes
Exchange Offer") or tender offer by Parent for the Companys outstanding debt
securities (the "Notes Tender Offer"), in each case with respect to
the Companys outstanding debt securities, including the preparation of
customary consent solicitation statements, the execution of customary
solicitation agent agreements and any other customary agreements, the
engagement of such agents and other service providers as are customary, and
the prompt execution and delivery of any amendment or supplement to the
relevant indentures to effectuate such amendment, waiver and/or consent and it
being further understood that no Notes Exchange Offer or Notes Tender Offer
shall be effectuated prior to the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, use its or their respective reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent
all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Financing or consummation of an offering of debt, equity or equity-linked
securities in replacement of all or any portion of the Financing (the "
_Permanent Financing_ "), including: (i) delivering to Parent financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as may be reasonably requested by Parent and that is customarily required for
financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Permanent
Financing (collectively, the " _Required Information_ "), including (A) the
audited and unaudited financial statements referred to in paragraphs (5)(a)
and (5)(b) of Exhibit B to the Commitment Letter (it being understood that the
Companys public filing with the SEC of any such financial statements will
satisfy such requirements) and (B) such information reasonably requested by
Parent to prepare the pro forma financial statements referred to in paragraph
(5) of Exhibit B to the Commitment Letter including fourth quarter financial
information, if necessary, and providing an opportunity to discuss such
information with the Company; (ii) informing Parent if the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have knowledge of any facts that would likely require
the restatement of any financial statements included in the Required
Information in order for such financial statements to comply with GAAP; (iii)
using reasonable best efforts, to the extent customarily required for
financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Permanent
Financing, to make appropriate officers available to participate in a
reasonable number of due diligence sessions, marketing efforts and sessions
with rating agencies; (iv) cooperating with any customary due diligence
requests by Parent, the Financing Parties and their respective legal counsel;
(v) using reasonable best efforts to provide reasonable and customary
representations and authorization letters to Parent or the Financing Parties
in connection with the preparation of customary offering documents, including

connection with the Financing or the Permanent Financing;

 



76  (vi) if reasonably requested in writing by the Financing Parties, furnish to
such Financing Parties at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date
all information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
required in connection with the Financing or the Permanent Financing by U.S.
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act; (vii) assisting
Parent in obtaining corporate, corporate family, credit, facility and
securities ratings from rating agencies to the extent necessary or advisable
for Parent to obtain such ratings; (viii) obtaining (A) customary auditor
consents (including consents with respect to inclusion of the Companys

Report on Form 8-K, registration statement, prospectus or offering memorandum
or similar documents for any portion of the Financing or the Permanent
Financing) and (B) customary comfort letters of the Companys independent
accountants (including "negative assurance" comfort), including by executing
and delivering any customary representation letters to the accountants in
connection therewith, in each case, to the extent financial statements of the
Company are included in such registration statement, prospectus or offering
memorandum); (ix) cooperating with Parents and Merger Subs legal counsel and
causing the Companys legal counsel to cooperate in connection with, and as
reasonably requested providing, any legal opinions that may be required in

by Parent in connection with the Financing, the Permanent Financing and any
consent solicitation, Notes Exchange Offer or Notes Tender Offer.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.16,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or
permit the taking of any action that would (i) unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause
any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) require the Company or any of its

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 27, 2017, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (a) as provided in Section 6.12
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (b) the right of the
Companys shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing,
(c) the right of the holders of awards under the Company Stock Plans to
receive such consideration as provided for in Section 4.5 after the Closing,
(d) Sections 8.5 and 8.6, and (e) Sections 8.7(c), 9.2 and 9.5 which, to the
extent applicable to the Financing Parties (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives), are intended to benefit,
and be enforceable by, the Financing Parties (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives).

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision negotiated in good faith by the parties hereto shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not, subject to clause (a) above, be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such
substitution, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

 



89 9.11 _Interpretation_. (a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and
paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only,
do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this
Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in this
Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if". All terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made
or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law
or otherwise; _provided_ that Parent may designate, prior to the Effective
Time, by written notice to the Company, another Subsidiary to be a party to
the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary (except
with respect to representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2(b)(ii)) as of the
date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that such assignment
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
such other Subsidiary. Any assignment in contravention of the preceding
sentence shall be null and void.

 



90 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at Law if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in accordance
with Section 9.5 of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each
party hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any
such breach or that the Company or Parent otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law.
