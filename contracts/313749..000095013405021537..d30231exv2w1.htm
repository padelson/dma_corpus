to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the Mergers and to cooperate with each other in connection with the

consents, approvals, orders, exemptions and authorizations by or from any public or private third

state or local Law or any Contract to which the Company, Properties or any
La Quinta Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound, to defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers, to effect all necessary registrations and Other Filings, including,
but not limited to, filings under the HSR Act, if any, and submissions of information requested
by a Governmental Entity, and to use its best efforts to cause to be lifted or rescinded any
Order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the Mergers.
In the event that any of the La Quinta Entities or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries shall fail
to obtain any third party consent described above, the La Quinta Entity or such La Quinta
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize the adverse effect upon the La Quinta Entities

from any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be
