modify in any respect the obligations of Parent, Company MergerCo or
Properties MergerCo under this Agreement, including payment of the Merger
Consideration. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the La Quinta Entities,
reimburse the La Quinta Entities for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the La Quinta Entities in connection with any actions taken by

expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with such actions, including any losses resulting from the
failure of Properties to qualify as a REIT as a result of any such action.

covenants of the La Quinta Entities shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the transactions contemplated by this Section
1.6 and any such breach or violation shall be disregarded for purposes of
Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b).

     #####

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Each share of Properties Class A Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Properties Excluded Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Properties Surviving Corporation (" _Properties Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ").

In the event that any of the La Quinta Entities or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, the La Quinta Entity or such La Quinta Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize the adverse effect upon the La Quinta Entities and Parent and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, none of the La Quinta Entities or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation due to such person and (ii) none of Parent, Company MergerCo or Properties MergerCo or their respective affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to incur any Liability or other obligation.

 (d) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

   

 7.4 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 9.2 hereof, whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by, or on behalf of, any party or its affiliates, in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of Representatives and hedging counterparties (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses. 

  

 7.5 _No Solicitations_. 

  

 (a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the La Quinta Entities and the La Quinta Subsidiaries will, and will direct their Representatives to, terminate and cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The La Quinta Entities shall promptly request that each person who has executed a confidentiality agreement with the La Quinta Entities prior to date hereof in connection with that persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that person by or on behalf of the La Quinta Entities in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement. The La Quinta Entities shall take reasonable steps to promptly inform their Representatives of the La Quinta Entities obligations under this Section 7.5 and to instruct their Representatives to notify the La Quinta Entities as promptly as practicable following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Except as specifically permitted by Sections 7.5(c) and 7.5(e), none of the Company, Properties or the La Quinta Subsidiaries shall, nor shall they authorize any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries, offers or proposals relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company, Properties or the La Quinta Subsidiaries to, any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation or the Properties Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, Company MergerCo or Properties MergerCo, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) enter into any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding or Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal (except for a confidentiality agreement as described in the last sentence of Section 7.5(c)). 

   

 (c) Subject to the La Quinta Entities compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.5, and only until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company, Properties, the Company Board and Properties Board shall be permitted to, in response to the receipt by any of them of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.5, furnish non-public information with respect to the Company, Properties and the La Quinta Subsidiaries to the person who made such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Third Party_ ") and participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal if prior to the taking of any such action (A) the Company Board and/or the Properties Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (in the case of the Company Board) or Properties (in the case of the Properties Board) under applicable Law, (B) the Company Board and/or the Properties Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with its advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) the La Quinta Entities have (1) caused such person to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the La Quinta Entities on terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) concurrently disclose the same such non-public information to Parent if not previously disclosed. 

   

 (d) The Company or Properties, as the case may be, shall notify Parent in writing promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) upon receipt by the La Quinta Entities or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries (including through a notification by their Representatives) of (i) an Acquisition Proposal or indication by any person considering making an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for information relating to the Company, Properties or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company or Properties, as the case may be, shall provide Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) in writing with the identity of such person and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request, including any modifications thereto (or, where no such copy is available, a description of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request). The La Quinta Entities shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request, and any related communications to or by the La Quinta Entities or their Representatives (the La Quinta Entities agreeing that they shall not, and they shall cause the 

    ##### 

  

    

La Quinta Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the La
Quinta Entities from providing such information to Parent). The La Quinta
Entities shall not, and they shall cause each of the La Quinta Subsidiaries
not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing
standstill or confidentiality agreement to which either of the La Quinta
Entities or any of the La Quinta Subsidiaries is a party and the La Quinta
Entities shall, and shall cause the La Quinta Subsidiaries to, enforce
the provisions of any such agreement. 

   

 (e) Subject to the Companys or Properties, as the case may be, compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 and only until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board and Properties Board shall each be permitted to (i) in response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, approve, endorse, or recommend a written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 7.5 and, in connection therewith, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation or the Properties Board Recommendation, as the case may be, in a manner adverse to Parent, if the Company Board and/or the Properties Board, as applicable, (A) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such actions are necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (in the case of the Company Board) or Properties (in the case of the Properties Board) under applicable Law, or (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, withdraw, modify or amend the Board Recommendations in a manner adverse to Parent, if the Company Board and/or the Properties Board, as applicable, has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that taking such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (in the case of the Company Board) or Properties (in the case of the Properties Board) under applicable Law. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prohibit the Company or Properties from at any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the La Quinta Entities nor their respective boards of directors shall (x) recommend that the stockholders of either of the La Quinta Entities tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (y) withdraw, modify or amend the Board Recommendations, unless in each case, the requirements of Section 7.5(e) have been satisfied. 

   

 (g) The La Quinta Entities shall not take any action to exempt any person, other than Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo, from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL, Article NINTH of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Article NINTH of the Properties Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(i). 

   

 7.6 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time, the Company Surviving Corporation, the Properties Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the 

    ##### 

  

    

full extent permitted by applicable Law, each present or former director or
officer of the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as a director or officer of the La Quinta Entities
or La Quinta Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
any transactions contemplated hereby. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes
involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter occurring prior to
or at the Effective Time, (A) the Company Surviving Corporation,
Properties Surviving Corporation and Parent shall promptly pay reasonable
legal fees and expenses as incurred in advance of the final disposition of
any Legal Action to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by
Law and (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to
them, and Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties
Surviving Corporation, shall pay such reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days after statements
therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company
Surviving Corporation, the Properties Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ _further_ , that none
of the Company Surviving Corporation, Properties Surviving Corporation or
Parent shall be obligated under this Section 7.6(a) to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable
Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with
respect to any single Legal Action except to the extent that two or more of
such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of
such action; and _provided_ _further_ , that the Company Surviving
Corporation, the Properties Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have
no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party unless, in connection with
such Legal Action, Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation and Properties
Surviving Corporation, if and to the extent required by the DGCL, receive, as
applicable, an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay
such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such Legal Action shall notify in
writing the Company Surviving Corporation, the Properties Surviving
Corporation and Parent thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations under this Section 7.6(a) of the La Quinta
Entities, the Company Surviving Corporation, the Properties Surviving
Corporation and Parent except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices such party. 

   

 (b) Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present and former director and officer of the La Quinta Entities and the La Quinta Subsidiaries provided for in the respective charters or bylaws in effect as of the date hereof shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Legal Actions asserted or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Legal Action. From and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the La Quinta Entities and the La Quinta Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any written indemnification agreement and in any indemnification provisions included in any employment agreements between the Company, Properties and/or one or more La Quinta Subsidiaries and any such officer and director. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the La Quinta Entities shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the La Quinta Entities existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the La Quinta Entities directors and officers in a form acceptable to the La Quinta Entities which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the La Quinta Entities; _provided_ that the premium payable for such insurance shall not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). The La Quinta Entities agree to consult with Parent in connection with purchasing such coverage. The La Quinta Entities represent that such annual premium amount is set forth in Section 7.6(c) of the La Quinta Entities Disclosure Schedule. If the La Quinta Entities are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, the La Quinta Entities shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (d) It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.6 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 7.6 shall be in addition to, and shall not limit, any rights that current or former directors, officers or employees may have to indemnification or exculpation existing as of the date hereof. 

   

 (e) In the event Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation or the Properties Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation or the Properties Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6. 

   

 7.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the La Quinta Entities shall, and shall cause each of the La Quinta Subsidiaries and each of the La Quinta Entities and La Quinta Subsidiaries Representatives to, afford to Parent and to the Representatives of Parent access upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times without undue interruption to (1) their properties, books, records and Contracts, and (2) the officers, employees and agents of the La Quinta Entities and the La Quinta Subsidiaries; provided, however, that Parent shall obtain the La Quinta Entities consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to accessing any non-executive officer or key employee. The La Quinta Entities shall furnish Parent such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request to the extent such data or information is reasonably available. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its Representatives shall have the right to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections of each of the La Quinta Properties; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor its Representatives shall have the right to take and analyze any samples of any 

    ##### 

  

    

environmental media (including soil, groundwater, surface water, air or
sediment) or any building material to perform any invasive testing procedure
on any building. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo shall hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in that certain confidentiality agreement between Guarantor and the Company dated October 8, 2005 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

   

 7.8 _Public Announcements_. The La Quinta Entities and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the Mergers contemplated hereby no later than the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the Business Day immediately following the time at which this Agreement is signed. 

  

 7.9 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) On and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all severance, change in control and similar obligations of the La Quinta Entities or any La Quinta Subsidiary, and the La Quinta Entities or Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to any applicable officer or employee, any amounts with respect to such severance, change in control and similar obligations that are payable by their terms upon consummation of the Mergers, at the Effective Time or on the Closing Date. 

    

 (b) Parent hereby agrees that, through at least December 31, 2007, it shall, or it shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide each employee of the Company Surviving Corporation, the Properties Surviving Corporation and the La Quinta Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective Time (the "La Quinta Employees") with at least the same level of base salary and cash incentive compensation opportunity that was provided to each such La Quinta Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide the La Quinta Employees with employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation and deferred compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such La Quinta Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations which accrued prior to the Effective Time under any supplemental retirement plan (including any rabbi trust with respect thereto) and the La Quinta Entities 2005 Bonus Plans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the La Quinta Entities are expressly authorized to take the following actions with respect to the La Quinta Entities 2005 Bonus Plans: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) the Compensation Committee of the applicable La Quinta Entity may approve (A) bonuses for La Quinta Employees participating in the La Quinta Entities 2005 Plans (" _Participants_ ") prior to the Closing Date as set forth on a list of such Participants, which list shall include their respective bonuses, as approved by such Compensation Committee, provided that the aggregate "stretch" bonuses, which, for all of such Participants, represents the amount of annual (2005) bonus above the target annual (2005) bonus, to be paid under the plan to such Participants and which in the aggregate will not exceed $3 million; (B) the aggregate bonus pool for those Participants who are general managers and other field level employees; and (C) incentive programs for other La Quinta Employees (who may or may not be Participants), which programs are consistent with the La Quinta Entities ordinary course of business and are set forth on a schedule to the Compensation Committees approval of such programs; _provided_ that, in each of subclauses (A), (B) and (C) the aggregate amount of any such bonus or amount payable under such program is accrued on the La Quinta Entities consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005; and 

   

 (ii) The La Quinta Entities may pay all such bonuses and amounts due under the foregoing, which amount will be payable in the ordinary course of business but in any event by February 17, 2006. 

  

 (c) Following the Effective Time, in the event the bonuses and other payments authorized prior to the Closing Date as described in Section 7.9(b) above have not been paid to the La Quinta Employees, the Company MergerCo and the Properties MergerCo will pay, and Parent will cause them to pay, such bonuses to the La Quinta Employees participating in the La Quinta Entities 2005 Bonus Plans and other payments to the La Quinta Employees participating in such programs, in each case, in the ordinary course of business but in any event by February 17, 2006, provided that any such Participant or other La Quinta Employee was employed as of the Closing Date. The Company MergerCo and the Properties MergerCo will pay, and Parent will cause them to pay, to any Participant or La Quinta Employee whose employment is terminated on or after the Closing Date by their respective employer any amounts under the bonuses and other payment arrangements approved as provided in Section 7.9(b) above (but only to the extent such La Quinta Employee would be entitled to such amounts absent such termination), such payments to be made in connection with their termination. 

   

 (d) On and after the Effective Time, each La Quinta Employee shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Company Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates under which each La Quinta Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the La Quinta Entities or any ERISA Affiliate, as applicable, under corresponding Employee Programs immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such plan, program or arrangement shall credit each such La Quinta Employee for service accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the La Quinta Entities or any ERISA Affiliate, as applicable; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) Without limiting any of the foregoing, Parent agrees that it shall, or shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation to, provide severance benefits to each La Quinta Employee who is terminated during the two-year period immediately following the Effective Time in an amount that is at least equal to the severance benefits that would have been paid to such La Quinta Employee pursuant to the terms of the La Quinta Corporation Change in Control Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be calculated based on each La Quinta Employees compensation and service at the time of such termination of employment. 

   

 (f) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation (" _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which a La Quinta Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a corresponding Employee Program, and (ii) provide credit to each La Quinta Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such La Quinta Employee under the Employee Programs during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time. 

   

 (g) Parent and the La Quinta Entities acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6 hereof, all provisions contained herein with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent and the La Quinta Entities and shall not create any right (i) in any other person (or any beneficiary thereof), including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Employee Program or any other stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, consulting, change-of-control, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and other benefit plan, whether or not subject to ERISA (including any related funding mechanism now in effect or required in the future), whether formal or informal, oral or written, legally binding or not under which (A) any past or present director, officer, employee or consultant of any of the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits or (B) either of the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries has any present or future Liabilities or (ii) to continued employment with the Company Surviving Corporation or the Properties Surviving Corporation. 

   

 7.10 _Required Financing_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letter and to satisfy the conditions applicable to it set forth in the Financing Letter that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent will provide the La Quinta Entities any amendments to the Financing Letter as promptly as possible (but in any event within 48 hours) and will give the La Quinta Entities prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Financing Letter or any termination of the Financing Letter. Parent shall keep the La Quinta Entities informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of 

    ##### 

  

    

the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall not permit
any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, the Financing Letter without first
consulting with the La Quinta Entities or, if such amendment would or would
be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay in any
material respect Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, without first obtaining the Companys prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (b) The La Quinta Entities agree to provide, and shall cause the La Quinta Subsidiaries to provide and shall request that the Representatives of the La Quinta Entities and La Quinta Subsidiaries provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company, Properties and the La Quinta Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the La Quinta Entities as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to complete the Mergers and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt raised by Parent to complete the Mergers, (v) forming new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that none of the La Quinta Entities or any La Quinta Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other Liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the La Quinta Entities, reimburse the La Quinta Entities for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the La Quinta Entities, the La Quinta Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the La Quinta Entities or the La Quinta Subsidiaries which is provided by the La Quinta Entities). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b) of this Agreement, as it applies to the La Quinta Entities obligations under this Section 7.10(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the La Quinta Entities willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section 7.10(b). 

   

 (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the La Quinta Entities obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. The La Quinta Entities and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company Surviving Corporation and the Properties Surviving Corporation agrees to assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer, 

    ##### 

 

   

stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and
any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other
similar fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Mergers. 

   

 7.12 _Resignations_. The La Quinta Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company, Properties or any La Quinta Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company in writing at least 5 Business Days prior to the Closing. 

  

 7.13 _Redemption of Series A Preferred Stock_. If not previously redeemed, provided that all of the conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the La Quinta Entities shall take all necessary actions to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the redemption price per share calculated in accordance with Section I(f) of the Certificate of the Powers, Designations, Preferences and Rights of the 9% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Certificate of Designations_") consisting as part of the Properties Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Series A Redemption Price_"), including depositing the aggregate Series A Redemption Price in trust in accordance with the terms of Sections I(g)(iii) and I(g)(v) of the Series A Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in connection with such redemption, Properties may issue and sell to the Company or any La Quinta Subsidiary shares of capital stock in an amount necessary to fund the aggregate Series A Redemption Price. 

  

 7.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the La Quinta Entities and their respective boards of directors shall (a) take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute.

 10.4 _Interpretation_. The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. All references in this Agreement to Articles, Sections and Exhibits shall refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the context shall require otherwise. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall not be limiting and shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." 

  

 10.5 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_  Except for any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time, none of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, and thereafter there shall be no Liability on the part of either Parent, Company MergerCo, Properties MergerCo, the Company or Properties or any of their respective officers, directors or stockholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any party hereto, express or implied. 

  

 10.6 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement (a) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the La Quinta Entities Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except that Section 7.6 is
intended to be for the benefit of those persons described therein and the
covenants contained therein may be enforced by such persons and (c) may be
executed in two or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single
agreement. 

   

 10.7 _Remedies_. The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the La Quinta Entities in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the La Quinta Entities and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge that the La Quinta Entities shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the La Quinta Entities sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in the following sentence and the Guarantee; _provided_ , _however_ , the La Quinta Entities shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent, Company MergerCo or Properties MergerCo of Sections 7.7(b) and 7.10(c). Without limiting the right to receive any payment it may be entitled to receive under Sections 1.6 or 7.10(b), the La Quinta Entities agree that to the extent they have incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate Liability of Parent, Company MergerCo, Property MergerCo and Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Guarantee, and in no event shall the La Quinta Entities seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from Parent, Company MergerCo, Property MergerCo or Guarantor or their respective Representatives and affiliates in connection therewith. 

  

 10.8 _Assignment_ Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform its obligations. 

  

 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. 

  

 10.10 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Properties, Parent, Company MergerCo and Properties MergerCo hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to
plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein
has been brought in any inconvenient forum. The parties to this Agreement
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
litigation in the manner provided in Section 10.1 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by applicable Laws, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof. 

   

 10.11 _Gender Neutral_. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 

  

 10.12 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Company Board and the Properties Board have approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and any applicable provision of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Properties Certificate of Incorporation, the terms of this Agreement, and (b) this Agreement is executed by the parties hereto. 

  

 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Legal Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (a) no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a Legal Action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.13.
