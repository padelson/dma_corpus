prepared in good faith and in accordance with the Accounting Principles set
forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_, and a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail Sellers calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital based upon
the draft Estimated Balance Sheet. To the extent the Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, then the portion of the
Purchase Price paid by Buyer to Seller at Closing pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)(iv)_ shall be increased by the amount of such excess. To the extent the
Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital,
then the portion of the Purchase Price paid by Buyer to Seller at Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ shall be reduced by the amount of such
shortfall.

 



 

(b) Within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a draft Final Balance Sheet, which shall be

forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ , and a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers calculation of the Final Net
Working Capital based upon the draft Final Balance Sheet.

 



 

(c) Following its receipt from Buyer of the draft Final Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, Seller shall have thirty (30) days to review the draft
Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (and Seller shall have the right
to (i) examine all accounting records, including work papers and financial
records used or generated in connection with the preparation of the draft
Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and such other documents as
Seller may reasonably request in connection with its review of the draft Final
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and (ii) have access to all Facilities
and all employees and agents of Buyer, the Companies and the AEC Subsidiary as
Seller may reasonably request in connection with its review of the draft Final
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement) and to inform Buyer in writing of any
disagreement that it may have with the draft Final Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, which objection shall, to the extent practicable, specify
in reasonable detail Sellers disagreement with the draft Final Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement (the " _Objection_ "). If Buyer does not receive the
Objection within such thirty (30) day period, the draft Final Balance Sheet
and the amount of the Final Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and shall become
binding upon Seller, and the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital on
the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Statement shall be the Final Net Working Capital. If Seller timely
delivers an Objection to Buyer, Buyer shall then have ten (10) Business Days
from the date of receipt of such Objection (the " _Review Period_ ") to review
and respond to the Objection in writing (and Buyer shall have the right to
examine the work papers and financial records used or generated in connection
with the preparation of the Objection and such other documents as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with its review of the Objection); _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyers response to any Objection shall be limited to those
specific disagreements listed in the Objection. If Seller does not receive a
written response from Buyer within such ten (10) Business Day period, the
draft Final Balance Sheet and the amount of the Final Net Working Capital set
forth in the Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer and
shall become binding upon Buyer, and the calculation of the Final Net Working
Capital contained in the Objection shall be the Final Net Working Capital. If
Buyer does timely deliver a written response within such ten (10) Business Day
period, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the Final Balance Sheet and the determination of
the Final Net Working Capital. If they are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the Final Balance Sheet and/or the determination
of the Final Net Working Capital within twenty (20) days following the
expiration of Buyers Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly refer the
dispute to a certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to both
Seller and Buyer (the " _CPA Firm_ "), which shall resolve such disagreements.
In the event that Buyer and Seller cannot mutually agree on a certified public
accounting firm within thirty (30) days following the expiration of Buyers
Review Period, each of Buyer and Seller shall select a certified public
accounting firm, and such two certified public accounting firms shall mutually
select a third certified public accounting firm to serve as the CPA Firm
within ten (10) days thereafter. Buyer and Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to
use its reasonable best efforts to render its determination within forty-five
(45) days after the dispute is first submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firms
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and
Seller shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and
records relating to the Closing Statement and all other items reasonably
requested by the CPA Firm. Nothing in this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall be
construed to authorize or permit the CPA Firm to resolve any differences among
Buyer and Seller other than those unresolved disagreements listed in the
Objection, and the CPA Firm shall not be authorized or permitted to do so. In
resolving any disagreements, the CPA Firm shall be bound by the provisions of
this _Section 2.3_ and may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Seller. The Final
Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital as determined by the CPA Firm
shall be the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital. The
Closing Statement as agreed to (or deemed to be agreed to) by Buyer and Seller
or as determined by the CPA Firm shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing
Statement_."

 



 

(d) To the extent that the Final Net Working Capital on the Final Closing
Statement exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay,
within two (2) Business Days of the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_, to Seller in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller in
writing, the amount of such excess. To the extent that

 



      
 

 



 

the Final Net Working Capital reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Seller shall pay, within two (2)
Business Days of the determination of the Final Net Working Capital as
provided in _Section 2.3(c)_, to Buyer in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Buyer in writing, the
amount of such shortfall.

 



 

(e) If any unresolved objections are submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution
as provided above, the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
relationship the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims that the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Seller, and if the CPA Firm ultimately resolves such claim by awarding to
Buyer $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
CPA Firm will be allocated 70% to Buyer and 30% to Seller.

 



 

(f) Any payments due under this _Section 2.3_ shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of actual payment at a rate equal to the "prime rate"
adjusted on a daily basis as published from time to time in _The Wall Street
Journal_.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any provision set forth in this _Section 2.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, there is no general agreement
among the parties to submit disputes under this Agreement to arbitration. For
the avoidance of doubt, all matters contemplated by the draft Final Balance
Sheet, the draft Closing Statement, Buyers calculation of the Final Net
Working Capital, any Objection thereto, Buyers response to any such
Objection, the determination of the Final Balance Sheet, Final Net Working
Capital, the Final Closing Statement and any matters reasonably related
thereto or which are reflected in the Financial Statements that are resolved
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be deemed to be fully and finally
settled and resolved and shall not be subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Article VIII_ hereof, provided, however that if such matters did, or would
have been deemed to, result from a breach by Buyer, Seller or the Companies of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto reserves their rights under this
Agreement, on behalf of itself, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, to seek indemnification for such claims for Losses with
respect to any such otherwise resolved claim.

 



 

2.4. _Hydrotreater Adjustment_. On the third Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an updated _Schedule 10.25(a)_ , which
shall be prepared in good faith, setting forth an updated construction budget
and construction/start-up schedule for the Birmingham Hydrotreater and
reflecting any remaining actions, testing or notifications required for the
completion of the Birmingham Hydrotreater under applicable Governmental
Authorizations or Laws (the " _Updated HT Budget_ "). To the extent the
estimated costs to complete the Birmingham Hydrotreater reflected in the
Updated HT Budget exceed the amount set forth on _Schedule 10.25(a)_ as of
the date of this Agreement, then the portion of the Purchase Price paid by
Buyer to Seller at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ shall be reduced
by the amount of such excess. To the extent the estimated costs to complete
the Birmingham Hydrotreater reflected in the Updated HT Budget are less than
the amount set forth on _Schedule 10.25(a)_ as of the date of this Agreement,
then the portion of the Purchase Price paid by Buyer to

 



       
 

 



 

Seller at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ shall be increased by the
amount of such difference.

in payments are required to be made.

 



 

3.25. _Governmental Authorizations_. The Companies and the AEC Subsidiary have

such pre-closing notification, supplement or amendment shall be effective to

apportioned as follows: (i) in the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes based upon or related
to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or
payroll Taxes) Sellers liability shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains
or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or payroll Taxes,
Sellers liability shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. If Buyer or Seller will pay
any Taxes apportioned to the other Party, Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
shall present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which it is entitled under this _Section 5.7(c)_ together
with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
proration amount. In the event that Buyer or Seller is entitled to
reimbursement under this _Section 5.7(c)_, the applicable Party shall make
such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten (10) days after the
presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which
the presenting Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that Buyer, the
Companies or the AEC Subsidiary receives any Tax refund or Tax credit relating
to or attributable to the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary or any of the assets
of the Companies or the AEC Subsidiary that is related to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Buyer shall immediately pay such amount to Seller unless included in
the Final Net Working Capital.

 



 

(e) In the case of assessments or subsequent audits of Taxes with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall control such assessments or subsequent
audits and

 



      
 

 



 

shall notify Buyer in writing and keep Buyer apprised of the status of same.
Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall settle any dispute with a
Governmental Authority if such settlement would have a material and adverse
impact on any of the Buyer, the Companies or the AEC Subsidiaries without
obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

5.8. _Transition Services_. Following the Closing, either party hereto (the "
_Requesting Party_ ") may request that any other party hereto (the " _Service

set forth in such Environmental Insurance Policy, Buyer, on behalf of itself
and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, agrees first to (a) timely tender
such claim for Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities for coverage under any
such Environmental Insurance Policy to the insurer that issued such coverage
(the " _Environmental Insurer_ "), and (b) to exercise commercially reasonable
diligence, and utilize commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain coverage for
such Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities in compliance with the terms and
conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy. Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer on a commercially reasonable basis, to the extent requested by Buyer,
with respect to any such claim for insurance coverage, and Seller shall
independently have the right, at its sole discretion, to seek coverage under
such Environmental Insurance Policy for Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
with respect to costs incurred by Seller or otherwise. Buyer and Seller agree
that any such Environmental Insurance Policy shall provide first recourse
coverage with respect to any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, subject to
any applicable policy retentions or deductibles, and that any Seller
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall to be
excess of any coverage provided by

 



      
 

 



 

such Environmental Insurance Policy or any other insurance or indemnification
applicable to such Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities. If and to the extent
the Environmental Insurer (i) denies a claim for coverage tendered by Buyer,
notwithstanding Buyers commercially reasonable diligence and efforts in
pursuing coverage for such claim, or (ii) does not acknowledge its obligation
to provide coverage for such claim within 120 days after its receipt of
notification of such claim (collectively, an " _Unresolved Insurance Claim_
"), Buyer may proceed to assert a claim for indemnity under _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities in excess
of any applicable retentions or deductibles in the Environmental Insurance
Policy. To the extent Buyer submits such a claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ after such denial or delay, Buyer, upon receipt of
payment of the claim, at Sellers request, shall assign to Seller such
applicable Unresolved Insurance Claim with respect to Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, and
otherwise shall assist and cooperate with any Seller efforts to recover under
any Environmental Insurance Policy with respect to such Unresolved Insurance
Claim. In the event that, Buyer receives any proceeds from an Unresolved
Insurance Claim with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities for
which it has received payment from Seller for a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, Buyer, upon receipt of such insurance
proceeds, shall promptly transfer the amount of such insurance proceeds to
Seller in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by Seller in writing.

 



 

(e) Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ unless and until the amount of all Losses for which
indemnification is sought by the Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder first
exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event all amounts sought
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in excess of the Deductible shall be subject
to indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers aggregate
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Sections
8.1(a)(i) and (iii)_ shall not exceed $12,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Losses for
breaches or inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations shall not be
subject to the Deductible or the Cap, but in no event shall exceed the
Purchase Price. Losses under _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ shall not be subject to
the Deductible but shall be subject to the Cap. The aggregate amount of
insurance proceeds received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under any
Environmental Insurance Policy pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ shall also be
credited towards satisfaction of the Cap and shall also be credited towards
the Escrow Account to the extent set forth in _Section 8.4(b)_. Once Buyer
has received indemnity proceeds from any combination of the Escrow Account or
Seller that equals the Cap, Seller shall have no further liability to Buyer
pursuant to _Sections 8.1(a)(i) and (iii)_, except with respect to the
Fundamental Representations, the Buyer Indemnified Parties agree to surrender
to Seller any and all of their right, title and interest in and to the
Environmental Insurance Policy and execute such documentation as may be
required by Seller or the insurer thereunder to effectuate such surrender. The
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any of Sellers indemnification
obligations under _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_, but in no event shall Sellers
aggregate obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_ exceed the Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, none of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be deemed to have waived all claims and rights to, indemnification
hereunder for any Losses to the extent that reserves or accruals have been
established or reflected on the Final Balance Sheet for the Losses for which
indemnification is sought. All Losses claimed by a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (whether or not resolved through the
provisions hereof) shall not be the subject of any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ and, by making a claim for indemnification under this _Article
VIII_, Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties,
shall be deemed to have waived any rights it or they may have under _Section
2.3_ with respect to any such Losses.

 



 

(g) For purposes of determining whether the thresholds in this _Section 8.1_
have been surpassed and/or determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Section 8.1_, all "material," "Material Adverse
Effect," "material and adverse" or similar materiality type qualifications
contained in any representations and warranties shall be disregarded;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such qualifications contained in _Section
3.10_ shall not be disregarded for such purposes and (ii) when such
qualifications are used in a definitional manner (e.g., Material Contract),
such qualifications shall not be disregarded.

 



 

8.2. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the limitations in _Sections 8.2_
and _8.6_ , Buyer, hereby indemnifies and holds Seller and its officers,
directors, managers, Affiliates, shareholders, members, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against
any and all Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties may suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of or in connection with:

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties made
by Buyer in this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) any failure by any of Buyer, the Companies or the AEC Subsidiary or the
Buyer Parent Guarantor to carry out, perform, satisfy and discharge any of
their respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement that are
required to be performed following the Closing.

 



 

(b) All representations and warranties of Buyer in this Agreement shall
survive until the Indemnification Termination Date. All covenants and
agreements of Buyer and the Companies in this Agreement that are required to
be performed (i) prior to the Closing, shall terminate on the Closing, and
(ii) after the Closing, shall survive in accordance with their terms. The
Seller Indemnified Parties shall have the right to be indemnified and held
harmless under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ in respect of the representations and
warranties of Buyer only if such right is asserted in writing on or before the
Indemnification Termination Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Seller Indemnified Parties may only assert a claim for indemnification
against Buyer for any matter not involving a third party by giving written
notice to Buyer specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim.

 



 

(d) All Losses claimed by a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ (whether or not resolved through the provisions hereof) shall not be the
subject of any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof and, by making a
claim for indemnification under this _Article VIII_, Seller, on behalf of
itself and the other Seller Indemnified Parties, shall be deemed to have
waived any rights it or they may have under _Section 2.3_ with respect to any
such Losses.

 



 

8.3. _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any third party shall notify any party entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect
to any matter involving a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that is
reasonably expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification against the
other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ ,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of such claim
is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume (which such
assumption shall not be deemed an admission that such Third Party Claim is
valid or that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim) and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying
Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for
or results in any payment by the Indemnified Party of, or obligation of the
Indemnified Party for, any damages or other amount, any Lien on any property
of the Indemnified Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the
part of the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction
upon the conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) Unless the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim
as provided in _Section 8.3(b)_ within fifteen (15) days after the
Indemnifying Party received notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may
deem appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the

 



      
 

 



 

prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

8.4. _Post-Closing General Escrow_.

 



 

(a) The General Escrow Amount will be utilized solely to satisfy any
indemnification obligations of Seller to Buyer under _Section 8.1_ and to
cover other amounts that can expressly be paid out of the General Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agreement
shall terminate upon the General Escrow Termination Date, subject to
continuation for disputed claims under _Sections 8.1(d)_ and _10.25(d)_ (the
" _Escrow Term_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the General Escrow
Amount may be drawn upon by Buyer, its successors or assigns solely for the
purpose of satisfying any indemnification obligations of Seller under _Section
8.1_.

 



 

(b) If Buyer asserts a claim against the General Escrow Amount under this
_Article VIII_ and Seller does not dispute such claim, Buyer shall be
entitled to indemnification by Seller in accordance with this _Article VIII_,
including the right to receive from the General Escrow Amount funds in an
amount equal to the amount of Losses for which Buyer is entitled for such
claim under this _Article VIII_. If, however, Seller disputes such claim,
Buyer shall receive the undisputed portion thereof, if any, but shall not be
entitled to receive any such disputed portion thereof from the General Escrow
Amount with respect to such claim prior to resolution of such Dispute and, if
such Dispute extends beyond the expiration of the General Escrow Term, the
term of the General Escrow Term will be automatically extended as provided in
_Section 8.4(c)_. If Buyer is paid any amount under the Environmental
Insurance Policy for a claim for Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, and
such claim is paid under the Environmental Insurance Policy less applicable
deductions and retentions, Buyer shall be entitled to receive from the General
Escrow Amount funds in an amount equal to any such applicable policy
retentions or deductibles. To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
receive, in the aggregate, any insurance proceeds from the Environmental
Insurance Policy pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ in excess of $5,000,000 ("
_Qualified Insurance Proceeds_ "), then an amount equal to such Qualified
Insurance Proceeds will be released to Seller from the General Escrow Amount
on the first Business Day immediately following the receipt of such proceeds
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(c) If the indemnification obligations of Seller for claims of indemnification
under this _Article VIII_ of which Seller has been notified prior to the
expiration of the General Escrow Term have been satisfied and no Dispute then
exists as to any claim for indemnification by Buyer for such claims, the
balance of the General Escrow Amount plus the earned interest and other income
will be released to Seller on the first Business Day immediately following the
expiration of the General Escrow Term. To the extent there does exist a claim
for indemnification by Buyer of which Seller has been notified, which claim
has not been satisfied in full in accordance herewith prior to the expiration
of the General Escrow Term, an amount equal to the reasonable estimate of the
amount of such claim hereunder by Seller will be withheld from the balance of
the General Escrow Amount and will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of the

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Agreement until such claim has been fully resolved and the General
Escrow Term shall be deemed to be extended accordingly and the balance of the
General Escrow Amount plus the earned interest and other income will be
released to Seller.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver such instruction notices and
letters in writing to the Escrow Agent, and take such other actions, as may be
reasonably requested, to implement the terms hereof and to disburse the
General Escrow Amount as contemplated herein.

 



 

8.5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges that, following the
Closing, (a) except for any claim for intentional fraud and other than as
provided in Section 10.25 with respect to Losses incurred by Buyer as a
consequence of a Hydrotreater Completion Defect, the indemnities provided for
in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Indemnified Party against any Indemnifying Party by contract, statute or
otherwise, at law or equity (including without limitation any claim arising
under applicable Environmental Law), for any claim, cause of action or other
matter arising from any breach by Buyer, the Companies or Seller, as
applicable, of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements under this Agreement or related to the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights,
claims and causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any) known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that it may have against each Indemnifying Party, as applicable, for the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement under this
Agreement or related to the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, the payment of money, as
limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Companies
or Seller contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except
in the case of intentional fraud, Buyer hereby waives any right to rescind
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.6. _Indemnity Amounts to be Computed Net of Insurance Proceeds_.
Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein to the contrary, and
subject to the Deductible and Cap provisions of _Section 8.1(e)_, the amount
of any indemnification payable under any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be net of any insurance proceeds actually realized by and paid to the
Indemnified Party by reason of the facts and circumstances giving rise to such
indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly make and diligently pursue insurance claims relating to
any facts and circumstances giving rise to such indemnification. Additionally,
and only with respect to indemnification claims for Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_, Buyer Indemnified Parties
agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain recovery in
respect of any claims from any third party (whether through indemnity,
contribution, any Environmental Insurance Policy or other insurance, or
otherwise) which may be available to such Party in respect of such claims and
further agree to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any losses
in respect of which a claim can be made. Buyer Indemnified Parties also shall
take all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any increase, expansion
or exacerbation of any Environmental Liabilities. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ to the extent that any act or omission of any Buyer
Indemnified Party increases, expands or exacerbates any such Environmental
Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Buyer Indemnified
Parties may seek indemnification for any Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
discovered in the ordinary course of post-closing Business Operations, subject
to the obligations of such Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.1(d)_.
Additionally, subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.6_,
environmental sampling or testing conducted by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
after the Closing Date shall **_not_** constitute an exacerbation of such
Environmental Liabilities if such sampling or testing is undertaken in
accordance with the terms of any applicable Environmental Insurance Policy and
is also undertaken (i) to respond to, investigate, or otherwise respond to
material facts indicating the potential existence of Environmental Conditions
that, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer Indemnified Parties, may pose a
significant risk to human health or the environment provided that, absent
exigent circumstances requiring immediate action, Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall reasonably consult with Seller and reasonably consider such input as
Seller may provide prior to conducting such sampling or testing; (ii) to
comply with the requirements of any Environmental Law; (iii) in response to an
inquiry, request, claim or demand by a Governmental Authority; (iv) as
reasonably necessary in connection with future construction and development of
the Real Properties as the Buyer Indemnified Parties may commence in their
sole and absolute discretion; or (v) as reasonably necessary to defend or
resolve a Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.6_
to the contrary, Buyer shall not be under any obligation to undertake (or not
undertake) any environmental sampling or testing under any applicable
Environmental Insurance Policy if such environmental sampling or testing (or
forbearance from undertaking such sampling or testing) would cause Buyer to
violate applicable Law.

 



 

8.7. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. All amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement
by one party to another party (other than interest payments) shall be treated
by such parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent
permitted by Law.

(d) by Seller upon written notice to Buyer, if a breach of any of the

satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) Seller has in good faith
indicated in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) Buyer fails to close
the transactions contemplated herein prior to the earlier to occur of five (5)

_Section 2.1_ and two (2) Business Days after the End Date.

 



 

9.2. _Rights on Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, all further
obligations of the parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate
without further liability of any party to the other; _provided_ , that this
_Section 9.2_ and the provisions of _Sections 5.6_ , _10.2_ , _10.5_ , _10.8_
, _10.9_ , _10.10_ , _10.11_ , _10.13_ , _10.15_ , _10.16_ , _10.17_ , _10.18_
, _10.19, 10.20_ , _10.21_ , _10.22_ , _10.23_ and _10.24_ of this Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing contained in this _Section 9.2_ shall relieve (i) any party from
liability for any intentional breach of a material provision of this Agreement
or (ii) Buyer from liability for any breach of _Section 4.8_.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_,
or pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, then Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days of receipt by Buyer of written notice from
Seller) pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds an
amount equal to $3,280,000.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_,
then Seller shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days of
receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer) pay to Seller by wire transfer

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer or Seller fails to promptly pay any amounts
due pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or (c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Seller or Buyer commences a suit or brings an action that results in a
judgment against the other party or any of its Affiliates for any amounts set
forth in, as applicable _Section 9.2(b)_ or _(c)_ or any portion thereof,
the breaching party shall pay to the other, (i) their reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit
or action and (ii) interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment,
at the prime rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was originally required to be made pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_ or _(c)_ plus three percent (3%), with such interest being payable in
respect of the period from the date that payment was originally required to be
made pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ or _(c)_ through the date of payment.

 



 

(e) It is understood and agreed that the amounts contemplated in _Section 9.2
(b)_, _(c_ ) and _(d)_ shall constitute liquidated damages for the
termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set forth therein, as the
actual damages of Seller and Buyer would be difficult or impossible to prove.
In the event that such amounts become payable and are paid, the right to
receive such amounts shall constitute each of Buyers, Sellers and the
Companies and each of their respective Affiliates and representatives sole
and exclusive remedy in connection with termination of this Agreement under
all applicable Law. In the event of a breach of this Agreement beyond any
applicable cure or grace period, the nonbreaching party may simultaneously
pursue any rights of specific performance available to it under _Section
10.20_ or other applicable Law and payment of the amounts set forth in
_Sections 9.2(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ , as applicable; _provided_ that under no
circumstance shall the nonbreaching party be permitted or entitled to receive
both (i) a grant of specific performance under _Section 10.20_ or other
applicable Law to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated, and (ii) payment of any of the fees and expenses set forth in
_Sections 9.2(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_.

 



 

ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

10.1. _Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties_. Buyer acknowledges that
(a) it has had, and pursuant to this Agreement shall have before Closing,
access to the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary and their respective assets and
the officers or other representatives of the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary and
Seller and (b) in making the decision to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely on
the basis of its own independent investigation, including environmental and
other inspections, and upon the express representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and Seller and the Companies
expressly disclaim all liability and responsibility for any representation,
warranty, statement or communication made or communicated (orally or in
writing) to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants or
representatives other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any opinion, information, projection or advice
that may have been provided to Buyer by any officer, director, employee,
agent, consultant, representative or advisor of the

 



       
 

 



 

Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates).
Toward this end, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the
Companies nor Seller or Sellers Affiliates shall have liability to Buyer, any
Buyer Indemnified Party (including following the Closing, the Companies and
the AEC Subsidiary) or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Buyer, or Buyers use of, any such information relating to the Companies and
the AEC Subsidiary, or prepared by or on behalf of the Companies and the AEC
Subsidiary, and supplied to Buyer before or after the date of this Agreement,
or any information, documents or materials made available to Buyer in any data
rooms, any presentations or any other form relating to the business of the
Companies and the AEC Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, neither the Companies nor Seller nor either of
their respective Affiliates has made, and THE COMPANIES, SELLER AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES MAKE NO AND DISCLAIM ANY, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WHETHER BY COMMON LAW, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE,
REGARDING (i) TITLE TO ANY ASSETS OR LAND USE RIGHTS, (ii) THE QUALITY,
CONDITION, OR OPERABILITY OF ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT OR
FIXTURES, INCLUDING FREEDOM FROM LATENT OR PATENT VICES OR DEFECTS, THEIR
MERCHANTABILITY, THEIR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THEIR CONFORMITY
TO MODELS, SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURER DESIGN, (iii) THE CONTENTS,

OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS,
REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATED THERETO, (viii)
ANY RIGHTS OF BUYER UNDER APPROPRIATE STATUTES TO CLAIM DIMINUTION OF
CONSIDERATION OR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, (ix) ANY MATTER OR CIRCUMSTANCE
RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, THE RELEASE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
OR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE
ENVIRONMENT, OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF ANY ASSETS OF T THE
COMPANIES AND THE AEC SUBSIDIARY, AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, ALL ASSETS ARE DELIVERED IN THEIR PRESENT STATUS, CONDITION AND
STATE OF REPAIR, "AS IS, WHERE IS" WITH ALL FAULTS OR DEFECTS (KNOWN OR
UNKNOWN, LATENT, DISCOVERABLE OR UNDISCOVERABLE). THE INCLUSION BY THE
COMPANIES OR SELLER OF ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN

 



      
 

 



 

ADMISSION OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, OF FAULT, RESPONSIBILITY
OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND BY THE COMPANIES, THE AEC SUBSIDIARY OR SELLER UNDER
ANY LAW. Buyer agrees that, to the extent required by Law to be effective, the
disclosures contained in this _Section 10.1_ are "conspicuous" for purposes of
any such Laws. Sellers Affiliates and their respective members, partners,
stockholders, managers, directors, officers, agents and employees are third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.1_.

 



 

10.2. _Confidentiality_. Subject to _Section 10.5_ , prior to Closing, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be kept confidential by
Seller, the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, Buyer and their respective
representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may disclose the
transactions to its Affiliates and to its respective current and prospective
lenders and investors who agree to keep such information confidential. In the
event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, Buyer shall, for a period of five (5) years following the
termination of this Agreement, hold any information obtained by it from
Seller, the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary or their Affiliates and their
representatives in strict confidence and shall not use any of such information
for any purpose, unless such information (a) is or becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Buyer or its officers,
employees or agents, (b) was available to Buyer or its officers, employees or
agents on a non-confidential basis (as evidenced in written records) prior to
its disclosure to Buyer by or at the request of Seller or the Companies, (c)
becomes available to Buyer on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than Seller or the Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that such source is not
bound by a confidentiality agreement with Seller, the Companies or any
Affiliate thereof or otherwise prohibited from disclosing such information to
Buyer by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, or (d) was
independently developed by Buyer (as evidenced in written records) without
reference to information obtained from Seller, the Companies, any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of their representatives.

 



 

10.3. _Indemnification of Managers, Directors and Officers_. All rights to
indemnification provided in the Companies and the AEC Subsidiarys
organizational documents (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) shall
survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms. Prior to the
Closing, the Companies will purchase, for the benefit of each Person who is
now, has been at any time prior to the Closing Date, or who becomes prior to
the Closing Date a director, manager or officer of either of the Companies or
the AEC Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Officers and Directors_
") a prepaid "tail" policy (the " _Tail Policy_ "), that (a) provides
directors and officers liability insurance to the Indemnified Officers and
Directors on substantially the same terms and conditions as the directors and
officers liability insurance policy currently in place for the benefit of
such Indemnified Officers and Directors, including coverage with respect to
any fees, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, suits, proceedings
or investigations, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Officer or Directors service as
a director, manager or officer of either of the Companies or the AEC
Subsidiary, or services performed by such Indemnified Officer and Director at
the request of the Companies or the AEC Subsidiary, in each case occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Closing Date, (b) has a one-time premium not to exceed 300% of
Sellers current annual premium attributable to the Companies, and (c) covers
a period of time ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date. If Buyer, the Companies or the AEC Subsidiary or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of such entity assumes the obligations
set forth herein. The provisions of this _Section 10.3_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this provision applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 



 

10.4. _Employee Matters_ _._

 



 

(a) No later than twenty (20) days prior to Closing, Seller shall provide
Buyer with a revised Business Employee Data List (including the list of
Business Employees) which is current as of that date. Buyer shall make offers
of employment to a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of the Business Employees
(as selected by Buyer in its sole discretion), commencing on the Closing Date.
No later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller
with a list of those Business Employees who have received and accepted offers
of employment with Buyer commencing on the Closing Date (each such Business
Employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "). The terms and conditions of the salary
(or hourly wage rate, as applicable), other compensation opportunities and/or
benefits included in such offers by Buyer to the Business Employees shall be
the same as those provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that such terms and conditions
of the salary (or hourly wage rate, as applicable), compensation opportunities
and/or benefits included in such offers by Buyer to the Business Employees
shall be of sufficient level so as to not trigger any obligations or liability
for notice pay or otherwise arising under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ "). Seller or its Affiliates shall make all
Business Employees reasonably available for interview by Buyer and its
Affiliates and shall not take any action (and shall cause its Affiliates not
to take any action) to dissuade any Business Employee from accepting any offer
of employment from Buyer or one of its Affiliates. Each offer of employment
shall be in writing and is expressly subject to satisfaction of Buyers
standard on-boarding process and procedures, including, but not limited to,
pre-employment drug testing and background check procedures. Immediately prior
to Closing, Seller shall cause to be terminated the employment of each
Continuing Employee who has received and timely accepted an offer of
employment with Buyer in accordance with this _Section 10.4(a)_ In the event
any Key Employee is not offered employment by Buyer in accordance with this
_Section 10.4(a)_ and does not become a Continuing Employee, Buyer shall pay
to Seller within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date an amount
equal to six (6) months of such Key Employees then-current annual base
salary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not assume any other
obligations under any severance/retention agreement with any Company, AEC
Subsidiary, Seller or Seller Parent Guarantor or under any other EMES Employee
Benefit Plan with respect to the Key Employee(s) or any other Business
Employee.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 10.4(e)_ , with respect to any Business Employee other
than a Continuing Employee whose employment relationship with Seller is
terminated by Seller, Seller shall comply with all applicable Laws in
connection therewith, including the WARN Act.

 



 

(c) With respect to the Continuing Employees:

 



 

(i) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies or the AEC Subsidiary to,
provide the Continuing Employees with severance protections, payments and
benefits on the same terms and conditions as the severance protections,
payments and benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer.

 



 

(ii) Subject to applicable Law, Continuing Employees shall have their service
with Seller recognized by Buyer for vesting and eligibility purposes, except
with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or retiree health plan
(whether such plans be active or frozen), under the health and welfare plans,
vacation plans, severance plans and 401(k) plan maintained and sponsored by
Buyer and its Affiliates for benefit-level purposes, but only to the extent
that (a) such service is properly credited under the applicable Benefit Plan,
(b) such service is properly listed on the Business Employee Data List and (c)
such crediting does not result in duplication of benefits. In addition,
subject to applicable Law, all health and welfare plans of Buyer and its
Affiliates shall (x) waive any waiting periods and pre-existing condition
exclusions with respect to participation by and coverage of the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents and (y) honor any deductible and out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and dependents under
similar EMES Employee Benefit Plans for the plan year in which such
participation begins (provided that Seller provides Buyer with such
information no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date).

 



 

(iii) Subject to applicable Law, Buyer or its Affiliate shall offer Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents the opportunity to participate in the
health and welfare plans offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer or
its Affiliates as of the first day of the calendar month following the
calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall cause its 401(k) plan (" _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_") to accept
direct rollovers of the account balances for the Continuing Employees from
Sellers 401(k) plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") to Buyers 401(k) Plan as
soon as administratively feasible following the Closing Date. With respect to
each Continuing Employee who has an outstanding participant loan from the
Seller 401(k) Plan, such Continuing Employee may elect to roll over his or her
entire account balance, including any participant loans, to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan if (i) the rollover is initiated within thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date, and (ii) Seller provides (or causes to be provided to) Buyer
with the information and documentation reasonably necessary to effect the
rollover of such loans to the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) For each Continuing Employee, Buyer shall assume and honor such Continuing
Employees accrued but unpaid vacation and/or paid time off, in each case as
of the Closing Date (the " _Accrued PTO_ " and the Accrued PTO so assumed by
Buyer, the " _Assumed PTO_ "). Continuing Employees shall be permitted to use
their Assumed PTO in a manner consistent with policies applicable to
similarly-situated employees of Buyer, and to participate in Buyers vacation
plans; _provided_ that the participation shall be on the same terms and
conditions as similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates as of
the Closing Date.

 



 

(vi) The parties agree that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation
or liability with respect to the pro-rata portion of such employees annual
bonus, if any, for the portion of the fiscal year ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(vii) Nothing in this Agreement (other than severance obligations described
herein) shall require Buyer or its Affiliates to continue for any period of
time or upon any particular terms or conditions the employment of any
Continuing Employee.

 



 

(viii) The provisions of this _Section 10.4_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 10.4_ , express or
implied, will confer upon any employee, consultant, manager or other service
provider (or any dependent, successor, legal representative or beneficiary
thereof), any rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of
employment or any other service relationship with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 10.4_ express or
implied, will be: (i) an amendment or deemed amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any employee, (ii) construed to interfere with the right of Buyer
or its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of
any of the Business Employees at any time, with or without cause, or restrict
any such entity in the exercise of their independent business judgment in
modifying any of the terms and conditions of the employment or other service
arrangement of the Business Employees, (iii) give any Business Employee or any
other individual associated therewith or any plan or trustee thereof or any
other third Person any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 10.4_
or (iv) deemed to obligate Buyer or its Affiliates to adopt, enter into,
maintain amend or terminate any employee benefit plan or other compensatory
plan, program or arrangement at any time.

 



 

(d) For the 12 month period following the Closing Date, if Buyer or any of its
Affiliates directly or indirectly (including as an employee, a contractor or
an employee of a contractor or subcontractor) retain the services of any
Business Employee to whom Seller paid severance payments or benefits because
the employment of such Business Employee with Seller was terminated as a
result of such Business Employee not receiving an offer of employment from
Buyer or one of its Affiliates in accordance with Section 10.4 (a), Buyer
shall immediately reimburse Seller the actual amount or value of

 



      
 

 



 

severance pay that Seller paid to such Business Employee (without duplication
of any amounts previously paid pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
10.4(a)_ ).

 



 

(e) Seller shall bear any and all obligations and liability for notice pay or
otherwise arising under the WARN Act prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall
bear any and all obligations and liability for notice pay or otherwise arising
under the WARN Act after the Closing Date and/or resulting with respect to any
Business Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee due to any breach
by Buyer of its obligations under _Section 10.4(a)_.

 



 

10.5. _Public Announcements_. The timing and content of all announcements made
hereafter regarding any aspect of this Agreement to the financial community,
government agencies, employees or the general public shall be mutually agreed
upon in advance by Seller and Buyer in their respective sole discretion;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall prevent any party from complying with
applicable Law or regulations or the rules of any national securities
exchange.

 



 

10.6. _Use of Names_. Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing, neither it
nor any of its Affiliates shall use the names "Insight Equity," "Emerge Energy
Services" or any confusingly similar names.

 



 

10.7. _Counsel_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that Seller,
the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, and their respective Affiliates have
retained Latham and Watkins LLP and in-house counsel with Insight Equity
Management Company LLC (collectively, the " _Existing Counsel_ ") to act as
their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
the Existing Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that no other party
to this Agreement or Person has the status of a client of the Existing Counsel
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer
hereby acknowledges and the Companies affirms its pre-existing agreement that,
in the event that a Dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or any of
their Affiliates) and Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Existing Counsel
may represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in such Disputes even though the
interests of Seller or its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the
Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or any of their Affiliates, and even though the
Existing Counsel may have acquired confidential information from or about the
Companies or the AEC Subsidiary related to any Disputes, represented the
Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or one or more of their Affiliates in a matter
substantially related to such Disputes, or may be handling ongoing matters for
Seller, the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or one or more of their Affiliates.
Buyer and the Companies hereby consent to and waive, on behalf of themselves
and each of their Subsidiaries and Affiliates, any conflict of interest in
connection with representation by Existing Counsel in connection with any
Disputes. Moreover, Buyer and the Companies each agree and covenant (for
itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) not to seek to
disqualify the Existing Counsel from Disputes. This is in addition to any
consent or waiver provided prior to Closing to the Existing Counsel by the
Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or their Affiliates. Buyer further agrees and
each Company (for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates)
affirms its pre-existing agreement that Seller owns all rights to assert or
waive privilege associated with the Existing Counsels pre-Closing
representation of the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, and their

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates, to the extent that such representations relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other representation
conducted by the Existing Counsel jointly with Seller or its Affiliates. The
right to assert or waive privilege shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer,
the Companies, the AEC Subsidiary, or their Affiliates. Each Company (for
itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) affirms its pre-
existing agreement not to disclose and to protect from disclosure to any other
Person, including Buyer, and will strictly preserve the confidentiality of,
all communications and materials exchanged among the Companies, Existing
Counsel, Seller and Sellers Affiliates that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other representation
conducted by the Existing Counsel jointly with Seller or its Affiliates in
order to preserve all privileges and confidentiality with respect to all such
communications and materials. Buyer and the Companies each agree to take, and
to cause their Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the intent
of this _Section 10.7_ and not to take or cause their Affiliates to take
positions contrary to the intent of this _Section 10.7_. Seller, Buyer and
each Company further agrees that the Existing Counsel and their partners and
employees are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.7_.

 



 

10.8. _Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement and the Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated as of January 25, 2016, by and between Seller
Parent Guarantor and Buyer Parent Guarantor, and the documents referred to
herein and to be delivered pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions of the parties, whether oral or written,
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of
any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided in
writing.

 



 

10.9. _Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 9.2(d)_ and _Section
10.20(c)_ each of the parties hereto shall pay the fees and expenses of their

of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

10.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted
according to the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the choice of
Law and conflicts of Law rules thereof.

INVOLVING ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A
FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS, AND EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO (i) UNCONDITIONALLY ACCEPTS THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS AND ANY RELATED APPELLATE COURT AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY
ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY AND (ii) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION SUCH
PARTY MAY NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER HAS AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR

party). The parties hereto shall execute any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

10.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement and each partys respective rights and
obligations hereunder may not be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise,

so shall be null and void, provided that Buyer may assign its right to
purchase the Interests from Seller to one of its Affiliates without Sellers
consent; provided further that (i) Buyer will give prompt written notice to
Seller of such assignment and (ii) no such assignment will relieve Buyer or
Buyer Parent Guarantor of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement

and their successors and permitted assigns.

this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part hereof.

 



 

10.17. _Severability_. If any provision, clause or part of this Agreement, or
the application thereof under certain circumstances, is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Agreement, or the application of such provision, clause or part under other

and effect. Any such invalid provision shall be modified to give it maximum
effect consistent with the intent of the stricken provision so as to allow its
enforceability under applicable Law.

 



 

10.18. _No Third Party Rights_. Except as provided in _Article VIII_ and
_Sections 10.1_ , _10.3_ , _10.7_ and _10.19_ , (a) nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under, or by reason of,
this Agreement, (b) no third party is entitled to rely on any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and (c) none of Buyer, the Companies or Seller assumes any
liability to any third party because of any reliance on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of Buyer, the Companies or Seller
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

10.19. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that no recourse
under this Agreement or any

 



      
 

 



 

documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be
had against any current or future director, manager, officer, employee,
general or limited partner, member, shareholder or agent of Seller or any
Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no Personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by any current or future director, manager,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, shareholder or agent of
Seller or any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, for any obligation of
Seller under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Sellers Affiliates and their
respective managers, directors, officers, agents and employees are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.19_.

 



 

10.20. _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that (i) irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including the
failure of a party hereto to take such actions as are required of it hereunder
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damage, (iii) the provisions in _Section 9.2_ shall not diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any partys right to specific performance as set forth
in this _Section 10.20_ and (iv) the right of specific performance as set
forth in this _Section 10.20_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the parties hereto would
have entered into this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including the failure of a party hereto to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

 



 

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree
that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of
_Section 5.3_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
sought in accordance with this _Section 10.20_ on the basis that (A) the party
seeking such remedy has an adequate remedy at law or (B) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
parties shall be permitted and entitled to seek both a grant of specific
performance and payment of any of the fees and expenses set forth in _Sections
9.2(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ , as applicable; _provided_ that under no
circumstance shall the parties be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a
grant of specific performance to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to
be consummated and (ii) payment of any of the fees and expenses set forth in
_Sections 9.2(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) If Buyer, Seller or the Companies bring an action or seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and/or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the failure
by Seller or Buyer to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that results in a
judgment against Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, Buyer
shall pay to Seller or the Companies, or Seller shall pay to Buyer, their
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such action or suit.

 



 

10.21. _Construction_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.22. _Schedules_. Seller may, at its option, include in the Schedules items
that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such
inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in the Schedules shall
constitute a disclosure for all purposes under this Agreement notwithstanding
any reference to a specific Section, and all such information shall be deemed
to qualify the entire Agreement and not just such Section if the relevance of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent from such disclosure.

 



 

10.23. _Buyer Parent Guaranty of Obligations_. Buyer Parent Guarantor hereby
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the prompt
and complete payment and performance when and as due of all obligations,
including payment and covenant obligations, of Buyer under this Agreement and
any other agreements entered into in connection herewith. In furtherance of

10.25. _Construction Completion of Birmingham Hydrotreater_.

 



 

(a) Buyer hereby agrees, following the Closing Date, to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to pursue the completion of the Birmingham
Hydrotreater in accordance with the Birmingham Hydrotreater Construction Plans
and Schedule (subject to any requirements in any applicable Governmental
Authorization or Environmental Laws for the construction and start-up of the
Birmingham Hydrotreater and the Business Operations that may require a
deviation from or are in addition to the Birmingham Hydrotreater Construction
Plans and Schedule) and obtain a determination by an Independent Inspector
that the Birmingham Hydrotreater is capable of producing product conforming to
the specifications set forth in the Birmingham Hydrotreater Construction Plans
and Schedules and in conformance with any applicable Governmental
Authorizations and Laws. Subsequent to Closing, to the extent (i) Buyer
reasonably determines in good faith that the Birmingham Hydrotreater will
require capital expenditures in excess of the amounts set forth in the Updated
HT Budget in order to conform, in all material respects, with the engineering
specifications included in the Birmingham Hydrotreater Construction Plans and
Schedule or comply, in all material respects, with applicable Governmental
Authorizations and Laws or (ii) the Birmingham Hydrotreater is not constructed
or installed on time in accordance with the Birmingham Hydrotreater
Construction Plans and Schedule as a direct consequence of any action, event
or omission that occurred prior to Closing, then in any of these instances
(each being defined as a " _Hydrotreater Completion Defect_ "), Buyer may
submit a written claim to the Escrow Agent, together with written
documentation in support of such claim, for reimbursement from the
Hydrotreater Escrow Account for any and all Losses Buyer or any of the
Companies or the AEC Subsidiary has or will incur as a consequence of such
Hydrotreater Completion Defect.

 



 

(b) The Hydrotreater Escrow Amount will be utilized solely to satisfy any
Losses of Buyer as a consequence of a Hydrotreater Completion Defect under
this _Section 10.25_. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the
Hydrotreater Escrow Amount may be drawn upon by Buyer, its successors or
assigns solely for the purpose of satisfying any Losses of Buyer or the
Companies or the AEC Subsidiary under this _Section 10.25_.

 



 

(c) If Buyer asserts a claim against the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount under this
_Section 10.25_ and Seller does not dispute such claim, Buyer shall be
entitled to an immediate disbursement from the Hydrotreater Escrow Account.
If, however, Seller disputes such claim, Buyer shall receive the undisputed
portion thereof, if any, but shall not be entitled to receive any such
disputed portion thereof from the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount with respect to
such claim prior to resolution of such Dispute and, if such Dispute extends
beyond the Hydrotreater Escrow Term, then the Hydrotreater Escrow Term will be
automatically extended as provided in _Section 10.25(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If Buyer claims for Losses against the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount of which
Seller has been notified prior to the expiration of the Hydrotreater Escrow
Term have been satisfied and no Dispute then exists for other applicable
claims, the balance of the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount plus the earned interest
and other income will be released to Seller on the first Business Day
immediately following the expiration of the Hydrotreater Escrow Term, and the
Escrow Agents obligation under the Escrow Agreement to disburse funds from
the Hydrotreater Escrow Account shall terminate. To the extent there exists a
claim against the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount by Buyer of which Seller has been
notified, which claim has not been satisfied in full in accordance herewith
prior to the expiration of the Hydrotreater Escrow Term, an amount equal to
the reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim hereunder by Seller will
be withheld from the balance of the Hydrotreater Escrow Amount and will
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such claim has been fully resolved and the Hydrotreater Escrow
Term shall be deemed to be extended accordingly and the balance of the
Hydrotreater Escrow Amount plus the earned interest and other income will be
released to Seller.

 



 

(e) Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver such instruction notices and
letters in writing to the Escrow Agent, and take such other actions, as may be
reasonably requested, to implement the terms hereof and to disburse the
Hydrotreater Escrow Amount as contemplated herein.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not be
entitled to, and Buyer, the Companies and the AEC Subsidiary shall be deemed
to have waived all claims and rights to, claims hereunder for any Losses to
the extent that reserves or accruals have been established or reflected on the
Final Balance Sheet for the Losses for which claims against the Hydrotreater
Escrow Amount are sought. All Losses claimed by a Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 10.25_ (whether or not resolved through the provisions hereof) shall
not be the subject of any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section
2.4_ and, by making a claim under this _Section 10.25_, Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the Companies and the AEC Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have
waived any rights it or they may have under _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_
with respect to any such Losses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, reimbursement from the Hydrotreater Escrow Account in accordance
with this _Section 10.25_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to Losses incurred by Buyer as a consequence of
a Hydrotreater Completion Defect, and Buyer shall not be entitled to seek any
other indemnification or compensation from Seller with respect to Hydrotreater
Completion Defects.
