AGREEMENT

with the Company that is either (i) in effect as of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement; or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, in either case containing
provisions that require any counterparty thereto (and any of its
Affiliates and representatives named therein) that receive material non-
public information of, or with respect to, the Company to keep
such information confidential; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case,
the confidentiality and use provisions contained therein are no less
restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its Affiliates
and representatives as provided therein) than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not
contain any "standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal). If the confidentiality and use
provisions of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement are less restrictive
in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its Affiliates and
representatives named therein) than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, such agreement will be deemed
to be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if the Company offers to amend
the Confidentiality Agreement so as to make the confidentiality and use

the confidentiality agreement signed by such counterparty.

Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such
purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer by any Person or Group that, if consummated in accordance with
its terms, would result in such Person or Group beneficially owning more
than 15% of the Company Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such tender or exchange offer;

  



  

(ii)  any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any
Person or Group of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value
thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or

  



  

(iii)  any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
other transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to which any Person or Group would, directly or indirectly, hold shares of
Company Common Stock representing more than 15% of the Company Common Stock
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction.

Surviving Corporation and by applicable Law.

(a)   _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the securities described in this _Section
2.7_ , the following will occur:

  



  

(i)  each limited liability company interest in Merger Sub
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

  



  

(ii)  each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares, Converted Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will
automatically be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to $6.50, without interest thereon (the "Per
Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.9_ (or in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an

_Section 2.11_);

  



  

(iii)  each share of Company Common Stock that is held directly by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will automatically be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor; and

  



  

(iv)  each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other

(b)   _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price
will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
subdivision, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change
with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders
who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in
writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares")
will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share
Price pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Such Company Stockholders will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall
have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.9_.

  



  

(ii)  The Company shall give Parent (A) notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
demand, notice or instruments delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands, waive any failure to comply with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  



  

 _2.8  Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Company RSUs_. Parent will not assume any Company RSUs
and at the Effective Time each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU (the "Company RSU Consideration"). The payment of the
Company RSU Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required
Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

   

\- 21 -

 



    



  

(b)   _Company PSUs_. Parent will not assume any Company PSUs
and at the Effective Time each Company PSU outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company PSU (the "Company PSU Consideration"). For purposes of the
previous sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to a
Company PSU award with performance-based vesting in which the
performance period is still outstanding as of the Effective Time will be
deemed to be the number of shares eligible to vest in accordance with the
applicable Company PSU award agreement. The payment of the Company PSU
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant
to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

(c)   _Company Options_. Parent will not assume any Company
Options and at the Effective Time each Company Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company
Option); multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
with respect to Company Options for which the exercise price per share
attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof. The payment of the Option Consideration will be
subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

(d)   _Company Restricted Stock_. Parent will not assume any
Company Restricted Stock and, at the _Effective_ Time, each Company
Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the
amount of the Per Share Price multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Restricted Stock (the "Company Restricted Stock Consideration").
The payment of the Company Restricted Stock Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.12_.

  



  

(e)   _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Company RSU Consideration owed
to all holders of Company RSUs; (ii) Company PSU Consideration owed to all
holders of Company PSUs; (iii) Company Restricted Stock Consideration owed to
all holders of Company Restricted Stock and (iv) Option Consideration owed to
all holders of Company Options. As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, but in any event no later than the later of (x) five Business Days
following the Closing Date and (y) the first regularly scheduled payroll date
following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company RSUs,
Company PSUs, Company Restricted Stock and Company Options will receive a
payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or
applicable Subsidiary employer), through its payroll system or payroll
provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of
Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options that
are cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_,  _Section 2.8(b)
Section 2.8(c)_ or _Section 2.8(d)_ , as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company RSUs, Company PSUs,
Company Restricted Stock or Company Options pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_, 
_Section 2.8(b), Section 2.8(c)_ or _Section 2.8(d)_ , as applicable, cannot
be made through the Company's, the Surviving Corporation's or the applicable
Subsidiary employer's payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Corporation will (i) by wire transfer or direct deposit, or (ii) by
a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by
overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in
no event later than the later of (x) five Business Days following the Closing
Date and (y) the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing
Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any such amounts
relate to a Company RSU, Company PSU, a Company Option or Company
Restricted Stock that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at
the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan
or arrangement relating to such Company RSU, Company PSU, Company Option or
Company Restricted Stock that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code.

  



  

   

\- 22 -

 



    



  

(f)   _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action
necessary to effect the cancellation of Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company
Restricted Stock and Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give
effect to this _Section 2.8_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements
of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). If and as required by
Parent or Merger Sub, the Company will take all action necessary to terminate
all Company Stock Plans prior to or as of the Effective Time.

  



  

 _2.9  Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. No less than 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, (i) Parent shall select a nationally recognized bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for
the Merger (the "Paying Agent"); and (ii) Parent shall enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent.

  



  

(b)   _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.7_, an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.7_. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any
losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section 2.7_; or (C) all
or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Paying
Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
_Section 2.7_ for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment
Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available
for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to
make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.7_. Any income from investment
of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
the payment to holders of Company Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.7_.

  



  

   

\- 23 -

 



    



  

(c)   _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective
Time (and in any event within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Owned
Company Shares or Converted Company Shares) of (i) a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares or
Converted Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)); and (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares or Converted
Company Shares) (the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) in the case of
Certificates, a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent); and (B) in the case of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares,
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by each such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price, and
the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such
Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's
transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price, and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Paying
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this _Section 2.9(c)_. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder
of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

  



  

(d)   _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Paying Agent
shall transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter an amount in cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price.

  



  

   

\- 24 -

 



    



  

(e)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and
the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the
Paying Agent that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g)   _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of
the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as
directed by Parent), together with any interest or other income received with
respect to the Payment Fund, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ will thereafter look for payment of
the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors,
assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

\- 25 -

 



    



  

 _2.10  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From
and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share
Price payable therefor in accordance with _Section 2.7_, or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_. The Per
Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there
will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will
(subject to compliance with the payment procedures of _Section 2.9(c)_) be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

  



  

 _2.11  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 2.7_. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

 _2.12  Required Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any
applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

they are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the

in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of "good standing"), except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the Charter and the Fifth Amended and Restated By-laws of

and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of shares of

"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder," or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation
enacted under the Laws of the State of Delaware is applicable to this
Agreement.

  



  

 _3.4  Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The adoption of this
Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger
(the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of
Company Common Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law,
the Charter or the Bylaws to consummate the Merger.

  



  

 _3.5  Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses
(b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or liens that have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 _3.6  Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval,
order or authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to

the part of the Company in connection with (a) the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) the

other party to the Financing Letters is in violation or breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth therein, and as of the date of this Agreement,

would, or would reasonably be expected to, (A) constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties thereto pursuant to the Financing Letters or (B) result in any
portion of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date

to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to be
satisfied by it in the Financing Letters or (2) the full amount of the

Acquisition Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in

Proposal is made public (it being understood that a "stop, look and listen"
statement by the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall
not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change) or after any
written request by Parent to do so (provided, that Parent may only make such
request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal in the absence of any
modification or revision to the price, conditions or other material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal); (D) fail to include the Company Board

Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:

  



  

(i)  if the Company has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or the Company
Special Committee) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal,
then the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) may (A) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into
a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board (or the Company
Special Committee) shall not take any action described in the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) unless:

  



  

(1)  following the Notice Period, the Company Board (or Company
Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that, after taking into
account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed by Parent in writing,
the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to cause the Company Board
(or Company Special Committee) to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

  



  

(2)  the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

  



  

(3)  (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent

(A) or (B) of _Section 5.3(e)(i)_ absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
actions, including the identity of the Person or Group making such
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all material
relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; (ii) during the
Notice Period (including as may be extended pursuant to the last sentence of
this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_ ), the Company and its Representatives have kept
Parent and its Representatives reasonably informed of the status of such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including promptly after receipt providing to Parent copies of any
additional or revised Acquisition Agreements), and (iii) the Company and its
Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have negotiated with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) would
no longer determine that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably expected
to cause the Company Board (or Company Special Committee) to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)(i)(3)_ with respect to such new
written notice (it being understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of
such new written notice will be the longer of two Business Days and the
number of Business Days remaining in the Notice Period); and

  



  

(4)  in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order
to cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(h)_, including paying (or causing to be paid) the Company Termination Fee
in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_;

Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or the
Company Special Committee) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change of
the kind set forth in clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof in response
to an Intervening Event if the Company Board (or the Company Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably expected to cause the Company Board (or Company Special Committee)
to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) shall not effect
such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

  



  

(1)  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or
the Company Special Committee) has (A) so determined and (B) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.3(e)(ii)_, which notice will specify the applicable Intervening Event in
reasonable detail; and

  



  

(2)  prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such three Business Day
period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or
the Company Special Committee) would no longer determine that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening
Event would be reasonably expected to cause the Company Board (or Company
Special Committee) to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(f)   _Notice_. From the No-Shop Period Start Date until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) notify Parent if any offers or proposals with respect to an

from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (i) the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such
offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is prohibited
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or
"group" of Persons that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); (ii) a
summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals; and
(iii) a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal and copies of all relevant
documents relating thereto. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such
offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations.

(g)   _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will
prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee)
from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, it being understood that a

Recommendation Change; (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A

Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) and the rights of Parent
under this _Section 5.3(g)_ ). In addition, it is understood and agreed that,
for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the
Company or the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) that
describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
will not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.

  



  

 _5.4  No Control of the Other Party's Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on

making of such filings; (ii) supply the other (or shall cause the other to be
supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings; and (iii) supply (or shall cause to be supplied) any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which
any such filing is made. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, if applicable), on the one hand, and the
Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to), on the other hand, promptly
inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding the Merger in connection with such filings. If any Party or
Affiliate thereof receives any comments or a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger, then such Party shall make (or shall cause to
be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other Parties, an appropriate response to such request;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Party may extend any waiting period or enter into any
agreement or understanding with any Governmental Authority without the
permission of the other Parties, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed.

(b)   _Avoidance of Impediments_. Parent and Merger Sub shall
take (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to take) all action
necessary, proper or advisable to (i) cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger; and (ii) obtain any required
consents, approvals or authorizations pursuant to any Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger, in each case as promptly as practicable and in any
event prior to the Termination Date. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the other covenants in this _Section 6.2_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Law so as to enable the consummation of the Merger to occur as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the Termination Date),
including taking all actions requested by any Governmental Authority, or
reasonably necessary to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger under any Antitrust Law.
Parent shall oppose fully and vigorously any request for, the entry of, and
seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree, injunction
or ruling of any Governmental Authority that could restrain, prevent or delay
any required consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the
Merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any
Person in any court or before any Governmental Authority and by exhausting all
avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse decision or order
by any Governmental Authority, it being understood that the costs and expenses
of all such actions shall be borne by Parent.

  



  

(c)   _Remedies_. Notwithstanding this _Section 6.2_ , nothing
in this Agreement will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to take, or agree to take, any action the effectiveness of which is
not conditioned on the Closing occurring.

  



  

(d)   _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable
Laws, (i) promptly notify the other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish
the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
others of the contents of) any substantive communication received by such
Person from a Governmental Authority or a private party in connection with
the Transaction and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance
(and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other Parties in
relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal notifications, filing,
submission or other written communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white
papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted
therewith) made in connection with the Transaction to a Governmental
Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties informed with respect to the status of
any such submissions and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transaction and any developments, meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including with respect to (A) the
receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver,
(B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under applicable Laws, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (D) the nature and status of any objections
raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transaction; and (iii) not independently participate in
any meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by
telephone or otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect
of the Transaction without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of
such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information
provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel"
only and any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or
directors or their equivalents of the other Party without approval of the
Party providing the non-public information; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and
related information before sharing any information provided to any
Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis,
and that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not in any event be
required to share information that benefits from legal privilege with the
other Parties, even on an "outside counsel" only basis, where this would
cause such information to cease to benefit from legal privilege.

(e)   _Other Actions_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any actions
that would reasonably be expected to result in any material delay in
obtaining, or to result in the failure to obtain, any regulatory approvals
required in connection with the Transaction, or which would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Transaction in any material
respect, including entering into or consummating any Contracts or
arrangements for an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger,
consolidation, purchase of assets, license or otherwise) of any ownership
interest, assets or rights of any Person that would reasonably be expected to
result in any material delay in obtaining, or to result in the failure to
obtain, any regulatory approvals required in connection with the Transaction,
or which would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
Transaction in any material respect.

  



  

 _6.3  Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

  



  

(a)   _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and
cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company)
shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended
or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company shall include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC without providing Parent and its counsel, to the
extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and
the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel.

  



  

(b)   _Other Required Company Filings_. If the Company
determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy
Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable
Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company
Filing"), then the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and
Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company) or Parent (as applicable)
shall promptly prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the
NYSE.

(c)   _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all
information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If
at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the
case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such
information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

  



  

(d)   _Notices and Subsequent Filings_. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall advise the other,
promptly after receiving notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the
SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt
of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a
request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
reasonably promptly as practicable to any such requests of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement or Other Required Company Filing, prior to filing such documents
with the SEC or disseminating them to the Company Stockholders, and a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information and comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, and shall consider any
comments proposed by Parent or its counsel in good faith.

  



  

(e)   _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the later of the (i) filing thereof with the
SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has
completed its review of, the Proxy Statement and (ii) No-Shop Period Start
Date.

 _6.4  Company Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a)   _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules and
regulations of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call and give
notice of a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting")
and, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders, convene and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Subject to _Section 5.3_ and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

  



  

(b)   _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent; _provided_ , that if at any time following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement, either the Company or Parent reasonably
determines in good faith that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is unlikely
to be obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting, including due to an
absence of quorum, then on no more than two occasions (for each of the
Company and Parent) and prior to the vote contemplated having been taken, the
Company shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such adjournment or postponement
shall delay the Company Stockholder Meeting by more than 10 days from the
prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth Business Day
preceding the Termination Date; _provided, further,_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
date of the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or an
order from the SEC or its staff; or (ii) the Company Board (or the Company
Special Committee) has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for any
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Company Stockholders (including in connection with any Company Board
Recommendation Change) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting but only for
up to such time that the Company Board determines (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law, including in
connection with the discharge of fiduciary duties of the Company Board (or the
Company Special Committee).

 _6.5  Financing_.

  



  

(a)   _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), permit or grant any withdrawal,
rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement, consent or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreement relating to the Financing if such
withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement, consent,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, including by changing the
amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of the Debt
Financing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any other
terms to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
materially delay or prevent the Closing; or (B) make the timely funding of
the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ , that Parent may (without the
consent of the Company) replace, modify, waive or amend the Debt
Commitment Letter (1) in accordance with the "market flex" provisions
thereof, and (2) to add, replace or substitute lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement substantially in
accordance with the terms in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_
, that any such addition, replacement or substitution of lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities would not
adversely affect the amount, timing, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly furnish to the
Company a true and complete copy of any amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification, consent or waiver relating to the Financing Letters. Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified and
(2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment Letters" or "Financing
Letters" will include such documents as amended or modified. Parent shall not
(without the consent of the Company) release or consent to the termination of
any individual lender under the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the first to
occur of Closing and the expiration of the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with its terms, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters; or (y)
replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing
commitments pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_.

  



  

(b)   _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain
the Financing on a timely basis, but in any event no later than the Closing
Date, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full exercise of any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) described in the
Financing Letters including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, enter into, execute and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters on a timely basis on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions contained
in the (A) Debt Commitment Letters, any related Fee Letter and such
definitive agreements related thereto and (B) Equity Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing Date, in each case, that are within their control; (iv)
upon the satisfaction (or waiver) of all the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,
including causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the Closing;
and (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters. Parent and
Merger Sub shall fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other
fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when they become due.

  



  

   

\- 61 -

 



    



  

(c)   _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed
on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing and (ii) provide the Company with drafts
(reasonably in advance of execution) of all definitive agreements and other
documents related to the Debt Financing and, thereafter, with true, complete
and executed copies of all such definitive agreements and other documents
related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice in
writing (but in any event within three Business Days after the occurrence or
discovery of) (A) of any breach (or threatened (in writing) breach), default
(or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default),
cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt
by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or threatened breach,
default, cancellation, termination or repudiation (or notice or communication
from Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub of any such actual or
threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation received
by Parent or Merger Sub) by any party to the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of
the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the
Debt Financing), solely to the extent that such disagreement or dispute
relates to the termination of, or the satisfaction of the conditions to, the
obligation of the Financing Sources party thereto to fund their commitments
thereunder; or (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing.

  



  

(d)   _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, or Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable, on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in writing (but in any event
within three Business Days after the occurrence or discovery thereof) and
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i)
arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing
from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to assure the
availability of the amount necessary to pay the Required Amount at the Closing
(A) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and
any related Fee Letter, (B) containing conditions to draw, conditions to
Closing and related terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the
availability thereof that (1) are not more onerous than those conditions and
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letter,
and (2) would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or make the
Closing materially less likely to occur (the "Alternate Debt Financing"); and
(ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such
Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"), which new
letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part.
Parent shall promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and
any fee letter in connection therewith or other agreements related thereto) to
the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained,
(A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt
Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to
the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect;
and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt
Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

  



  

   

\- 62 -

 



    



  

(e)   _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section 6.5_  shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations to consummate the
Transaction whether or not the Financing is available, and Parent and Merger
Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition
to the Closing.

  



  

 _6.6  Financing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a)   _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent

otherwise customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts in connection with:

consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Debt Financing and accountants' comfort letters, in each case
as reasonably requested by Parent), and otherwise reasonably cooperating with
Parent in facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting of
security interests required by the Debt Commitment Letters, it being
understood that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

on or prior to the Closing Date;

  



  

(vi)  taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to (A) permit the

to the expected Closing.

  



  

(b)   _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _Section
6.6_ will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it has not received prior
reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii)

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives

and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to

_Section 6.6_ that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such Representative; or (B) the Company Board (or the Company
Special Committee) to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior

financing sources or prospective financing sources and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their

negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or
intentional breach of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any

committee thereof) and Parent shall (a) take all reasonable actions within
their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transaction and (b) if any "anti-
takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the
Transaction, take all reasonable actions within their power to ensure that the
Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transaction.

or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound as of the date of this
Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a
third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such
Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
(including any source code) of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the
Company or any third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are
reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other
hand; _provided_ that in each case described in clauses (a) through (d) the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to develop alternative methods of providing such information in a
manner that would not result in any violation, default, prejudice or loss of
privilege. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ will be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that (i) does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and
timely discharge by Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties or (ii) create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will
not include the right to perform invasive or other testing or sampling of any
environmental media. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Representatives in connection with any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.8_.

 _6.10  Directors' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a)   _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers,
employees or agents (and any person who becomes a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Person's heirs, executors
and administrators, an "Indemnified Person" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Persons") in effect on the date of this Agreement and made
available to Parent. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as of the date
of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law.

  



   

(b)   _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the
generality of the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements
with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in effect on the
date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs,
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever
asserted, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of, or pertains, directly or indirectly, to, (i) the fact
that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate; and (ii) any action or omission,
or alleged action or omission occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction), in such Indemnified Person's capacity as
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the Company or
such Subsidiary or Affiliate, including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation shall advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses
of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such
Legal Proceeding; _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws or other applicable
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their
respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of,
any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the
fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c)   _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect
to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are no less
favorable than those of the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 200% amount, the
"Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier so
long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as
such "tail" policy is in full force and effect and the Surviving Corporation
and Parent will be relieved of their obligations under the first sentence of
this _Section 6.10(c)_. If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" policy
and Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance
described in this _Section 6.10(c)_ for an amount less than or equal to the
Maximum Annual Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Annual Premium.

  



  

(d)   _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfer or convey all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(e)   _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.10_ may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who
is a beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if
such Indemnified Persons or other Persons were a party to this Agreement. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this _Section
6.10_ will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such Persons may have pursuant to (i) Organizational Documents of the
Company; (ii) the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or
in equity).

  



  

   

\- 68 -

 



    



  

(f)   _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to
this _Section 6.10_ will be joint and several.

  



  

(g)   _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors'
and officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

 _6.11  Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of
the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _Existing Arrangements_. If requested by Parent at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to adopt written resolutions approved in advance
in writing by Parent's legal counsel (a copy of which shall be delivered to
Parent at the Closing) to terminate any Employee Plans that contain a cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
("Company 401(k) Plan") effective at least the day prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs (but contingent upon the Closing). In the event of
such Parent direction to terminate such Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to, effective within two (2) Business Days
following the Effective Time, make available a replacement 401(k) plan for
employees who were actively participating in the Company 401(k) Plan and
cause such plan to accept direct rollovers from the Company 401(k) Plan, as
directed by such employees. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Employee Plans not so terminated in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 6.11_ ,
nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any such Employee Plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required pursuant to applicable Law.

  



  

   

\- 69 -

 



    



  

(c)   _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one year following
the Effective Time or, if earlier, their termination of employment or other
service (the "Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) provide compensation benefits to each Continuing
Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the compensation benefits (but excluding equity-based, defined benefit, and
retiree welfare benefits or compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Employee Plans ("Comparable
Plans"). In each case, and without limiting the foregoing, base salary or
base wage rate, and annual target cash incentive compensation opportunity will
not be decreased below levels in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time during the Continuation Period for any Continuing Employee employed
during that period. During the Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance
benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Company's Employee
Plans as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)   _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or
Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance entitlement),
except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the same period of service
where prior service credit is not awarded to similarly situated employees, or
under any equity-based, defined benefit, or retiree welfare benefits or
compensation). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit
plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company Plans) (such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that coverage
pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding
Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans") to the extent the Continuing
Employee had previously satisfied the requirements to participate in such
comparable Old Plan; (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life
insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to
any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied
under any comparable Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date that such Continuing Employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall credit the accounts of such Continuing
Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any
unused balance in the account of any such Continuing Employee under an Old
Plan that was a flexible spending plan.

(e)   _2019 Management Incentive Plan_. Parent will assume the
Company's 2019 Management Incentive Plan and all annual incentive bonus
opportunities thereunder as of the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time Parent will maintain the Company's 2019 Management Incentive Plan in
accordance with its terms on the date hereof and will pay or provide to each
participating employee following the Effective Time a bonus in respect of
calendar year 2019, if earned, as in accordance with the Company's
2019 Management Incentive Plan in a manner that is consistent with the
Company's past practice.

  



  

(f)   _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 6.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee; (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section 6.11_,
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee (or beneficiary
or dependent thereof).

permitted (A) to increase the rate of his or her payroll deductions thereunder
from the rate in effect on the date of this Agreement or to commence new
contributions or (B) to make other non-payroll contributions to the Company
ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement and (ii) terminate the
Company ESPP, and all outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior

failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective
covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

 _6.14  Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Transaction will be a joint press release
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before

obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that
are (i) required by applicable Law or stock exchange rule or listing
agreement; (ii) principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers,
partners or vendors; or (iii) not inconsistent with public statements
previously made in accordance with this _Section 6.14_. Notwithstanding

be made, by the Company in accordance with _Section 5.3_ or in connection
with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the
Transaction.

compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction
Litigation unless the other Parties have consented thereto in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For
purposes of this  _Section 6.15_, "participate" means that each Party (i)
will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Party receiving notice of
Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between such Party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected),

and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement

then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days
after such consummation) pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this _Section
8.3(b)(i)_, all references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition

(ii)  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within three
Business Days following such termination) pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent

pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and at the time of such termination the Company

Company an amount equal to $11,340,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated

(d)   _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that in no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the
occurrence of different events.

  



  

(e)   _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Transaction, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any
amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company
for the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a
judgment against Parent for the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ or
any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent

or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 _9.4  Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
letter agreement, dated July 31, 2019 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that

Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall hold and treat

instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Financing Letters, constitute the entire agreement

and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by _Section 6.10_; (b) each
Parent Related Party shall be an express third-party beneficiary of _Section
8.3_ , _Section 9.10_ , _Section 9.11_ , _Section 9.12_ and this _Section

the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or

provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 _9.8  Remedies_.

  



  

(a)   _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, under no circumstances will the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in the occurrence of the Closing and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee.

  



  

(b)   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(i)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required
of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (A) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.3(f)_
and this _Section 9.8_ , the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (in each case, other than
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to effect the Closing, which shall be
governed exclusively by _Section 9.8(b)(ii)_ ); (B) the provisions of
_Section 8.3_ are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party's right to
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief; and (C)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transaction and,
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. The Parties further agree that (1) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.8_ , a Party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party
under this Agreement; and (2) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.8_ shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.8_
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article
VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.8_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.8_ restrict or limit any Party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

  



  

   

\- 83 -

 



    



  

(ii)  Notwithstanding _Section 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged
and agreed that the right of the Company to a remedy of specific performance
to enforce Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and
to consummate the Merger will be subject to the requirements that (A) all of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing);
(B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ; and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or
to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not
be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

  



  

(iii)  Subject to _Section 8.3(f)_ and this _Section 9.8_ , the
Parties agree not to assert in any action for specific performance the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

  



  

 _9.9  Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes, claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transaction or
the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its
statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
Laws or other rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws or statutes of
limitations of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

 _9.10  Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a)   _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a)

other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transaction, for and
on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with
_Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law,
and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of

particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the
"Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, the Transaction or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d)
agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement,
the Transaction or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be
brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any

Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in
an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f)
agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Transaction or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts

(b)   _Jurisdiction for Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and
irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in Law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising
out of, or relating to, the Transaction, the Debt Financing or the performance
of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New
York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each
Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing
any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses provided in any applicable Debt Commitment Letter will
be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to

such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York.

THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO

CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE FINANCING LETTERS,
THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING
SOURCES) OR THE OTHER AGREEMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH,
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT

 _9.12  No Recourse_. Without limiting Parent's rights and remedies
against the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letters, this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no
Parent Related Parties (other than Investor to the extent set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter) shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transaction or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith.

  



  

 _9.13  Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree
that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(ii) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

  



  

 _9.14  Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may
be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties,
it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an
"Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

  



  

 _9.15  Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the
Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action
by the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee)); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement
that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL
without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in
_Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.9_ , _Section 9.10(b)_ , _Section 9.11_ and this
_Section 9.15_ (and the defined terms used therein) may not be amended,
modified or altered without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein.
