Transaction Expenses will have been prepared in accordance with the applicable
definitions set forth herein and the Accounting Principles. For the avoidance
of doubt, the acceptance by Purchaser of the Estimated Closing Date Statement

SHARE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT


without giving effect to any purchase accounting adjustments resulting from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b)Until such time as the Final Closing Date Statement shall become final in
accordance with Section 2.4(c), NPH shall permit Purchaser and its
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Books
and Records and personnel of each member of the Company Group and the parties
providing accounting services under the Transition Services Agreement
("Accounting Services Providers") to aid in Purchaser's review of the Closing
Date Statement; provided, however, NPH shall not be required to provide such
access or disclose such materials to the extent such access or disclosure
would unreasonably interfere with the normal business or operations of NPH or
the Accounting Services Providers or, as determined by counsel in good faith,
(i) any such materials are subject to the terms of a non-disclosure agreement
or undertaking with a third party as of the date thereof, (ii) any such
materials constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney
work product, or (iii) disclosure of any such materials would be prohibited by
Law. Purchaser shall have the right to review the work papers of NPH and the
Accounting Services Providers underlying or utilized in preparing the Closing
Date Statement and the calculation of the actual Purchase Price, subject to
the execution of a customary access letter, including the actual Cash Amount,
the actual Working Capital, the actual Closing Indebtedness, and the actual
Transaction Expenses, as of the Measurement Time on the Closing Date, as set
forth in the Closing Date Statement to the extent reasonably necessary to
verify the accuracy of the Closing Date Statement and the calculation of Final
Purchase Price, including the Final Cash Amount, the Final Working Capital,
the Final Closing Indebtedness, and the Final Transaction Expenses in
conformity with this Agreement.



(c)Within 30 calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date Statement,
Purchaser shall either inform NPH in writing that the Closing Date Statement
is acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail
a description of each of its objections. If Purchaser does not provide NPH
with written notice of its objection to or acceptance of the Closing Date
Statement, Purchaser will be deemed for all purposes to have accepted the
Closing Date Statement as presented to it. If Purchaser so objects, and
Purchaser and NPH do not resolve such objections on a mutually agreeable basis
within 30 calendar days after NPH's receipt of such objections, the remaining
disputed items shall be submitted to Deloitte LLP ("Deloitte") or, if Deloitte
is not available for such engagement or at the time of such proposed
engagement is no longer independent, such other nationally recognized
independent certified public accounting firm reasonably agreed to by Purchaser
and NPH (Deloitte, or such other accounting firm mutually agreed to by NPH and
Purchaser, the "Accounting Firm"). All such discussions between NPH and
Purchaser regarding the objections (including any written materials exchanged
in connection with such discussions) shall be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. Purchaser and
NPH shall promptly execute any reasonable engagement letter requested by
Accounting Firm and shall each cooperate fully with Accounting Firm, including
by providing the information, data and work papers used by each Party to
prepare or calculate the Closing Date Statement, so as to enable Accounting
Firm to make such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable,
but shall be under no obligation to provide such information to the other
party once the matter has been submitted to the Accounting Firm. If Purchaser
and NPH cannot agree on an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm
within 10 calendar days of determining that an Accounting Firm other than
Deloitte must be appointed as contemplated above, then Purchaser and/or NPH
may submit a request to JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services, Inc.) requesting appointment of a nationally recognized
independent certified public accounting firm to serve as Accounting Firm.
Purchaser and NPH shall direct the Accounting Firm to resolve such disputed
items within 30 calendar days of submission of the disputed items. Upon the
agreement of Purchaser and NPH, the decision of the Accounting Firm, or if
Purchaser fails to deliver an objection to NPH within the first 30-day period
referred to above, then the Closing Date Statement, as the same may be
adjusted as a result of agreement of the Parties or the decision of the
Accounting Firm (the "Final Closing Date

Statement"), shall be final, conclusive, and binding against the Parties
hereto including the calculation of the Closing Indebtedness ("Final Closing
Indebtedness"), the Cash Amount ("Final Cash Amount"), the Working Capital
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, is calculated after taking into account
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, as of the end of
the Closing Date) ("Final Working Capital"), the Transaction Expenses (the
"Final Transaction Expenses") and the resulting Final Purchase Price set forth
therein. No adjustment shall occur (i) as a result of the actual cost of
repairs to the Statia Facility exceeding the mutually agreed upon Repair
Budget or (ii) in respect of costs relating to the excess water referred to in
the definition of Water Removal Cost exceeding the mutually agreed upon Water
Removal Cost.



(d)In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this Section 2.4 and the other terms, provisions, and
definitions set forth in this Agreement, (ii) shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by NPH or Purchaser, (iii) shall limit
its decision to such items as are in dispute, and (iv) shall make its
determination based solely on written presentations by NPH and Purchaser that
are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent review). The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated by the Accounting Firm
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in the
same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted
to the Accounting Firm are unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as
finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such
disputed items so disputed.



(e)Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.4:



(i)in the event that the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to NPH, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, payment in an amount equal to (x) the
Final Purchase Price, minus (y) the Estimated Purchase Price;



(ii)in the event that the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase
Price, then NPH shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to (x) the Estimated
Purchase Price, minus (y) the Final Purchase Price.

Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.4(e) shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 2.5 Deposit. Within five (5) Business Days of the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser will deliver to NuStar Logistics, L.P., on behalf of
Sellers, an earnest money deposit in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) (the "Deposit").



(a)Prior to Closing, the Deposit will be held by NuStar Logistics, L.P. in
escrow in a segregated account.



(b)If this Agreement is terminated (i) after the Outside Date pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) (including as a result of the condition set forth in Section
7.3(e) not being met), or (ii) at any time in accordance with Section 8.1(e),
then the Deposit may be retained by NuStar Logistics, L.P. on behalf of
Sellers; provided, however, notwithstanding subsection (i) immediately above,
NuStar Logistics, L.P. shall have no right to retain the Deposit if the
failure of Sellers to fulfill any of their obligations under this Agreement
has been a material cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the Outside Date.

| 

SHARE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT


(c)If the Closing fails to occur prior to the Outside Date for any other
reason (including (i) due to any exercise of the termination rights set forth
in Section 8.1(d), or (ii) notwithstanding subsection (i) of Section 2.5(b),
the issuance of a Prohibitive Order against or relating to any or all of
NuStar, Sellers, or any member of the Company Group without regard to which
Party terminates the Agreement or which subsection of Section 8.1 is relied
upon to so terminate), the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereupon) shall
be returned to Purchaser's account, without any deduction or set-off
whatsoever, within not more than three (3) Business Days of the earlier of (x)
the date of the corresponding notice of termination or (y) the Outside Date,
as applicable.



(d)If the Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be credited against the Purchase
Price at the Closing.



Section 2.6 Purchase Price Allocation. Consistent with the principles of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, the Purchase
Price (and any other items constituting consideration for U.S. federal income
tax purposes), as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4, will be allocated
in a manner consistent with such Code section. On or before the day that is
180 days after the Closing Date (and if such 180th day is not a Business Day
then the next Business Day), Purchaser will provide NPH with Purchaser's
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price. NPH may, within 15 days after the
date of delivery of Purchaser's proposed allocation (and if such 15th day is
not a Business Day then the next Business Day), notify Purchaser, in writing,
of all revisions desired by NPH to Purchaser's proposed allocation, explaining
in sufficient detail all of such proposed revisions. If NPH does not provide
such notice within such 15-day period, NPH (for and on behalf of Sellers as
provided for in Section 11.17) will be deemed to have accepted Purchaser's
allocation of the Purchase Price for all purposes. If NPH timely provides
proposed revisions to Purchaser's proposed allocation, Purchaser shall
consider in good faith all reasonable proposals made by NPH. In the event
Purchaser disagrees with any (or all) of NPH's proposals (assuming such were
timely made), and Purchaser and NPH cannot resolve such disagreement(s) within
30 days after the receipt of NPH's comments (and if such 30th day is not a
Business Day then the next Business Day), either Party may submit all (but not
less than all) disputed items (but only the disputed items) to the Accounting
Firm for resolution thereof, and Purchaser and NPH agree that the decision of
the Accounting Firm with respect to such item(s) will be binding on them for
all purposes of this Agreement. NPH and Purchaser each agree to file, or in
the case of NPH cause the Sellers to file, all relevant Tax Returns, wherever
filed, consistent with the final allocation of the Purchase Price.



Section 2.7 Section 338(g) Election. Purchaser and each Seller agrees that
Purchaser shall make a Section 338(g) election under the Code on or before the
15th day of the ninth (9th) month following the month in which the Closing
occurs, as it relates to the purchase of the stock of SSS.



Section 2.8 Withholding Rights. Purchaser or any other applicable withholding
agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to or as contemplated by the Transaction Documents, such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of the Transaction Documents as having been paid to
such Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(b)by Purchaser or NPH, by written notice to the other Party, if the Closing
shall not have occurred by 11:59 p.m. Central Time on July 31, 2019 (the
"Outside Date"); provided, however, the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to a Party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been a
material cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date and time;



(c)by either Purchaser or NPH, by written notice to the other Party, if any
Prohibitive Order permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c)(i) shall not be available to a Party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been a material cause of, or
resulted in, the Prohibitive Order;



(d)by Purchaser, by written notice to NPH, if Sellers have (i) breached or

in this Agreement, or (ii) failed to deliver the certificate described in
Section 2.3(a)(v), such that (a) the conditions set forth in Section 7.3 would
not be satisfied or would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied as of the
Closing, and (b) any such breach or failure to perform cannot be cured by
Sellers or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within the
earlier

SHARE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT


of (x) 30 days after receipt by NPH of notice in writing from Purchaser,
specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be cured, and (y)
three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(d) if it is then in breach of any of its obligations under
this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section
7.2(a), Section 7.2(b), or Section 7.2(c) cannot be satisfied; or



(e)by NPH, by written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser has breached or failed
to perform in any material respect any of its obligations set forth in this
Agreement, (i) such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section
7.2 would not be satisfied or would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied
as of the Closing, and (ii) such breach or failure to perform cannot be cured
by Purchaser or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.



(a)Subject to the other terms hereof, if this Agreement is terminated as
provided in this Article 8, this Agreement shall become null and void and of
no further force or effect, except for the provisions of:

(i)the Confidentiality Agreement;



(ii)this Section 8.2; and



(iii)Article 11; and



(iv)any corresponding definitions.



Subject to Section 8.2(b), nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to
extinguish any right or remedy of any Party that shall have accrued hereunder
prior to any such termination, or release any Party from any liability for
fraud or any breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.

(b)Purchaser and Sellers agree that based upon the circumstances now existing,
known and unknown, it would be impractical or extremely difficult to establish
Sellers' Damages by reason of Purchaser's non-performance, default or breach
of this Agreement prior to Closing. Accordingly, in the event Sellers retain
the Deposit as provided for in this Agreement, Purchaser and Sellers agree
that it would be reasonable in the event of such non-performance, default, or
breach by Purchaser to award Sellers "liquidated damages" equal to the amount
of the Deposit. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
amount is reasonable as liquidated damages and shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Sellers in lieu of any other relief, right, or remedy, at law or in
equity, to which Sellers might otherwise be entitled by reason of such non-
performance, default, or breach by Purchaser hereunder.

employees of the Sellers or their Affiliates as set forth on Section 9.2 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules hired by Purchaser, Purchaser's Affiliates, or
any member of the Company Group, with salary or wage levels and cash bonus
opportunities (excluding change-in-control, retention, equity or equity-based
bonus opportunities), to the extent applicable, and with employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those provided to each such employee
as of the Closing Date.



Section 9.2 Obligations to Employees.



(a)Purchaser (A) shall (or shall cause Purchaser's Affiliate or a member of
the Company Group to), within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date,
make an offer of employment to certain of those employees listed on Section
9.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules that Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
deems necessary to Purchaser's operation of the Statia Facility (the "Up-tier
Employees"), (B) shall cause the Company Group to continue to employ each
local employee of the Company Group set forth on Section 9.2 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules ("On-Island Employees"), (C) will assume the contracts
for each expatriate employee who was sent to work at the Statia Facility set
forth on Section 9.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules ("On-Island Expat
Employee") and (D) will, within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date,
cause the Company Group to employ each On-Island Expat Employee. Each such
employment offer to an Up-tier Employee and the continued terms of employment
for each an On-Island Employee and each On-Island Expat Employee shall be for
a position at a salary or wage that is no less than the aggregate compensation
paid to such employee as of the Closing.



(i)With respect to Up-tier Employees and On-Island Expat Employees, each such
employee shall remain an employee of the NuStar Affiliate and costs of
employment shall be reimbursed as provided in the Transition Services
Agreement; provided, that, should such Up-tier Employee accept an offer from
the Purchaser and become an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliate (each, a
"Transferred Employee"), such payroll and benefits shall be promptly
transitioned to Purchaser or its Affiliate and shall be removed from the scope
of the Transition Services Agreement without any duplication of cost to
Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (including the Companies). Up-Tier Employees
not offered employment by Purchaser will, nonetheless, continue to be employed
by the NuStar Affiliate post-Closing and made available to Purchaser to
provide services to Purchaser under the Transition Services Agreement for a
period no less than sixty (60) days after the thirty (30) day period described
in Section 9.2(a) has expired.



(ii)With respect to On-Island Employees, such employee shall remain an
employee of the applicable member of the Company Group with locally processed
payroll continuing following Closing.



(iii)With respect to all On-Island Expat Employees, such employees shall
remain employees of the NuStar Affiliate and payroll and benefits will be
processed under and reimbursed as provided in the Transition Services
Agreement with such payroll and benefits pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement to be promptly transitioned to Purchaser or its Affiliate and
removed from the scope of the Transition Services Agreement without any
duplication of cost to Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (including the
Companies).

Purchaser further agrees that each Transferred Employee, On-Island Employee
and On-Island Expat Employee (collectively, the "Statia Employees") will be
eligible to participate in Purchaser's employee benefit plans that are
generally applicable to Purchaser's other employees.

(b)If Purchaser takes any action following Closing that independently, and
solely by reason thereof, could be construed as a "plant closing,"
"relocation," "employment loss" or "mass layoff" or other similar term under
applicable Laws, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing any
notice required by applicable Law and for making payments, if any, and paying
all penalties, and costs, if any, that may result from any failure to provide
such notice or failure to comply with such applicable Laws.



(c)With respect to any Plans in which any Statia Employee participates after
the Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause a member of the Company Group or
another of Purchaser's Affiliates, as applicable, to) use reasonable best
efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such employees, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods are applied under the similar plan in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid (to the same extent such credit was given for
the year under the similar plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, (iii)
recognize all continuous service of each of the employees with Terminals or
each of the employees set forth on Section 9.2 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules (including continuous service with an entity that was previously
acquired by such Person), for all purposes (including for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting credit and entitlement to benefits, but
excluding benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under any
plan, arrangement, policy, program or agreement in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing; provided, however the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits and
shall not apply to any equity or equity-based benefits or any benefits
provided to Union Employees, which shall continue to be governed by the
Collective Labor Agreement, and (iv) Statia Employees will be eligible for
vacation, short-term leave entitlement and, to the extent Purchaser or its
Affiliates adopts any service recognition program, service award recognition
based on years of service set forth in Section 9.2 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules.



(d)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Terminals, effective as of the
occurrence of the Closing, remains bound by the Collective Labor Agreement.



(e)Nothing in this Section 9.2 shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person, including any current or former employee, any participant
in any Plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof other than the parties to
this Agreement and NuStar (or any wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar who
employed Statia Employees prior to Closing), (ii) constitute an amendment to
or establishment of any Plan or any other plan, program, policy, agreement or
other arrangement covering current or former employees, independent
contractors or other service providers of any member of the Company Group or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any employees set forth in Section 9.2

unliquidated, or known or unknown, and whether arising under any agreement,
instrument, or understanding or otherwise at law or equity, other than any
obligation of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.



(b)Nothing contained in this Section 9.3 is intended to, nor does it: (i)
extend to any claims in respect of this Agreement or any of the provisions set
forth herein, or (ii) affect any right to indemnification, exculpation or
advancement of expenses to which either Seller or any Seller Related Party may
be entitled as a result of such Person's interest in or service as a manager,

Purchaser or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any Transaction Document or

other actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and
intent of this Agreement.



Section 9.6 Post-Closing Access. In connection with any matter relating to any
period prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
upon the reasonable request and at the expense of Sellers, and subject to
reasonable confidentiality protections, permit NPH and any of its
representatives access at all reasonable times, during normal business hours,
to the Books and Records to enable Sellers to prepare and/or file Tax Returns

GENERAL PROVISIONS



Section 11.1 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all actions, causes of action,
claims, cross-claims, third-party claims or Litigation of any kind (whether at
Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto), any certificate, instrument or other documents delivered hereunder,
or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim or Litigation
of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of Laws.



Section 11.2 Consent to Jurisdiction.



(a)Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery located in Wilmington, Delaware (or if, but only if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware or the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware, in each case located in Wilmington, Delaware), and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any certificate, instrument or other documents
delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or
thereof (including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim or Litigation of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to
any representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or
therewith), or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind shall be heard and determined
in such state or federal court, (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim or Litigation of any kind arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any certificate, instrument or other documents delivered hereunder,
or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation
of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) in such courts, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind in any such court and (iv)
agrees that a final judgment in any such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
the applicable address set forth in Section 11.10 below shall be effective
service of process for any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim or Litigation of any kind brought in any such court.



(b)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE BASED
UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS AND
SCHEDULES HERETO), ANY CERTIFICATE, INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENTS DELIVERED
HEREUNDER, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF
(INCLUDING ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM, THIRD-PARTY CLAIM
OR LITIGATION OF ANY KIND BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION

SHARE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT


HEREWITH OR THEREWITH) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.



Section 11.3 Remedies. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the Party seeking the injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief has an adequate remedy of Law. The remedies available to Sellers
pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which it is entitled at Law or in equity.



Section 11.4 Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may be modified only by a
written instrument executed by the Parties hereto. Any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing (subject to applicable
Law) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date by the Party entitled to the
benefits thereof.



Section 11.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
other prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, express or
implied, between the Parties hereto and their respective Affiliates,
representatives and agents in respect of the subject matter hereof, except
that this Agreement does not supersede the Confidentiality Agreement, the
terms and conditions of which the Parties hereto expressly reaffirm.



Section 11.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
found to be, by competent authority with jurisdiction, invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.



Section 11.7 Expenses. Except as expressly provided herein to the contrary,
whether or not the transactions contemplated herein shall be consummated, each
Party shall pay its own expenses incident to the preparation and performance
of this Agreement.



Section 11.8 Parties in Interest; Joinder. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that (i)
the Non-Party Affiliates shall be considered third-party beneficiaries of
Section 11.16, (ii) each Seller Related Party shall be considered third-party
beneficiaries of Section 6.3(b), Section 9.7, Section 9.8, Section 10.1,
Section 10.2, and Section 10.3, and (iii) JW and

each Seller Related Party shall be considered third-party beneficiaries of
Section 11.16 and Section 11.18, and each such party shall have the right to
enforce the Section to which it is a third-party beneficiary.



Section 11.9 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay on the part
of any Party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise
thereof, or of any other right.



Section 11.10 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or
made as follows: (i) if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, upon receipt; (ii) if sent by reputable overnight air courier (such

convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the

Section 11.16 No Recourse. Except as expressly set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement or claims based on fraud, all claims, obligations,
liabilities, or causes of action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement

demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available, whether at Law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, to avoid or disregard the entity
form of a Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Non-Party
Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency,
control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise,
in each case arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any

including the exercise of the power to: (i) execute this Agreement, any

SHARE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT


agreements, documents and certificates pursuant to such agreements, and take
all actions required or permitted to be taken under such agreements; (ii)
resolve, agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to this
Agreement and any Transaction Document; (iii) receive and forward notices and
communications pursuant to this Agreement and any Transaction Document; and
(iv) take all other actions necessary, desirable or appropriate in the
reasonable judgment of NPH for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of
the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement, any Transaction
Document and any other agreements, documents and certificates pursuant
thereto. NPH hereby accepts its appointment as the representative of NTD for
such purposes. All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of NPH shall
be final, conclusive and binding upon all Sellers, and NTD shall not have any
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.



(b)Expenses and Liabilities. Any expenses or Liabilities incurred by the NPH
in connection with the performance of its duties as a representative for NTD
under this Agreement or any Transaction Document shall not be an obligation of
NPH but shall be reimbursed by NTD.



(c)No Liability. NTD agrees to indemnify NPH for, and to hold NPH harmless
against, any losses or Liabilities incurred without fraud, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of NPH, arising out of or in connection with
NPH's carrying out its duties under this Section 11.17, including costs and
expenses of successfully defending NPH or any agent acting on behalf of NPH
against any claim of liability with respect thereto. NPH may consult with
counsel of its own choice and will have full and complete authorization and
protection for any action taken and suffered by it in good faith and in
accordance with the opinion of such counsel.



(d)Reliance. Purchaser and any other third party will be entitled to rely on
any and all actions taken by NPH based on this Section 11.17 without any
Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, NTD. Purchaser and any such other
third party is and will be fully protected in, and shall not have any
Liability to NTD as a result of, acting or refraining from acting upon and
relying upon any notice, instruction, direction, request, waiver, consent,
receipt or other paper or document in writing that Purchaser or such other
third party in good faith believes has been signed by NPH.



Section 11.18 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Purchaser (on its
behalf and, from and after the Closing, on behalf of each member of the
Company Group) hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with JW representing the Sellers or any
Seller Related Party after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Purchaser, any member of the Company Group or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser (on its behalf and, from and after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company Group) hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between Purchaser or any member of the Company Group,
on the one hand, and Sellers or any Seller Related Party, on the other hand,
JW may represent any or all of Sellers or any Seller Related Party in such
dispute even though the interests of Sellers or the Seller Related Parties may
be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective
Affiliates. In addition, all privileged communications by Sellers, any Company
Group member or the Seller Related Parties that reasonably related to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be privileged communications that belong solely to
Sellers and the Seller Related Parties (and not Purchaser or any Company Group
member). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the
Closing, (i) Sellers and the Seller Related Parties (and not Purchaser, any
Company Group member or their respective Affiliates) shall be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such protected
communications, and none of Purchaser, the Company Group members or their
respective Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, and (ii) to the extent that
the files of JW in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only Sellers and the Seller Related Parties (and not Purchaser, the
Company Group or their respective Affiliates)

shall hold such property rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a third party other than a Party, on the other hand, (i) any member
of the Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of such privileged communications to such third party and (ii) NPH,
on behalf of itself and NTD, shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a
waiver of attorney-client privilege to permit the disclosure of privileged
communications to Purchaser or the Company Group in connection with the
defense of such dispute.
