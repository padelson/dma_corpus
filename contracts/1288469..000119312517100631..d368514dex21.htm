advisable and in the best interest of its respective stockholder(s) to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company

Agreement and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the

thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an

WHEREAS, the Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and will be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon

is advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken together, are
at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company Stockholders and (iii) approved this Agreement and the

the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a

into this Agreement, the Key Stockholders shall enter into Support Agreements
with Parent (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Support

cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive
only those rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Company Shares
held by a stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholders right to appraisal under

or settle or offer to settle or compromise any such demands for payment in

(d) _Stock Awards of the Company; Company ESPP_.

 

(i) _Vested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Award
that is a stock option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") (or portion thereof) with an exercise price less
than the Merger Consideration that is outstanding and vested immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any Company Stock Option that accelerates
and becomes vested and exercisable on or prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the

 



-21- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or a termination of the
holders service in connection with such transactions) (each such Company
Stock Option, a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive a cash payment, if any, without interest and subject
to applicable tax withholding, equal to the product of (x) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option,
multiplied by (y) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the
exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option (with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded to the nearest whole cent) (the aggregate
amount of which, the " _Option Award Amount_ ").

(ii) _Unvested Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, is held by
a Continuing Service Provider, is solely subject to time-based vesting and is
not a Vested Company Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ ") shall be assumed
by Parent and converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, as provided herein. Each such Assumed Option shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
schedule applicable thereto, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number
rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock), and
(B) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share exercise price at which such
Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
the Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed
Option that qualified as a United States-based incentive stock option (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, and further, that
the assumption of the Assumed Options shall be effected in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this _Section_ __ _
3.6(d)(ii)_ will be construed consistent with this intent. Each Company Stock
Option that is not a Vested Company Option and that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person that is not a Continuing
Service Provider shall not be assumed by Parent and by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall have no further effect following
the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Vested Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance Stock Unit that is
outstanding and becomes vested immediately prior to or at the Effective Time
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each such
Company Restricted Stock Unit and Company Performance Stock Unit, a "
_Vested Company Unit_ ") shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment, without interest and subject to applicable tax
withholding, equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Unit, multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the
nearest whole cent) (the aggregate amount of which, the " _Unit Award Amount_
").

 

(iv) _Unvested Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a
Continuing Service Provider and that is solely subject to time-based vesting
and is not a Vested Company Unit (each, an " _Assumed Unit_ "), shall
be assumed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Assumed Unit shall
be converted into an award to receive that number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit immediately
prior to the Effective

 



-22- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, with the resulting number rounded
down to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock. Each Assumed
Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
as to vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective Company
Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Each Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company
Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is not a Vested Company Unit and is held by a Person that is not a
Continuing Service Provider shall not be assumed by Parent and by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall have no further
effect following the Effective Time.

 

(v) _Unvested Performance Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Performance Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is neither a Vested Company Option nor an Assumed
Option (each, an " _Unvested Company Performance Option_ ") shall be converted
into an unvested award (" _Converted Performance Option_ ") representing the
right to receive an option to acquire Parent Class A Common Stock calculated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.6(d)(ii)_. Each
Converted Performance Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including as to vesting, exercisability and issuance) as were
applicable under the respective Unvested Company Performance Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all performance-vesting
criteria applicable to performance periods ending after the Companys fiscal
year 2017 are deemed to be achieved at target levels as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Converted Performance
Option tranche with a performance period concluding on or before the end of
the Companys fiscal year 2017 shall vest only to the extent that either the
applicable performance criteria are achieved or such Converted Performance
Option accelerates pursuant to the holders severance agreement.

(vi) _Unvested Performance Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is neither a Vested Company Unit nor an Assumed Unit (each, an "
_Unvested Company Performance Unit_ ") shall be converted into an unvested
award (" _Converted Performance Unit_ ") representing the right to receive a
stock unit in Parent Class A Common Stock calculated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 3.6(d)(iv)_. Each Converted Performance Unit
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to
vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective Unvested Company
Performance Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all
performance-vesting criteria applicable to performance periods ending after
the Companys fiscal year 2017 are deemed to be achieved at target levels as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Converted Performance Unit tranche with a performance period concluding on or
before the end of the Companys fiscal year 2017 shall vest only to the extent
that either the applicable performance criteria are achieved or such Converted
Performance Unit accelerates pursuant to the holders severance agreement, if
applicable.

(vii) _Annual Incentive Plan Awards._ If any Annual Incentive Awards (as
defined herein) have not been finally determined and settled prior to the
Expiration Date, at the Effective Time, each of the 2017 Management Incentive
Plan, Key Incentive Plan and Profit-Sharing Incentive Plan awards that is

 agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other Taxes required by reason

Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Law and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

surrendered Certificates in compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for issuance or payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.6(b)_. Any portion of the Payment Fund previously delivered to Parent

applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration that is issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and/or the
Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may deem
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

3.8 _Taking of Necessary Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease and operate
the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to conduct its
business as it is currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character or location of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the failure

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) The Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, each as
amended to date, are in full force and effect, and neither the Company Board
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Company Stockholder that
beneficially owns more than 5% of the Company Shares, has taken any action to

accurate copy of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company
Bylaws, along with the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, and
performance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly approved by the Company
Board. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding Company Shares is the only vote of the holders of any class or

would have been necessary under applicable Law and the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to adopt, approve or authorize this Agreement and

interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) unanimously
approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) unanimously resolved to make the Company Board
Recommendation.

the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) or
the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby. No other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies to or purports
to apply to the Offer, the Merger, the Support Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

Company, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except

Certification of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or any Company
Subsidiary Documents, (ii) assuming receipt of the government approvals

affected, or (iv) give rise to or result in any person having, or having the
right to exercise, any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, rights to
acquire or similar rights with respect to any capital stock of the Company or

employees in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Schedule 14D-9.

Commitment Letter, and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ hereof and compliance by
the Company with their covenants hereunder (except, in the case of clause

of the date of this Agreement, of the fully executed debt commitment
letter(s) from the Financing Sources identified therein, together with any
executed fee letters related thereto (of which only the fee amounts, price
caps and economic "flex" terms have been redacted; _provided_ , that,

-59- CONFIDENTIAL



 

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior

Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event
if and only if either:

 

(i) (A) the Company has received an unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized
standing and its outside counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise out of a material breach or
violation of any provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ by the Company and the Person
from whom the Company received such Acquisition Proposal has not made any
other Acquisition Proposals (either alone or together with one or more other
Persons) to the Company that resulted from or arose out of a material breach
or violation of any provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _
7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, or _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ by the Company, (C) the
Company has not materially breached or violated any of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, or _Section_

alone or together with one or more other Persons), (D) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall have given Parent at
least five (5) business days prior written notice of the intent to take such
action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change), which notice shall attach such Superior Proposal, the
definitive agreement with respect thereto and state expressly the identity of
the Person making such Superior Proposal and a summary of all the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal in reasonable detail, to the
extent not included in the definitive agreement (the " _Pre-Recommendation
Change Notice_"), and shall give Parent the opportunity to meet and discuss in
good faith potential amendments or other modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that the Offer, the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be effected, (E) Parent shall
not have made, within the foregoing five (5) business days after receipt of
the Pre-Recommendation Change Notice, a counteroffer or proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel) is
at least as favorable to its stockholders as such Superior Proposal, and (F)
after such discussions, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and after considering in good
faith any counteroffer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to the immediately
preceding clause (E)) that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law (it being agreed that every subsequent
revision or modification to price or consideration of any other material
revision or material modification to any such Superior Proposal shall require
a new written notice thereof by the party proposing to take such action to
the other party, as the case may be, pursuant to the preceding clause (D) and
a new five (5) business day "matching" period under the preceding clauses (D)
and (E) following the initial five (5) business day "matching" period); or

(ii) in response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date
of this Agreement, if: (A) the Intervening Event does not involve the receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal, offer, or transaction from
any third party relating to or in connection with a transaction of the nature
described in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" (which, for the
purposes of this clause (A), shall be read without reference to the percentage
thresholds set forth in the definition thereof); and (B) (1) prior to
effecting the Company Board Recommendation Change the Company shall have
given Parent at least five (5) business days notice of the intent to consider
such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and discuss in good faith
the purported basis for the proposed Company Board Recommendation Change,
Parents reaction thereto and potential amendments and modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in response thereto so that the Offer
and the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
effected, and (2) after such discussions, the Company Board determines in good

 



-60- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that any Company Board
Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction may be
made solely and exclusively pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i)
only, and may not be made pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (ii),
and any Company Board Recommendation Change may only be made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ and no other provisions of this Agreement.

 

The Company shall keep confidential any counter-offers or proposals made by
Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, other than to the extent
required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports or under applicable Law or stock
exchange listing requirement.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or disclosing a "stop, look and listen" of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Company (with respect to statements made by the
Company Board) pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act, shall not make disclosures that would amount to a
Company Board Recommendation Change, other than pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.4(b)_, and (ii) any statements or disclosures regarding this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or about any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal) or Acquisition Transaction shall constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change, unless such statement or disclosure is accompanied by
an express, unequivocal affirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.

under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the

conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that such
other terms would not reasonably be expected to delay or hinder the Acceptance
Time or adversely impact the ability of Parent to obtain the proceeds of the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing Date), (iv) satisfy (or seek waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in the Debt
Commitment Letter (or definitive agreements entered into with respect to the
Debt Commitment Letter), (v) prepare the information memoranda, preliminary

the event that all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter have been
satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the
Closing; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent shall not be required to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt
Financing in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) through (vi), and shall
not be required to enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto, if
the cash or other sources of immediately available funds Parent has or will
have prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, cash and cash
equivalents (including short-term marketable securities) of the Company and
the net proceeds of any Substitute Financing) are in an amount sufficient to
enable it to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and to pay any related fees and expenses.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letter (other than
pursuant to "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) without
the consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on
the Closing Date (unless Parent has a sufficient

 



-63- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 amount of available cash on hand from other sources, including, without
limitation, cash and cash equivalents (including short-term marketable
securities) of the Company, to make the representation set forth in _Section
5.6(a)_ ), (ii) impose new or additional conditions to, or expand any of the
conditions to, the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to delay, impede or prevent the timely funding of the
Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Financing Sources, or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent
to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, _provided_ ,

amend and restate or replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, subject
to the conditions set forth in (i) through (iv) above. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the option of
Parent by instruments that either amend, amend and restate, or replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letter on economic terms that are no less favorable
in any material respect to Parent than the terms under the existing Debt
Commitment Letter (a " _Substitute Financing_ "); _provided_ that the terms of
any such Substitute Financing shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date (unless Parent has a
sufficient amount of available cash on hand from other sources, including,
without limitation, cash and cash equivalents (including short-term
marketable securities and the proceeds of any such Substitute Financing) of
the Company, to make the representation set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ ) (ii)
impose new or additional conditions to the availability of the Substitute
Financing at the Closing or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Substitute Financing at Closing, (iii) impose any other terms
that could reasonably be expected to delay, impede or prevent the timely
funding of such Substitute Financing at or prior to the Closing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Substitute Financing, or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Financing Sources providing such Substitute Financing, in each case, as
compared to the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of
any amendments, restatements, supplements, amendment and restatements,
modifications or replacements to the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) give the
Company prompt notice of any breach or material dispute or disagreement by any
party of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware or any
termination thereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent be under any
obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) that,
on the advice of outside counsel, would waive the protection of attorney-
client or similar privilege if such party shall have used reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege. " _Financing Sources_ " means the agents, arrangers, lenders and
other entities that have committed to provide or arrange all or any part of
the Debt Financing or other financings, including any Substitute Financing, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties to
any joinder agreements, indentures or credit agreements entered pursuant
thereto or relating thereto (but excluding Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries), together with their respective Affiliates, and their respective
Affiliates officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and
their respective successors and assigns.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
prior to the Closing Date or is otherwise not obtained by the Closing Date on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including
the flex provisions) and such portion is required to consummate the Merger,
(1) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (2) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain any such portion from
alternative sources of Substitute Financing as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, in the event that any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions) and such portion
is required to consummate the Merger, the Debt Commitment Letter may be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the
option of Parent after the date of this

 



-64- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 Agreement but prior to the Closing Date by instruments that either amend,
amend and restate, or replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter or
contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other or
additional parties; _provided_ that the terms of any such new or amended
commitment letters shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded on the Closing Date (unless Parent has a sufficient
amount of available cash on hand from other sources to make the representation
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_), (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise expand
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in a manner that
could reasonably be expected to delay, impede or prevent the timely funding of
the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, or the satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources and otherwise
complies with the restrictions on a Substitute Financing set forth in
_Section 8.3(b)_. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and correct copies
of all new or amended commitment letters (including redacted fee and
engagement letters in respect of any new or amended commitment letters). In
such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed
to include the new or amended commitment letters described in this _Section_
__ _ 8.3_ to the extent then in effect and the term "Debt Financing" as used
herein shall be deemed to include the financing contemplated by any such new
or amended debt commitment letters. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees that neither the obtaining of Debt Financing or any alternative
financing is a condition to Closing and consummation of the Offer.

8.4 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to provide such cooperation in connection with any
financing (including, without limitation, the Debt Financing and any
Substitute Financing) by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger as may be reasonably requested by Parent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to: (i) furnish Parent and the
Financing Sources with the Required Information and all other financial and
other pertinent information and disclosures regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Financing Sources for use
in connection with any financing, (ii) if the Parent pursues a
Substitute Financing, participate at reasonable times in a reasonable number
of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions (including sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating
agencies), (iii) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, confidential information memoranda, offering documents, private
placement memoranda and other similar documents including road show or
investor meeting slides in connection with any financing (including
requesting customary consents of accountants for use of their reports in any

require (i) any officer, counsel or Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other
action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ or any other provision of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that

Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to personnel, properties, facilities, contracts,
books, records and other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to inform the Chief Financial Officer of Parent at least
one business day prior to the Closing of any liabilities of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as to which the Chief Financial Officer of the Company has
actual knowledge and that, individually, would reasonably be expected to
exceed $350,000 that were incurred (or as to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries became liable) outside the ordinary course of business and that
were not otherwise set forth in the Company SEC Reports or the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

to Parent and its Representatives a copy of each report, schedule, proxy or
information statement, registration statement and other document to be filed
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities

such disclosure is provided for in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_.

 

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ X_ and the Effective
Time, (i) the Company shall promptly notify Parent upon becoming aware of any
inaccuracy or breach of any agreement, covenant, representation, or warranty
of the Company contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would
cause or would reasonably be expected to cause the condition in clauses (2)(b)
or (2)(c) of _Annex_ __ _ A_ to fail to be satisfied at such time (as if the
Acceptance Time were to occur at such time) and (ii) Parent shall promptly
notify the Company upon becoming aware of any inaccuracy or breach of any
agreement, covenant, representation, or warranty of Parent or Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or breach would cause or
would reasonably be expected to cause a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
such notice shall be deemed to

 



-67- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter for the purpose of
determining whether any of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied.

 

(d) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ X_ and the Effective
Time, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (i) any notice or other communication received by it from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication received by such party or any of their respective Subsidiaries
from any Person, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) any material written notice or
written communication from any Governmental Authority indicating that a
Company Permit is revoked or about to be revoked, which revocation or failure
to obtain has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

(e) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_ and the Effective Time the
Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
Representatives by any of its current or former stockholders (on their own
behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and
shall consider Parents views with respect to such stockholder litigation. The
Company shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior
written consent of Parent.

of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ X_ and the Effective

disclosure of information subject to attorney-client privilege of Parent or
Merger Sub.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
8.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to, or to
disclose information, where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
Law, fiduciary duty or Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no
information obtained pursuant to the access granted or notification provided
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall be deemed to (i) amend or
otherwise modify in any respect any representation or warranty of the party
providing such access or notice, (ii) impair or otherwise prejudice in any
manner rights of the party receiving such access or notice to rely upon the
conditions to the obligations of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this

 



-68- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 Agreement, or (iii) impair or otherwise limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such access or notice.

 

(i) All information acquired pursuant to the access granted or notice provided
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2016, between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in
full force and effect from and after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

8.6 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
the other party hereto before issuing any press release or making any public
announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ ,  _however,_ that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement as may be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, or in connection with a Company Board Recommendation
Change, if it first notifies and consults with the other party hereto prior to
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement or
statement.

 

8.7 _Employee Plans_.

(a)  _401(k) Plan_. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable,
shall take all necessary actions to terminate (i) any and all group severance,
separation, deferred compensation, or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements (but excluding (A) plans, programs or arrangements required by
Law and (B) agreements entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and individual employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, providing for severance or other employment benefits) and (ii)
the Company 401(k) Plan (collectively, the " _Company Terminating Plans_ "),
in each case, effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date
and contingent upon the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. The Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of any resolutions or other corporate action
(the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) evidencing that the Company Terminating Plans will be terminated
effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, contingent
upon the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. The Company shall also
take such other actions in further of terminating such Company Terminating
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require.

 

(b) _Ongoing Employment Terms_. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the relevant
Continuing Employee), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide
base salary of no less than the base salary provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such base salary may be reduced in connection with a reduction of base
salaries generally applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries. 

(c) _Pre-Existing Conditions; Service Credit; Etc_. From and after the
Effective Time, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall,

policies (including vacation and severance, but excluding the sabbatical
program) of Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time for purposes
of eligibility and vesting

 



-69- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 and determination of level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to, (i) cause any
pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to
the extent that such waiting periods would be inapplicable, taking into
account service with the Company) under any group health plans of Parent or
its affiliates to be waived with respect to employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents, and (ii) provide each employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries with credit for any deductibles, coinsurance,
copay, or other out of pocket expenses paid under any Company Employee Plan
that provides medical, prescription dental or vision benefits in the plan year
in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible,
coinsurance, copay or out of pocket requirements under any medical,
prescription dental or vision plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time to
the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the comparable
Company Employee Plan.

(d) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_
are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, and the parties hereby expressly disclaim the
creation or establishment of any third party beneficiary rights (whether
express or implied) under or by right of the terms of this _Section_ __ _
8.7_. Nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Parent Employee Plan to
reflect the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_.

 

(e) _Rule 14d-10 Resolutions_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, at a meeting duly
called and held at which all members of the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") were present, the
Compensation Committee will unanimously (a) approve as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act, (i) each Company Stock
Plan, (ii) the treatment of Company Stock Awards, Company Restricted Stock
Units, Company Performance Stock Units, Company Performance Stock Options and
Annual Incentive Awards in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement, the applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable Company
Employee Plan, and (iii) each Company Employee Plan that under the terms of
this Agreement is required to be set forth in _Sections 4.15(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and (b) take all other actions necessary to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing arrangements. The Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions (the form and substance
of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, with such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) reflecting any
approvals and actions referred to in the preceding sentence. 

8.8 _Section 280G_.

 

(a) At the request of Parent, and within ten (10) business days following the
date of any such request, the Company will provide or make available to
Parent a report detailing the possible tax consequences of Section 280G of the
Code for any current or former employee, officer, director or individual
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary who is reasonably
likely to be a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), which will be prepared by, Alvarez and Marsal Holdings, LLC, BDO
USA, LLP or another nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

(b) To the extent any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code) will or may receive severance or other benefits that could
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
will use reasonable best efforts to, subject to the affected individuals
consent,

 



-70- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 amend any Company Employee Plan with any such disqualified individual to
provide that in the event the severance and other benefits payable to such
individual (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such individuals
benefits will be either: (a) delivered in full, or (b) delivered to such
lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject
to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing
amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income
taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the
receipt by the individual on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of
benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be
taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.

8.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement that have
been disclosed to Parent between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect except as and to the extent required by applicable
Law.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the existing policy of the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance (the " _D andO Policy_") covering claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such acts or omissions are
covered by the DandO Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party who is covered
as of the Effective Time by the DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on the date
hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual
premium is set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter) for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
"), _provided_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 8.9(b)_, Parent or the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous, in the
aggregate, than the DandO Policy, and in the event that Parent shall purchase
such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ for so long as such
"tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 



-71- CONFIDENTIAL



 

(c) The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _
8.9(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any
and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns)
shall consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or transfers at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any
other person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.9_.

8.10 _Annual Report_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file
the 2017 10-K on or prior to May 26, 2017. If the Expiration Date has not
occurred on or prior to June 1, 2017, then the Company shall file the 2017
10-K with the SEC prior to the Expiration Date.

8.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant such
approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that the Offer, the
Merger and/or such other transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise take
such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and
any regulations promulgated thereunder, on the Merger and such
other transactions.

8.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

agreements set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ are an integral part of

Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner
the amounts due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent shall make a claim that results in a judgment against the
Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses

efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and
(ii) without limiting _Section_ __ _ 10.3(c)_, but subject to _Section_ __ _
10.2(b)_, Parent and Merger Sub, upon receipt of the Termination Fee Amount
by Parent shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action
or proceeding against any party to this Agreement or any other Person arising

rights hereunder (a) from and after the Effective Time, to any Financing
Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of
the Debt Financing, or (b) to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 11.4_ shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

 

11.5 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken by their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Sections_ __ _ 11.6_, _11.8_ , _11.10_ , _11.12_
, _11.13_ , _11.14_ , _11.15_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ (and any
provision (including any defined term therein) of this Agreement to the

parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained

-78- CONFIDENTIAL



 

 if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or
parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

11.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

11.8 _Financing Source Liability_. No Financing Source shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto or for any
claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by

representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the
Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Affiliates stockholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees,
controlling persons, agents and representatives (each, a " _Company Related
Party_ "), and the Company agrees not to and to cause its Company Related
Parties not to, (i) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Financing Source or (ii) seek to enforce the commitment against,
make any claims for breach of the Debt Commitment Letter against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for
any reason, including in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or the
obligations of Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
11.8_ shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of
the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to each other or in connection
therewith.

11.9 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

11.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 

11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except as follows: (a) the Indemnified Parties intended to be third
party beneficiaries of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.9_, who shall have
the right to enforce such provisions directly; and (b) the Financing Sources
are intended to be third

_11.8_ , _11.10_ , _11.13_ , _11.14_ , _11.15_ and this  _Section_ __ _
11.12_.

11.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflict of law provisions thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
without limiting anything set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, each party
hereto agrees that any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources relating to
the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
New York (except as expressly specified in the Debt Commitment Letter, the
commitment relating to any alternative financing or in any definitive document
related to such financing).

 

11.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in

matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives
and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such jurisdiction, venue and process. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything herein to the contrary, without limiting anything set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.8_, each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that any action
of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated thereby shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (b) not to bring or permit any
of its affiliates or representatives to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such action in any other court, (c) that a final judgment in any
such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law, (d) that the laws
described in the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ shall govern any
such action and (e) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court. Each party hereto hereby
agrees not to commence any legal proceedings relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any jurisdiction or
courts other than as provided herein.

 

11.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT FOR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER.

 

11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to
bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
