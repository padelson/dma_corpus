at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and

and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 _2.5_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in _ Exhibit A_ attached hereto and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and
such certificate of incorporation (subject to _ Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_).

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect

6.10(a)_).

 

 _2.6_ _Directors and Officers_.

_2.7_ _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the securities described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the following
will occur:

 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and
thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of
common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or
Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.00, without
interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.11_); and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will
automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change
with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), any shares of
the Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Owned Company Shares) and that are held by
any holder of such shares of Company Common Stock who has not voted in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who has complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such
shares of Company Common Stock held by any such holder (the "Dissenting
Company Shares") will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and holders of such Dissenting
Company Shares will be entitled to receive payment

 



-19- 

    

 of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses their rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Company
Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Per Share Price for such
Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Company Shares will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL
and as provided in the previous sentence.

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any actual or, if in
writing, threatened demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock and (ii) the right to direct, in consultation with the
Company, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any written demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands.

_2.8 Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time each Company Restricted
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become
a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per
Share Price (the "Company Restricted Share Consideration").

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Per Share Price
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option);
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each Company Option with an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than the Per Share Price will be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

(c) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Per Share Price;
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU (the "RSU Consideration"). 

(d) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time each Company PSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Per Share
Price; multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU, with any performance-based vesting conditions
deemed achieved at target-level performance (except as set forth in Section
2.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the "PSU Consideration").

 



-20- 

    

(e) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited or maintained) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (if applicable), the aggregate (i) Company
Restricted Share Consideration owed to all holders of Company Restricted
Shares; (ii) Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options;
(iii) RSU Consideration owed to all holders of Company RSUs; and (iv) PSU
Consideration owed to all holders of Company PSUs. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company Equity Awards
will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through
its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of Company Equity Awards that are cancelled and
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_, as applicable, net of any
required withholding of Taxes; _provided_ , that if any payment owed to a
holder of Company Equity Awards pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(d)_,
as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Corporation will, (i) by wire transfer or direct deposit, or (ii) by
a check sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the
Closing Date (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter),
provide such payment owed to such holder, net of any required withholding of
Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such amounts relate to
a Company RSU or Company PSU that is nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such
amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable
agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company RSU or Company PSU
that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(f) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary
to effect the cancellation of the Company Equity Awards upon the Effective
Time and to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

_2.9_ _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and
(ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. 

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) become entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 



-21- 

    

 Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully
guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no
more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund").
To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of
the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the Payment
Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ for any
reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that
the Payment Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and
maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any income from investment of the
Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
the payment to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares) of
one or more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)) (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares) (the "Uncertificated Shares") will be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order
to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ with respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu
thereof, such record holder, upon receipt of an "agents message" by
the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment
Agent may reasonably request), will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share Price, and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of 

 



-22- 

    

 holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and transfer of Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_. Until so surrendered or
transferred, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the
Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent shall transmit
to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares)
held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by
Parent) upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their
successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled
thereto. 

 



-23- 

    

_2.10_ _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, or in the case of Dissenting
Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_. The Per Share
Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there
will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article_ __ _ II_. 

_2.11_ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

 _2.12 Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation (each a "Withholding Agent") will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Equity Awards, such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

With respect to any Section of this _Article_ __ _ III_, except (a) as
disclosed in the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company
with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case pursuant to
the Exchange Act on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than any predictive or cautionary disclosures contained or
referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any non-public materials) (the "Recent SEC
Reports"); and (b) other than for the representations set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and _Section_ __ _
3.8_, subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, as set forth in the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on
the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



-24- 

    

_3.1_ _Organization_ _; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL.
The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its
properties, rights and assets, except where the failure to have such power or
authority has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of its Organizational Documents, each as amended to the
date hereof. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its
Organizational Documents in any material respect.

_3.2 _ _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b)
perform its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally;
and (B) is subject to general principles of equity.

 

 _3.3 Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. At a meeting called and held prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company Board has unanimously
(i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Company
Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other
obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders adopt this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (collectively,
the "Company Board Recommendation").

 



-25- 

    

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received the written opinion (or
an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor, Piper
Jaffray and Co. (the "Financial Advisor"), to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be offered to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) in the Merger is fair from a financial point of
view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such written
opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and any committee thereof and
may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub). The Company shall have
provided to Parent a copy of such written opinion for informational purposes
only promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ are true and correct, the Company
Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to the Merger and/or the
Voting Agreement.

 

 _3.4 Brokers_. Except for the Financial Advisor (a copy of whose engagement
letter has been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof redacted for
terms other than fee amounts or surviving liabilities), there is no financial
advisor, investment banker, broker, finder, agent or other similar Person that
has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisors, investment
banking, brokerage, finders or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Merger.

 

 _3.5 Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
on the Merger (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock that is necessary pursuant to
applicable Law and the Companys Organizational Documents to consummate the
Merger.

_3.6 Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the

action described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), a "Company Board
Recommendation Change"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of (1) a "stop,

Approval:

(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not effect
such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice
shall specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change,

relating to such Intervening Event;

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, during such
five (5) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requested to do so)
to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the
need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event; and

 



-50- 

    

(3) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel and taking into account Parents proposed revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters and any
other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure
of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that each time material modifications to the
Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification
and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and
be extended for three (3) Business Days from the day of such notification; or

(ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited, written _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Superior Proposal; and/or (B) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_; and/or (C) cause the Company to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement;

failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Superior Proposal;
and

 

(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent five (5) Business

been withdrawn; (B) has concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) has resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)_ and
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will
identify the Person or Group making such Superior Proposal and include the
material terms thereof and copies of all relevant agreements relating to such
Superior Proposal; and during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
has requested to do so) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner
that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change;
and

 



-51- 

    

(4) following such Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and
taking into account Parents proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Financing Letters and any other information provided by
Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that
each time material modifications to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal
determined to be a Superior Proposal are made (it being understood that any
improvement to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material
modification), the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the
time period set forth in the preceding clause (3) shall recommence and be
extended for three (3) Business Days from the day of such notification.

proposals that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (i) the identity of the Person or Group making such Inquiries, offers
or proposals; (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Inquiries, offers or proposals; and (iii) copies of any written materials
relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives. Thereafter,
the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis of the
status and terms of any such Inquiries, offers or proposals (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, references to "Inquiries" shall
be limited to Inquiries that are made known to an executive officer of the
Company or director of the Company Board.

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit
the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule

that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(g) _Conditional Commitment_. If the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
has resolved to make a Company Board Recommendation Change and provide a
notice thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)(3)_ with respect to a
Superior Proposal, in order to enable the Company Board (or committee
thereof) to be sufficiently comfortable that such Superior Proposal will
remain available to the Company when and if this Agreement is terminated as
and to the extent permitted hereunder in respect of such Superior Proposal,
the Company may enter into a binding

 



-52- 

    

 letter agreement (the "Conditional Commitment") with the third party making
such Superior Proposal (the "Committed Bidder"), which Conditional Commitment
may (i) provide that the Committed Bidder is obligated, on behalf of the
Company, to pay the Company Termination Fee and any other fee or expense
required to be paid by the Company pursuant to the relevant provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) attach as an exhibit
thereto a fully negotiated agreement and plan of merger providing for the
transaction contemplated by the Superior Proposal and/or (iii) provide that
the Company shall enter into such agreement and plan of merger, and/or that
such agreement and plan of merger shall automatically become binding on the
Company, only on and after (and in no event before) both (A) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) the payment by the
Company (or by the Committed Bidder on behalf of the Company) of the Company
Termination Fee or any other fee or expense required to be paid hereunder;

except as contemplated above or (y) impose on Parent or any Parent Related
Parties any liability or obligation at any time, including following the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties
further agree that, in the circumstances described in the immediately
preceding sentence, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, (1) in no event may the Conditional Commitment permit the
Committed Bidder to make any SEC or other regulatory filings in connection
with the transactions contemplated by Conditional Commitment until the
termination of this Agreement unless otherwise required by Law and (2) the
Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this
Agreement applicable thereto.

all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or
advisable pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including by:

(i) causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ to

-53-

Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article

foregoing, if and to the extent advisable and necessary to obtain the

Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or

to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub to use, and cause each of their respective
controlled Affiliates to take any and all steps

 



-55- 

    

 necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby prior to
the Termination Date; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall not be obligated to take or agree to take any action with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries the effectiveness of which is not conditioned on
the Closing occurring.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective

to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Laws, keep the other parties
apprised of the content and status of any material communications with or from
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, including (i) promptly
notify the Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of
(or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of)
any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other parties to review
and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the

notifications, filing, submission or other material written communication (and
any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the Parties reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental

the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting or substantive
discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. Parent and Merger Sub will not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, extend or offer or agree to extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. However, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such information
shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other Party without approval of the party providing the
non-public information; _provided_ , __ that each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub may redact such information as necessary to (i) remove any
valuation and related information, or (ii) address any contractual
arrangements or reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns before sharing any information provided to
any Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only
basis.

 



-56-

date hereof and the Closing, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
controlled Affiliates to, enter into or consummate any Contracts or
arrangements for an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
purchase of assets, license or otherwise) of any ownership interest, assets
or rights of any other Person if such ownership interest, assets or rights
would reasonably be expected (including the termination or expiration of the
waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law) to result
in any material delay in obtaining, or to result in the failure to obtain, any
regulatory approvals required in connection with the Merger, or which would
otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Merger in any
material respect.

_6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practical following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within 30 days after the date of this Agreement
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company), the Company
(with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably
requested by the Company) shall prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy
Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the Company
(with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably
requested by the Company) shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without
providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its counsel. On the date
of mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders and at the time
of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall ensure that neither the
Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing.

 

(c) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information concerning
it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered
by the Company, on the one hand,

 



-57- 

    

 or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information shall be
promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to
the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated
to the Company Stockholders.

(d) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be,
without providing the other, to the extent practicable, a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such written communication and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel.

(e) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its
staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case
may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith. The Company will respond to
any comments received from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in
no case later than ten (10) Business Days) after its receipt thereof,
including by filing any required amendments to the Proxy Statement.

(f) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and in any event within
seven (7) Business Days of the first to occur of (x) ten (10) calendar days
following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement if the SEC has not
informed the Company that it will review the Proxy Statement, or (y) the date
the SEC confirms that it has completed its review of the Proxy Statement, as
the case may be, and shall take all necessary actions to set a record date
promptly (including conducting broker searches and setting a preliminary
record date) to accommodate such a mailing date.

_6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL, the Companys Organizational Documents and the rules and regulations of
the NASDAQ to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 25 Business Days
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company), following

 



-58- 

    

 the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. In the event that the
Company Board makes a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company will
nevertheless submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall permit Parent and its Representatives
to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Approval; (ii) if there are holders of an insufficient shares of the Company
Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder
Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting (it being
understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than twenty (20) Business
Days in the aggregate pursuant to clause (i) or this clause (ii) without the
prior written consent of Parent); (iii) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a request from
the SEC or its staff or (iv) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to give the Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company
has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the
Company Stockholders.

_6.5 _ _Financing_.

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
termination, replacement, amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letters if
such amendment, replacement, modification or waiver would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing,
including by changing the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue
discount of the Financing, unless the aggregate amount of the Financing,
together with other financial resources available to Parent, is sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the
Financing that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
timely consummation of the Financing or the Closing; (iii) materially
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other Parties to the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto; or (iv) prevent, impede or
materially delay the timely consummation of the Financing or the Closing. Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Letters as amended, replaced or modified;
and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment Letters" or "Financing
Letters" will include such documents as amended, replaced or modified. Parent
will not release or consent to the termination of any individual lender under
the Debt Commitment Letters, except for (a) adding additional arrangers or
agents under the Debt Commitment Letters (and reallocating the commitments of
the Debt Financing Sources thereunder in connection with such addition); or
(b) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing
commitments as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ or as required by
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_.

 



-59- 

    

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any flex provisions) described in the Financing
Letters and any related Fee Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee
Letter; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and such
definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter; and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including causing the
Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub
will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees
arising pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when they become due.

 

(c) _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed on a current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing; and (ii) provide the Company with copies of executed definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub must give the Company prompt notice of
any breach or default by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Parent must provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances
referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in
any event with two (2) Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers
a written request therefor to Parent.

 

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event (and in any event no later than the date on which the Marketing
Period expires), to (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms not materially worse and conditions not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters and the related Fee Letter and in an amount at least equal
to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be
(the "Alternate Debt Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New
Debt Commitment Letters"), which new letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of
any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith)
to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are
obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters"
will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

 



-60- 

    

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_, if the Financing has not been obtained, Parent
and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_, to consummate
the Merger.

_6.6 Financing Cooperation_. 

(a) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
respective reasonable best efforts, in each case at Parents sole expense, to
provide Parent with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
customary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including
using reasonable best efforts in connection with:

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
bank meetings and sessions with rating agencies at mutually agreeable times
in mutually agreeable locations upon reasonable advance notice ( _provided_
that only one such ratings agency meetings and one such bank meeting or other

Pro Forma Financial Statements, subject in all respects to _Section_ __ _
6.6(b)(viii)_ below (including commercially reasonable assistance with

respect of the Company and solely as required to be delivered at Closing
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, it being
understood that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

(iv) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with (x) the reports and

Statements") (all such information and documents described in the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)(iv)_, the
"Required Financing Information") reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_
, that with respect to the information described in clause (x) above, the
furnishing of such information on EDGAR or the website of the Company shall
constitute delivery thereof;

(v) facilitating the obtaining and delivering customary pay-off letters
in respect of the Credit Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date; and

(vi) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources at least three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing with all documentation and other information

Business Days prior to Closing.

 

(b) _Obligations of the_ _Company_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ will
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses for
which it has not received prior reimbursement; (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement; (iii) give any indemnities; (iv) take any action that, in the good

result in a contravention of, violation or breach of, or default under, the

Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such

 _6.10 Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor and fulfill the obligations of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements listed on _Section_ __
_ 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter between the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the "Indemnified
Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement.
During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements listed on
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement,
each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, penalties,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to
(i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ii) any
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary or

 



-65- 

    

 Affiliate (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time; and (iii) the
Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
with respect thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the
Surviving Corporation shall advance all fees and expenses (including fees and
expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense
of such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle or otherwise compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the
fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor
policies of an insurance company the terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors
and officers than the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof or
(ii) request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage
under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with
respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does
not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases such a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for
so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect in lieu of the
maintenance of the DandO Insurance.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or at least one of their respective successors or
assigns shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, if such assumption shall
not otherwise occur by operation of law.

 

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_
__ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
Persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Companys Organizational Documents; (ii) the
Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and
all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).

 

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

_6.11 Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective

otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation and its

base salary or wages that are no less favorable than such Continuing
Employees base salary or wages immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) annual
target cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than such
Continuing Employees annual target cash incentive opportunities in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those that would have been provided by the Company to such
Continuing Employee as of the Closing as set forth on _Section_ __ _
6.11(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iv) employee benefits that are
either (x) substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (y) no less favorable
than those provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that an Employee Plan is made available to any
Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation or paid time-off accrual and severance pay entitlement),
except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits or for purposes of any defined
benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all employee benefit or compensation plans sponsored by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Employee Plans)
(such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such
New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extents such
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Old Plan, and the
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee.

 



-68- 

    

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of

amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii)

consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except that no consent shall be required for any such
filing, release or announcement required by applicable Law, regulation or
stock exchange rule or listing agreement if the applicable party has provided
a right to review such filing, release or announcement in advance (to the
extent permissible), and (ii) the Company (other than with respect to the
portion of any communication relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Company
Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or
other similar Persons; (c) providing any statements that are public or are

instrument, or to incur any liability that is not conditioned upon or that

with their cooperation in arranging a Carveout Transaction pursuant to this
Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, (i) the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ shall solely
govern the Companys obligations in respect of any Carveout Transaction, (ii)
the success, failure or progression of a Carveout Transaction to materialize

or disclosed and not withdrawn or has otherwise become known to the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) and not withdrawn in each case prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting or the event giving rise to such right of
termination, respectively; and (C) within twelve (12) months following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to either such provision, either
an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition

funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, all references to "20%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "40%".

 



-76- 

    

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent if one has been so
designated by Parent following request therefor (or if not so designated, as
promptly as possible thereafter such designation).

 

(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_, then the Company must substantially concurrently with such
termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts

Parent following request therefor (or if not so designated, as promptly as
possible thereafter such designation).

(iv) _Parent Expenses_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee(s)) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants
to Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or their respect Affiliates (and all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Financing Sources for which Parent, Merger
Sub, the Guarantor or their respective Affiliates may be responsible)
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or their respective Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Parent Expenses"), in an amount not greater than $2,000,000, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days following
such termination to an account designated in writing by Parent if one has been
so designated by Parent following request therefor (or if not so

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
will the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or
the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, on more than one occasion, whether

applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.

 



-77- 

    

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger and that
each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company and the Company Related Parties or Parent and the
Parent Related Parties, as applicable, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent, on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that seeks to obtain payment
of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses or Parent Termination Fee,
as applicable, the non-prevailing party shall pay the prevailing party
its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount
or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or
portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or
portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

(f) _Sole Remedy_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_
or for any other reason, the Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee
to the extent owed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ (including the

right to seek specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ will be
the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company and the Company Related
Parties against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing Sources; and (B) the
former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited
partners, stockholders and successors, heirs and assignees of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Financing Sources (collectively, the "Parent Related

herewith (including the Financing Letters and the Guarantee) and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon payment of
such amounts (which recourse shall be sought solely against Parent and
subject to the limitations set forth herein, or the Guarantor or the Equity
Investors (as applicable) in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
set forth in, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee), (1) none of
the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
the Company or the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith (including the
Financing Letters and the Guarantee) or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including with respect to any matters relating to CERCLA or any
other Environmental Law) (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will
remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, the

or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the failure of the Closing to be consummated or the Financing
Letters and the financings contemplated therein, including the Debt Financing
and the financing

 



-78- 

    

 of the Equity Financing (and the abandonment or termination thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_ will not
relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor from liability (1) for any Willful
and Material Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any breaches of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that, under no circumstances will the
collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates (including the Guarantor) for breaches under this Agreement, the
Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to
$15,520,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations and any obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ in the aggregate for all such breaches (taking into
account, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, the Reimbursement Obligations and/or any obligations under  _Section_ __
_ 8.3(e)_) and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party
seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amounts. Other than the
remedies described in the foregoing sentence, no Parent Related Party shall
have any further liability or obligation, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate (or limited liability company or limited
partnership) veil, by or through a claim against the Guarantor, any other
Parent Related Party and the Company covenants and agrees that it shall not
institute, and shall cause its Representatives, Affiliates and other Company

under circumstances in which Parent is entitled to the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or the Parent Expenses owed pursuant
to Section 8.3(b)(iv), Parents (or its designees) receipt of the Company
Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses and Parents right to specific
performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Related Parties against (A) the
Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B)
the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement,
any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including with respect to any matters
relating to CERCLA or any other Environmental Law), and upon payment of such
amount (which recourse shall be sought solely against the Company and subject
to the limitations set forth herein), (1) none of the Company Related Parties
will have any further liability or obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement,
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, as applicable) and (2) neither Parent, Merger Sub,
nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against the Company or any other Company Related Party arising
out of, related to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement (or any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the
failure of the Closing to be consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(ii)_ will not relieve the Company from liability
for any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that, under
no circumstances will the collectively monetary damages payable by
the Company for breaches under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to
$15,520,000 plus any obligations under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ in the
aggregate for all breaches (taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, 

 



-79- 

    

 any payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or any obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_). Other than the remedies described in the foregoing
sentence, no Company Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate (or
limited liability company or limited partnership) veil, by or through a claim
against the Company or any Company Related Party, and Parent covenants and
agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Representatives,
Affiliates and other Parent Related Parties not to institute a Legal
Proceeding to seek recourse for such further liability or obligation.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, it is
agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ (but not, following the valid termination of this
Agreement, with respect to sections of this Agreement that do not survive
such termination); _provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled under any
circumstances to both (i) payment of the Parent Termination Fee (or monetary
damages of any kind) and (ii) specific performance of Parents obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing in accordance
with _Article II_.

provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of

Any notice received by e-mail or otherwise at the addressees location on any
Business Day after 5:00 p.m., addressees local time, or on any day that is
not a Business Day will be deemed to have been received at 9:00 a.m.,
addressees local time, on the next Business Day. From time to time, any Party
may provide notice to the other Parties of a change in its address or e-mail
address through a notice given in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_,
except that that notice of any change to the address or any of the other
details specified in or pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ will not be
deemed to have been received until, and will be deemed to have been received
upon, the later of the date (A) specified in such notice; or (B) that is two
(2) Business Days after such notice would otherwise be deemed to have been
received pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

 

 _9.3_ _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law or
otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other Parties, except
that Parent will have the right to assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a)
in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation; or (b) to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interest
herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing,
it being understood that, in each case, such assignment will not (i) affect
the obligations of the parties (including Debt Financing Sources) to the
Financing Letters or Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such
Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment of
this Agreement without the consent required by this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ is
null and void.

_9.4_ _Confidentiality_ _Agreement_. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby acknowledge that _L_ Catterton Management Limited and the
Company have previously executed a confidentiality letter agreement, dated
February 5, 2019 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the Merger
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by and comply with, and to
cause their Representatives to be bound by and comply with, the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.
The standstill provisions of Section 5 of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby waived by the Company with respect to any action taken in connection
with a Carveout Transaction or any other action contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Company waives or amends any
standstill provisions with any third party or enters into any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with any third party with any term of the standstill
provisions (or absence thereof) on terms with respect to standstill provisions
that are more favorable to such third party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall provide notice to Parent thereof
and Section 5 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to have such
term(s) in the Confidentiality Agreement be automatically amended to reflect
any such more favorable term(s). Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives shall be permitted to disclose documents and
information to a Person in connection with a potential Carveout Transaction,
so long as prior to any such disclosure such other Person enters into a
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions (other than
standstill provisions) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 _9.5 Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Guarantee and the Financing Letters, constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be
superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

_9.6_ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.10_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, the Parties agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not,
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as
set forth in or contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_; and (b) from and
after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, and Company Equity Awards to receive the merger consideration
set forth in  _Article_ __ _ II_. The provisions of _Section_ __ _
8.3(f)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, _Section_ __ _
9.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall inure to the benefit
of the Debt Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom
are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Debt
Financing Sources). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent
have any liability or obligation with respect to any payment of monetary
damages in amounts that, in the aggregate, exceed the amounts set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_. 

 



-83- 

    

_9.7_ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

 _9.8_ _Remedies_.

(a)  _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages
(including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and all
or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee).

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A)
the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the
rights and limitations of specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_
are an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the right of the Company to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parents obligation or
the Companys ability, as a third party beneficiary, to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger will be subject to the
requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time Closing is
required to be consummated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_; (B) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to 

 



-84- 

    

 complete the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_; and (D) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation or
the Companys ability, as a third party beneficiary, to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not
been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company, any Company Related
Party or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
the Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.

(iii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided herein
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;
and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
as provided herein to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

 

(c) None of the Debt Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company,
the Company Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at
Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company, the
Company Related Parties or any of their respective Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder.

_9.9_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State
of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Laws (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware; provided, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Financing, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, and enforced under the laws of
the State of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of law
principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the Law
of the State of New York.

_9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guarantee, for and on behalf
of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the
"Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d)
agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement,
the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in
an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f)
agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary and subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(c)_, the
Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding,
whether in Law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the
Debt Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and each
Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at
their respective addresses provided in any applicable Debt Commitment Letter
will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which any of them
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court; (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in
accordance with and enforced under the Laws of the State of New York and (vi)
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

_9.11_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE
CONTRARY, EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS
CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING LETTERS OR THE
FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES).
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.11_.

_9.12 _ _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as
parties hereto and no Company Related Parties and no Parent Related Parties
(other than the Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Guarantee or the
Equity Investors to the extent set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter)
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith. In no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates or
other Company Related Parties, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates or other Parent Related Parties on the
other hand, and each of the Company and Parent agrees not to and to use
commercially reasonably efforts to cause its respective controlled Affiliates
and other Company Related Parties or Parent Related Parties, as applicable,
not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of
this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent
Related Party or Company Related Party, as applicable, not a party to this
Agreement (other than to the extent permitted by, and subject to the
limitations of, the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter).

 

 _9.13_ _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on its face by such disclosure.

 



-87- 

    

_9.14 Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
