to disclose all or any  part of the Confidential Information under the terms
of a subpoena, civil  investigative demand or order issued by a Governmental
Authority; (ii) to  the extent not inconsistent with such request, it

efforts to  take,  or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or

contemplated by this Agreement  as  promptly as practicable, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to  (i)  obtain from Governmental
Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals,  authorizations,
qualifications and orders as are necessary for the consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) promptly make all 
necessary filings (which shall remain the sole responsibility of the Buyer), 
and  thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement  required under the German Act, the Spanish Act, the Brazilian Act,
the  Portuguese Act and the Ukrainian Act and any other applicable antitrust
or  competition law of any Governmental Authority and (iii) have vacated,
lifted,  reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling, judgment,
injunction or other  action (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that is then in effect  and  that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes
illegal or otherwise restricts or  prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing,  each of the Company and the Stockholders shall
permit the Buyer reasonably  to  participate in the defense and settlement
of any claim, suit or cause of action  relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none  of  the Company or the

action without the Buyer\'s written consent. With respect  to antitrust
clearance, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts  to  make,

the  Buyer and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve  objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with  respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
antitrust  or trade or regulatory laws or regulations of any Governmental
Authority and  to  cause the waiting periods or other requirements under the
applicable  anti-competition Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible  date. For purposes hereof, "reasonable best efforts" of the Buyer 
shall include the Buyer's agreement to hold separate and divest such
businesses,  products and assets of the Buyer and its Affiliates as may be
necessary to  obtain the agreement of any Governmental Authority not to seek
an injunction  against or otherwise oppose the transactions contemplated
hereby, on such terms  as may be required by such Governmental Authority. The
Buyer shall  not (and, after Closing, the Buyer shall not permit the Company
and any of  its  Subsidiaries to) consummate another transaction or enter
into an agreement  with  respect to another transaction or take any other
action if the intent or  reasonably anticipated consequence of such
transaction or action is, or would  be, to cause any Governmental Authority
not to grant approval of any required  regulatory approval or materially
delay either such approval.

whatsoever to the Buyer (and the Buyer shall not be entitled  to assert any

contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof. The  Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company 
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of

**SECTION  6.12** **_EMPLOYMENT  MATTERS_**

 

 

**(A)**

 

 

All  Business Employees who remain employees of the Business after the
Closing Date  are referred to as " _Continuing Employees_ ".

 

 

**(B)**

 

 

For  a  period of at least one year following the Closing Date and subject
to their  continued employment, the Buyer shall (or shall cause an Affiliate
of the Buyer  to) provide wages and employee benefits to each Continuing
Employee who is  not an employee of any Subsidiary of the Company organized
in the United States  that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to
those provided to such  Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Continuing Employee\'s terms and
conditions of  employment shall instead be in compliance with applicable law
to the extent  such  law requires different treatment of such Continuing
Employee).

 

 

**(C)**

 

 

For  a  period of at least one year following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall (or  shall cause an Affiliate to) provide wages and employee benefits
to each  Continuing Employee of any Subsidiary of the Company organized in
the United  States that, in the aggregate, are (i) comparable to those
provided to  similarly-situated employees of the Buyer in the United States
or  (ii) substantially comparable to those provided to such Continuing
Employee  immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

**(D)**

 

 

The  Buyer  shall take all actions required so that eligible Continuing
Employees shall  receive credit for purposes of participation and vesting
under any employee  benefit plans, programs or arrangements sponsored by the
Buyer or an Affiliate  of the Buyer to the extent credited under an analogous
plan, program or  arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
as of the Closing  Date. To the extent that the Buyer or an Affiliate of the
Buyer  modifies any coverage or benefit plans under which the Continuing
Employees  participate, the Buyer shall (or shall cause such Affiliate to)
waive any  applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-
at-work  requirements and shall give such Continuing Employees credit under
the new  coverage or benefit plans for deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket  payments that have been paid during the plan year in which the
Closing  occurs.

 

 

**(E)**

 

 

Nothing  in this _Section 6.12_ shall impact the Buyer\'s or any of its
Affiliates\'  rights to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee
or (subject to  _Section 6.12(b) _and _Section 6.12(c)_ ) change the terms 
and conditions of such Continuing Employee\'s employment at any  time.

 

 

**(F)**

 

 

The  Buyer  shall be responsible for any and all notices, liabilities,
costs, payments  and  expenses arising from any action by the Buyer or,
after the Closing, the Company  (including breach of contract, defamation or
retaliatory discharge) regarding  any Business Employee, including any such
liability (i) under any applicable  law  that relates to employees, employee
benefit matters or labor matters, (ii)  for  dismissal, wrongful termination
or constructive dismissal or termination, or  severance pay or other
termination pay, or (iii) under or with respect to any  benefit plan,
program, contract, policy, commitment, or arrangement of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries, including with respect to severance or retention  plans, or to
the extent such severance or retention plans provide payments  or  benefits
with respect to any Business Employee.

 

 

**(G)**

 

 

In  any  termination or layoff of any Business Employee by the Buyer or the
Company  after  the Closing, the Buyer and the Company will comply fully, if
applicable, with  the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 (" _WARN_ ")  and all other applicable Laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and  requiring notice to employees. The Buyer shall not, and
shall cause  the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, at any time prior to 60
days after  the  Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
as those terms are  defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any
facility, site of employment,  operating unit or employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary without complying  fully with the requirements of WARN. The
Buyer will bear the cost of  compliance with (or failure to comply with) any
such Laws.

 

 

**(H)**

 

 

For  periods on and after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall  continue to have all obligations and liabilities under and with
respect to  the  Employee Benefit Plans and to or with respect to all
persons entitled to  benefits under the provisions of each such Employee
Benefit Plan, including,  without limitation, the obligation to provide or
make available welfare benefits  to retired or disabled employees of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section will preclude the
Buyer from  making any modification to, or terminating, such Employee
Benefit  Plans.

 

 

**(I)**

 

 

No  Continuing Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof is an
intended  third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.12_ , and no such
individual  shall have any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 
6.12_.

 

 

**SECTION  6.13** **_TAX  COVENANTS_**

 

 

**(A)**

 

 

Each  of  the Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of its Taxes
resulting  from the transactions contemplated hereby and the Buyer shall have
no liability  therefor.

 

 

**(B)**

filed, all  Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax
periods that  are  due (including extensions) after the Closing Date and for
any Taxable Period  that begins prior to and ends after the Closing Date.

 

 

**(C)**

 

 

All  transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
taxes  and  fees (including any interest and penalties) incurred in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") shall  be paid by the Buyer and the Buyer will prepare and file
all  necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer

For  six  years from and after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent
permitted by  applicable Law, the Buyer and the Company agree to indemnify
and hold harmless  all past and present officers and directors of the Company
and of its  Subsidiaries to the same extent such persons are currently
indemnified by the  Company pursuant to the Company's organizational
documents and Director  Indemnification Agreements for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the  Closing Date, and the Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal
or modify any provision in the Company's  or any of its Subsidiaries'
organizational documents relating to the exculpation  or indemnification of
former officers and directors as in effect immediately  prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that the foregoing will not apply  to  indemnification
claims pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereunder;  _provided_ , _further,_ that
neither the Company nor the Buyer shall be  liable with respect to any
settlements effected without its written consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

 

**(B)**

 

 

The  Buyer  shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain in
effect for six  years  from the Closing Date directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering  those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's existing directors' and  officers' liability insurance policy on
terms not less favorable than such  existing insurance coverage; _provided_ ,
that in the event that any claim  is brought under such director's and
officer's liability insurance policy, such  policy shall be maintained until
final disposition of such claim;  _provided,_ _further,_ that the Company
shall not be required to pay an  annual premium in excess of 250 percent of
the last annual premium paid prior  to  the date thereof, but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as possible  for such amount.

 

 

**(C)**

 

 

In  addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 6.14_ and not
in  limitation thereof (but without in any way limiting or modifying the
obligations  of any insurance carrier contemplated by _Section 6.14_ ), from
and after  the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and
its  Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest 
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and
release  from any liability to the Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries),  the  individuals who, on or prior the Closing Date, were
officers, directors, or  employees or agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or served on  behalf of the Company as an officer, director or
employee or agent of any of  the  Company's current or former Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (collectively,  " _Covered Affiliates_ ") or any of their
predecessors in all of their  capacities (including as member or stockholder,
controlling or otherwise) and  the heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries
and administrators of such officer,  directors or employees or agents (each a
" _D andO Indemnitee_" and,  collectively, the " _D andO Indemnitees_") against
all DandO Expenses,  losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (" _D andO  Costs_") in respect of any threatened, pending or
completed Action based on  or arising out of or relating to the fact that
such Person is or was a director,  officer or employee (controlling or
otherwise) of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or Covered Affiliates
or any of their predecessors arising out  of  acts or omissions occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date (including without  limitation, in respect of
acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement  and the transactions
contemplated thereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable  Claim_"), except for acts or
omissions which involve conduct known to such  Person at the time to
constitute a material violation of applicable law and  (ii)  advance to such
DandO Indemnitees all DandO Expenses incurred in connection  with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the  DandO Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after  receipt of
reasonably detailed statements therefor; provided, however, that  the 
Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to 
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not 
entitled to indemnification. Each DandO Indemnifiable Claim shall  continue
until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,  orders,
decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable  Claim are
fully satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section  6.14(c)_ , " _D andO
Expenses_" shall include reasonable attorneys' fees  and all other reasonable
costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in  connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating  in 
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or
participate  in any Dand O Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses,
judgments and  amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in the
definition of  DandO Costs).

 

 

**(D)**

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.14_   shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely.
In the  event that the Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their  respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges in
to any  other  Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties or assets  to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors
and assigns of the Buyer  or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and be bound  by  the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.14_.

 

 

**(E)**

 

 

The  obligations of the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries under this
_Section  6.14_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely  affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.14_ applies
without  the consent of such affected DandO Indemnitee.

 

 

**SECTION  6.15** **_PRESERVATION  OF RECORDS; POST-CLOSING ACCESS AND
COOPERATION_**

 

 

The  Buyer  and the Company shall preserve and retain, in accordance with
the Buyer\'s record  retention program as in effect from time to time, all

records of the Company  and  each of its Subsidiaries relating to the
conduct of the Business prior to the  Closing Date. If, after the Closing,
the Stockholders need  information contained in the books and records of the

with such  information.

specified date, except where the failure to be so true  and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation or qualification as to  "materiality"
(including the word "material") or "Knowledge" set forth therein)  would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be  materially
adverse to the ability of the Buyer to perform its obligations under  this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby. The Buyer
shall have performed all obligations and agreements  and complied with all
covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to  be  performed or
complied with by it prior to or at the Closing.

**INDEMNIFICATION**

 

 

**SECTION  8.1** **_SURVIVAL  OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES_ _AND
COVENANTS_**

 

 

. The  representations and warranties of the Company, the Stockholders and
the Buyer  contained in this Agreement and any schedule, certificate or other

and its  Affiliates and the respective Representatives, successors and

incurred, sustained or  suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of,
arising out of or relating  to  (i) any breach of any Core Representation or
covenant made by the Company or  any  Stockholder in this Agreement or (ii)
any unpaid Transaction  Expenses. For purposes of this _Section 8.2_ , each
Stockholder's  indemnification obligations shall be several (in accordance
with its percentage  ownership of the Shares and Convertible Bonds as set
forth opposite such  Stockholder's name on _Exhibit A_ ) and not joint.

 

 

**SECTION  8.3** **_INDEMNIFICATION  BY THE BUYER_**

 

 

. The  Buyer shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders
and  their  respective Affiliates, and the respective Representatives,
successors and  assigns of each of the foregoing, from and against any and
all Losses asserted  against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the

any Core Representation or  covenant made by the Buyer in this Agreement, and
(ii) any acts or omissions  by  the Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries
and any obligations and liabilities  in respect of the Buyer and the Company
or its Subsidiaries from  and after the Closing  Date.

 

 

**SECTION  8.4** **_PROCEDURES_**

 

 

**(A)**

 

 

In  order  for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any 
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out 
of  or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any person against the 
Indemnified Party for monetary damages (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such 
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom 
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") within fifteen  Business
Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of  the 
Third Party Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying party with such
information  with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably 
request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not  release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article  VIII_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such 
failure.

 

 

**(B)**

 

 

The  Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified  Party within 15 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the  commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the  expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying  Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
The  Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed  by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party  has  failed to assume the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party does  not expressly elect to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim within  the  time period and otherwise in accordance with
the first sentence of this  _Section 8.4(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall
have the sole right to assume  the defense of and to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the  Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the  Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to  participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel  shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the
employment  of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in
writing by the  Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third
Party Claim  (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified
Party and  the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that  representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both
the Indemnifying  Party and such Indemnified Party may present such counsel
with a conflict of  interest. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third  Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying
Party\'s expense,  cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and
make available to  the  Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information  in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or under
the Indemnified Party\'s control  relating thereto as is reasonably required
by the Indemnifying  Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any Third  Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent  of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld),  enter into any settlement or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment  with respect to such Third Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or  judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of
wrongdoing, (ii) does  not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of  the  Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or  (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any
obligation on the Indemnified Party  other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the Indemnified Party  will be indemnified hereunder.

 

 

**(C)**

 

 

The  indemnification required hereunder in respect of a Third Party Claim
shall  be  made by prompt payment by the Indemnifying Party of the amount of
actual Losses  in connection therewith, as and when bills are received by the
Indemnified  Party  or Losses incurred have been notified to the
Indemnifying Party, together with  interest on any amount not repaid as
necessary to the Indemnified Party by  the  Indemnifying Party within five
Business Days after receipt of notice of such  Losses, from the date such
Losses have been notified to the Indemnifying Party,  at the rate per annum
at which deposits are offered by first class banks to  first class banks in
immediately available funds in the London Interbank Market  for available
funds in the London Interbank Market.

 

 

**(D)**

 

 

In  the  event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party  hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against  or  sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall  deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying  Party. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release  the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this  _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is  prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from  any  other obligation or liability that it may have
to the Indemnified Party or  otherwise than pursuant to this _Article VIII_.
If the  Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification obligation
but asserts  that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that claimed by
the Indemnified  Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount
promptly to the  Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the
Indemnified Party\'s  claim for the difference.

 

 

**(E)**

 

 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of _Section 10.9_ , each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents  to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an
Action in respect  of a  Third Party Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party for purposes of  any  claim that an Indemnified Party may
have under this Agreement with respect  to  such Action or the matters
alleged therein and agrees that process may be served  on each Indemnifying
Party with respect to such claim anywhere.

 

 

**SECTION  8.5** **_INDEMNIFICATION  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY_**

 

 

. Except  in the case of fraud or intentional misconduct, the sole recourse
and exclusive  remedy of the Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders for the
breach of any  representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this  Agreement, any agreement, or instrument contemplated
hereby, any document  relating hereto or thereto contained in any Schedules
or Exhibit to this  Agreement, or otherwise arising from the transactions
contemplated hereby or  the  operations of the Company and its Affiliates
prior to the Closing, shall be  to  assert a claim for indemnification under
the indemnification provisions of  this  Article VIII. Except in the case of
fraud or intentional misconduct,  the only legal action which may be asserted
by any party hereto against any  other party hereto with respect to any
matter which is the subject of this  Article VIII shall be a contract action
to enforce, or to recover Losses as  an  indemnification claim for the
breach of, this Agreement pursuant to the recourse  described in this Article
VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, and  except as set forth in this
_Article VIII_ , each Indemnified Party hereby  waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under  applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims, and causes of action it may have  against any Indemnifying
Party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement  based upon
predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort or strict  liability
or any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation  or
ordinance or otherwise.

 

 

**SECTION  8.6** **_INDEMNIFICATION  LIMITS._**

 

 

**(A)**

 

 

THE  BUYER  AGREES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE
COMPANY AFTER  CLOSING), SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,  EMPLOYEES, STOCKHOLDERS, REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS,
THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  SOURCE OF RECOVERY FOR ANY SUCH PERSON'S
INDEMNIFICATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER OR  IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT IS
TO MAKE AN INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM AGAINST  THE STOCKHOLDERS SEVERALLY AND NOT
JOINTLY AND IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY  INDEMNIFICATION OF OR RECOVERY BY THE
BUYER OR ANY OTHER INDEMNITEE FOR LOSSES  PURSUANT TO _SECTION 8.2_ THAT ARE
RECOVERABLE EXCEED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY  STOCKHOLDER, THE AMOUNT OF THE
PURCHASE PRICE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY SUCH  PERSON.

 

 

**(B)**

 

 

To  the  extent that any Losses which would otherwise be subject to
indemnification  pursuant to this Article VIII were expressly reflected in
the reserves and  accruals in the Financial Statements (but only to the
extent specifically  reserved or accrued), the Buyer or other indemnitee
shall not be able to recover  for such Losses.

 

 

**(C)**

 

 

The  Buyer  may not seek indemnification under this Agreement with regard to
any Losses  to  the extent that such Losses are caused by actions taken by
the Buyer or the  Company after the Closing. After the Closing, the Buyer
shall, and  shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, promptly notify
the Stockholder  Representative upon becoming aware of any fact, occurrence
or event that the  Buyer believes could cause any of the representations and
warranties contained  in _Article III_ to be inaccurate or incomplete in any
respect, and the  Buyer and the Company shall utilize commercially reasonable
efforts, consistent  with normal practices and policies and good commercial
practice to mitigate  such  Losses, including reasonably pursuing any and
all other available indemnity  rights.

 

 

**(D)**

 

 

From  and  after the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall maintain or
cause to be  maintained customary property, casualty, business interruption
and other  insurance in respect of the Company in accordance with the Buyer's
general  practices and industry standards.

 

 

**(E)**

 

 

Any  amounts payable under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ shall be treated 
by the Buyer and the Stockholders as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
and  shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any proceeds received
or  receivable from insurance policies covering the Loss that is the subject
of  the  claim for indemnity (any self-insured, retention, deduction or
similar liability  retention by the Buyer will, for this purpose, be viewed
as actual insurance  for  this purpose, except to the extent any such
insurance proceeds must be  specifically repaid by indemnitee through
adjustments to past, present or future  premiums or other similar mechanism
and net of any costs of obtaining any such  proceeds), (ii) any proceeds
received or receivable from third parties,  including, without limitation,
any party to any Prior Acquisition Agreement,  through indemnification,
counterclaim, reimbursement arrangement, contract  or  otherwise in
compensation for the subject matter of an indemnification claim  by  such
indemnitee (such arrangements referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) in this 
_Section 8.6(e)_ , collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), and  (iii)
the Tax benefit to the indemnitee resulting from, or as a consequence  of, 
the damage, loss, liability or expense that is the subject of the indemnity, 
to  the extent that such Tax benefits are actually received by the 
indemnitee. The Buyer shall have no right to assert any claims  pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ or otherwise with respect to any Losses  that would have
been covered by an Alternative Arrangement had the Buyer  maintained for its
benefit and the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries  the same rights
or coverage under an Alternative Arrangement following the  Closing that was
in effect for the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately  prior to the
Closing.

 

 

**(F)**

 

 

The  Buyer  and the Company after the Closing shall utilize their
commercially reasonable  efforts, consistent with normal practices and
policies and good commercial  practice, to mitigate any amounts payable under
_Section 8.2_ , including  pursuing any and all other remedies to (i) collect
any proceeds pursuant to  Alternative Arrangements covering the Loss that is
the subject to the claim  for  indemnity and (ii) obtain the actual
recognized Tax benefit to the indemnitee  resulting from the Loss that is the
subject of the indemnity. If any  such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are
received by the Buyer or the Company  with respect to any Losses after the
Buyer or the Company has received proceeds  from the Stockholders, the Buyer
or the Company shall promptly, but in any  event  no later than ten Business
Days after the receipt, realization or recovery  of  such proceeds, benefits
or recoveries, pay to the Stockholder Representative  the  amount of such
proceeds, benefits or recoveries for distribution to the  Stockholders. Upon
making a payment to the Buyer or the Company in  respect of any Losses, the
Stockholders will, to the extent of such payment,  be  subrogated to all
rights of the Buyer or the Company against any third party  in  respect of
the Losses to which such payment relates. The Buyer and  the Company will
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary  to  evidence or
further perfect such subrogation rights. Each party  hereby waives any
subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect  to  any
indemnifiable Losses.

 

 

**(G)**

 

 

No  claims  by any party shall be asserted for any breach of a
representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement if such party had
knowledge of such breach at the  date of this Agreement or otherwise at the
time of Closing.

 

 

**(H)**

 

 

Effective  as of the Closing Date, each of the Buyer and the Company (each
a  " _Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its heirs, legal
representatives,  successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to  the  fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the
Stockholders, the Stockholder  Representative and each of their respective
past, present or future officers,  managers, directors, shareholders,
partners, members, Affiliates, employees,  counsel and agents (each a "
_Releasee_ "):) of, from and against any and all  actions, causes of action,
claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues  and  suits of every kind,
nature and description whatsoever (collectively  " _Claims_ "):) which such
Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives,  successors or assigns ever
had, now has or may have on or by reason of any  matter, cause or thing
whatsoever prior to the Closing Date. Each  Releasor agrees not to, and
agrees to cause its respective Affiliates and  Subsidiaries not to, assert
any Claim against the  Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Releasor and its  respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns retain, and  do  not release, their rights and interests under the
terms of this Agreement or  with respect to any Claim or liability resulting
from such Person's fraud,  embezzlement or other criminal act.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE  CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH STOCKHOLDER
WILL ONLY BE LIABLE SEVERALLY,  AND  NOT JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY, FOR ANY
OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE  STOCKHOLDERS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS  _ARTICLE VIII_ , EACH INDIVIDUAL
STOCKHOLDER SHALL ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR  BREACHES OF SUCH STOCKHOLDER'S
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS, AND  NOT FOR BREACHES OF ANY
OTHER STOCKHOLDER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OR  COVENANTS SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT.
