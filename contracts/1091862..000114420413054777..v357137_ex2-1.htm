Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Sellers agree to sell to Buyer, and Buyer
agrees to purchase from Sellers, the Shares at the Closing, free and clear of
any Liens or other rights of third parties other than transfer restrictions
imposed thereon by applicable securities Laws. The aggregate purchase price
for the Shares (the "Purchase Price") is an amount equal to (a) $315,000,000
in cash, _minus_ (b) the amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Indebtedness"), _minus_ (c) the Purchase Price Adjustment Factor. The
Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02 and shall be subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 2.03 and subject to further adjustment
as provided in Section 2.05.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Closing_. (a) The closing (the "Closing") of the
purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder shall take place at (i)
with respect to the Non-German Shares, the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York and (ii) with respect to the
Bayrol Share, the offices of Baker and McKenzie, Neuer Zollhof 3, Dusseldorf,
Germany or the notary Dr. Armin Hauschild, Blumenstraße 28, 40212 Dusseldorf,
Germany, a German notary public, in each case (X) on the last Business Day of
the month in which the later of (i) the conditions set forth in Article 10 are
first satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the applicable party
or parties entitled to their benefit (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (the conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, the "Closing Date Conditions"),
but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) and (ii) the completion of the Marketing Period
occurs, or (Y) at such other time or place as Buyer and Sellers may agree in
writing;  _provided,_ that, without limiting the rights of the parties under
Section 12.01(b), if the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than the
Closing Date Conditions) are first satisfied or waived on a date that is less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the last Business Day of a month, the
Closing shall occur on the last Business Day of the month following the month
during which the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than the Closing
Date Conditions) were first satisfied or waived, _provided_  that (A) the
conditions set forth in Article 10 are satisfied or waived on such later date
and (B) the Marketing Period has been completed by such later date (an
"Extended Closing"); _provided_ , _further,_ that irrespective of what time
of day the Closing would have otherwise occurred, the Closing shall be deemed
to occur at 11:59 P.M. on such date.

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a statement setting forth a good faith
estimate of the Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"),
together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, (ii) a statement
setting forth the Pre-Closing Working Capital, together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation, which statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Calculation Principles, (iii) a statement setting forth
the Pre-Closing MRO Amount determined in accordance with Section 5.17(a),
together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation and (iv) a
statement of any items to be included in the Purchase Price Adjustment Factor
(such statements, collectively, the "Estimate"). The Pre-Closing Working
Capital, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Pre-Closing MRO Amount, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Factor and the Purchase Price adjustment set forth
in Section 2.03, if any, shall be set forth in U.S. dollars after any
applicable portion thereof has been converted from each of the currencies set
forth on Schedule 1.01A at the foreign exchange reference rate with respect
to such currency published in the Wall Street Journal on the Reference Date.

  



  

(c) At the Closing:

  



  

(i) Buyer shall deliver the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.03) to Seller Parent, German Seller and Dutch Seller (in each case
in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller Parent
or Sellers with a bank designated by Seller Parent, by notice to Buyer, which
notice shall be delivered not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date). The parties acknowledge that Schedule 2.02(c)(i) sets forth an
initial allocation, as of the date hereof, of the amount identified in
Section 2.01(a) among Seller Parent, German Seller and Dutch Seller, and a
further allocation of such amount among the Companies and the Subsidiaries.
The parties agree to negotiate in good faith, not later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, an allocation of the Purchase Price among
Seller Parent, German Seller and Dutch Seller (each of which shall be treated
as receiving the Purchase Price as an agent on behalf of the other Sellers to
the extent the portion of Purchase Price received is applicable to the other
Sellers), and a further allocation of the Purchase Price among the Companies
and the Subsidiaries, in each case consistent with the principles of Schedule
2.02(c)(i); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the parties are unable
to agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price prior to the Closing Date,
such disagreement shall not delay the Closing and the final allocation shall
be made pursuant to Section 2.06.

(iii) Dutch Seller and Buyer shall enter into (1) a share transfer
form governed by the law of Australia providing for the transfer of
the BioLab Australia Shares in the form attached as Exhibit E hereto, (2) a
share transfer agreement governed by Canadian law providing for the transfer
of the Bio-Lab Canada Shares in the form attached as Exhibit F hereto and (3)

(iv) German Seller shall, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of GHC Properties, Inc., Great Lakes Holding
(Europe) AG and Chemtura Europe GmbH (or, if applicable, any legal successor
of the foregoing) to, and Buyer shall enter into a share transfer agreement
(the "German Share Transfer Agreement" and together with the Non-German Share
Transfer Documents, the "Share Transfer Documents") in the presence of a
German notary public providing for (i) the transfer of the Bayrol Share from
the German Seller to Buyer and (ii), if applicable, the consent hereto by each
of GHC Properties, Inc., Great Lakes Holding (Europe) AG and Chemtura Europe
GmbH (or any legal successor of the foregoing) in the form attached as Exhibit
H hereto. Buyer shall bear all notary costs and notary expenses related to
the notarization of the German Share Transfer Agreement at Closing.

  



  

(v) Seller Parent (and/or certain of its Affiliates) and Buyer
(and/or certain of its Affiliates) shall execute and deliver the
Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Section 2.03. _Estimated Adjustment of Purchase Price_. (a) At the
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (the amount of such
adjustment, the "Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment"):

  



  

(i) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness shall be used for purposes of
determining the Closing Indebtedness in the calculation of the
Purchase Price;

  



  

(ii) if (x) the Pre-Closing Working Capital exceeds Base Closing
Working Capital then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of
such excess and (y) if Base Closing Working Capital exceeds the Pre-Closing
Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of
such excess; and

  



    

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) if (x) the Pre-Closing MRO Amount exceeds the sum of (1) the
Base MRO Amount and (2) the MRO De Minimis (the "MRO Excess Threshold"), then
the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the Pre-Closing
MRO Amount exceeds the MRO Excess Threshold (the "MRO Excess") and (y) the
Base MRO Amount exceeds the sum of (1) the Pre-Closing MRO Amount and (2) the
MRO De Minimis (the "MRO Deficit Threshold"), then the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the amount by which the Base MRO Amount exceeds the MRO Deficit
Threshold (the "MRO Deficit").

  



  

(iv) Such adjusted Purchase Price shall be delivered at Closing
pursuant to Section 2.02 and shall be subject to further adjustment as
provided in Section 2.05.

  



  

Section 2.04. _Closing Adjustments Schedule_. (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days, after the Closing Date, Buyer
will prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule setting forth Buyer's
calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Closing Indebtedness (the
"Closing Adjustments Schedule"), together with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation. The Final Closing Working Capital, the Final Closing
Indebtedness and the Purchase Price adjustment set forth in Section 2.05, if
any, shall be set forth in U.S. dollars after any applicable portion thereof
has been converted from each of the currencies set forth on Schedule 1.01A at
the foreign exchange reference rate with respect to such currency published in
the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date. The Closing Adjustments Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with the Calculation Principles.

  



  

(b) If Sellers disagree with Buyer's calculation of Closing Working
Capital or the Closing Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section 2.04, which
disputes shall be limited to mathematical errors in the Closing Adjustment
Schedule or the Closing Adjustment Schedule not having been prepared in
accordance with the Calculation Principles, Sellers may, within forty-five
(45) days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.04(a),
deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with any such calculation and setting
forth Sellers' calculation of the applicable amounts and, in reasonable
detail, Sellers' grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Sellers
disagree, and Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Indebtedness, as applicable,
delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a).

  



    

21 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.04(b), Buyer and Sellers shall, during the fifteen (15)
days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as
may be required, the amount of (i) Closing Working Capital, which amount shall
not be less than the amount thereof shown in Buyer's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 2.04(a) nor more than the amount thereof shown in
Sellers' calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b) and (ii) the
Closing Indebtedness, which amount shall not be greater than the amount
thereof shown in Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) nor
less than the amount thereof shown in Sellers' calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 2.04(b). If, during such period, Buyer and Sellers are unable to
reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Ernst and Young LLP,
or if Ernst and Young LLP is unavailable to serve, such other independent
accounting firm of nationally recognized standing that is mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Sellers (such ultimately selected firm, the "Accountant")
promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Indebtedness, as applicable. In making such calculation(s), the Accountant
(A) shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Adjustments
Schedule or Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Indebtedness, as applicable as to which Sellers have disagreed and (B) may not
assign a value to any disputed item or amount greater than the greatest value
for such item or amount claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item or amount claimed by either party. The Accountant shall
deliver to Buyer and Sellers, as promptly as practicable, a written report
setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Sellers. The party (either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on
the other hand) whose calculation of the disputed items and amounts of the
Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Indebtedness, as applicable (the
"Disputed Calculation"), is closer in amount to the Disputed Calculation as
finally determined by the Accountant in accordance with this Section
2.04(c) (the "Objection Dispute Prevailing Party") shall pay a percentage of
the fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant calculated by dividing (x) the
amount of the difference between the Objection Dispute Prevailing Party's
calculation of Disputed Calculation and the Disputed Calculation as finally
determined by the Accountant, by (y) the amount of the difference between
the Objection Dispute Prevailing Party's calculation of Disputed Calculation
and the non-Objection Dispute Prevailing Party's calculation of the Disputed
Calculation. The non-Objection Dispute Prevailing Party shall pay the
remainder of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant. For example, if
Sellers claim that the Disputed Calculation is $1,000 greater than the
Disputed Calculation as determined by Buyers and if the Accountant ultimately
resolves the Objections Dispute by awarding to Sellers $300 of the $1,000
contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant will be
allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to
Sellers.

  



  

(d) Buyer and Sellers agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and the Companies and each Subsidiary to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Adjustments Schedule
and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Closing Indebtedness
and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section,
including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records,
work papers and personnel.

  



  

Section 2.05. _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price._ (a)
Following the determination of Final Closing Working Capital and the Final
Closing Indebtedness, a payment shall be made by Seller Parent, on behalf of
Sellers, or Buyer, as applicable, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and
shall be paid in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(b)
(the "Final Purchase Price Adjustment"), in accordance with the following:

  



    

22 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) if Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Pre-Closing
Working Capital, Seller Parent, on behalf of Seller, shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the difference between the Pre-Closing Working Capital and
Final Closing Working Capital;

  



  

(ii) if Final Closing Working Capital exceeds the Pre-Closing Working
Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, an amount
equal to the difference between Final Closing Working Capital and Pre-Closing
Working Capital;

  



  

(iii) if the Final Closing Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers,
an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Closing Indebtedness
and the Final Closing Indebtedness; and

  



  

(iv) if the Final Closing Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the difference between the Final Closing Indebtedness and the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer and Seller
Parent, on behalf of Sellers, agree that the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
shall be settled in U.S. dollars (determined based on the foreign exchange
rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date).

  



  

"Final Closing Working Capital" and "Final Closing Indebtedness" mean Closing
Working Capital and the Closing Indebtedness, respectively, as shown in
Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04, if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b); or if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, as agreed by Buyer
and Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or in
the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accountant's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

  



  

(b) Any payments pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be made in U.S.
dollars and shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within ten
(10) days after Final Closing Working Capital and the Final Closing
Indebtedness have been determined by delivery by Seller Parent, on behalf of
Sellers, or Buyer, as the case may be, by causing such payments to be credited
to such account of such other party as may be designated by such other party.
The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section shall bear
interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%). Such interest shall
be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.

  



    

23 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Payments made pursuant to this Section 2.05 will be made and
treated by the parties for all purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price and will not be subject to setoff in respect of any amounts owing or
claimed to be owing among the parties or any of their Affiliates for any
reason.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Allocation of the Purchase Price._ Within ninety (90)
days after the final determination of Final Closing Working Capital and the
Final Closing Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.04, Buyer shall provide to
Seller Parent a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.05 (plus any liabilities to the extent
properly taken into account for U.S. federal income tax purposes), among the
Shares (other than the Bio-Lab Shares), the covenants contained in Section
5.08 and the assets of Bio-Lab (including the assets of the Subsidiaries of
Bio-Lab that are classified as disregarded entities for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as of the Closing Date) in a manner consistent with
Section 2.02(c)(i) and Applicable Law (the "Allocation Statement"). If within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement, Seller Parent
notifies Buyer in writing that Seller Parent objects to the allocation set
forth in the Allocation Statement, Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. In the event that Sellers and Buyer are
unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days, the parties shall
cause an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers to resolve such dispute in a
manner consistent with the procedures described in Section 2.04(c). In the
event an amount is treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 8.04(f), Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
mutually agree to revisions of the Allocation Statement to reflect such
adjustment. The parties shall cause all Tax Returns to be prepared and filed
consistently with the Allocation Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging such Allocation Statement.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Buyer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, provincial, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that such amounts
are so withheld by Buyer, such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer; _provided_ , that,
except as set forth on Schedule 2.07, Buyer shall not exercise its right to
assign its rights under Section 13.04 to an Affiliate to the extent that such
Affiliate with respect to the acquisition of a Company would be required to
deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement any amounts under the Code or any provision of state, provincial,
local or foreign Tax law.

Article 3 
 Representations and Warranties of Sellers

  



  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules (but subject to Section
13.11), Seller Parent and Sellers, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date that:

  



  

Section 3.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Seller Parent and
each Seller and each of the Companies is duly incorporated or formed, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable)
under the Applicable Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation
and has all corporate or other organizational powers and all Permits and
consents required to own or lease its properties and carry on its business as
now conducted, except for those Permits and consents, the absence of which
would not be material to the Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as a

Seller Parent and Buyer at Seller Parent's sole discretion, or subject to
Company Employee consent where such may be validly provided under Applicable
Law), (3) bids received by or on behalf of Sellers from other Persons in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids

cause Seller Parent, Sellers, any Company or any of the Subsidiaries to breach
a confidentiality obligation (in which event Sellers shall use reasonable
efforts to share such information in a manner that would not jeopardize any
such privilege or violate such obligations) or (B) conduct or cause to be
conducted any invasive sampling, testing or other invasive investigation of
the air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or
other environmental media.

  



  

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Sellers will to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law afford to Buyer and its
agents reasonable access to their books of account, financial and other
records (including accountant's work papers), information, employees and
auditors to the extent necessary or useful for Buyer in connection with any
audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or any other reasonable business
purpose relating to the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries; _provided_ that
any such access by Buyer shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of Seller Parent or Sellers.

  



    

52 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Buyer shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses

condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of
any of the conditions set forth in Article 10 impossible or unlikely; and

commenced relating to Sellers or the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.13.

  



  

Section 5.04. _Resignations_. Sellers will deliver to Buyer the
original resignations (and not copies) of all officers and directors of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries who will be officers, directors or employees
of Sellers or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date from
their positions with the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries at or prior to
the Closing Date (the "Resignations").

  



  

Section 5.05. _Termination of German PLP Agreement._ Buyer agrees
that Seller Parent, German Seller and Bayrol are permitted to take all
necessary actions to cause the German PLP Agreement to be terminated,
effective as of the Closing Date and have such termination registered
with the commercial register of Bayrol.

  



  

Section 5.06. _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the earlier
of (a) the Closing Date and (b) such date on which this Agreement terminates
in accordance with Article 12, each of the Sellers and Seller Parent shall
not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, and employees not to, and none of them will
permit any of their respective representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person, or enter into any contract or agreement, relating to
the direct or indirect acquisition of the Shares or the Business or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding such an acquisition
of the Business or the Shares or furnish or cause to be furnished any
confidential or proprietary information with respect thereto to any Person (in
each case, other than Buyer and its representatives). Seller Parent, Sellers
and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, and representatives will promptly cease any such existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer and
its representatives) heretofore conducted, or the provision of any
confidential or proprietary information to any Person (other than Buyer and
its representatives) to which confidential or proprietary information
heretofore has been provided, with respect to any direct or indirect
acquisition of the Shares or the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.06, the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.06 on indirect acquisitions shall not in any way limit Seller
Parent's ability to enter into, or cause to be entered into, a transaction
subject to the rights and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Any breach of this Section 5.06 by any representative
of Sellers, Seller Parent or any of their respective Affiliates shall
be deemed a breach of this Section 5.06 by Seller Parent and Sellers.

not, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,

prior written consent of Buyer, disclose to any third party (other than each
other and their respective Representatives) for a period of five (5) years
after the Closing Date, any confidential or proprietary information related
to the Business or made available to Seller Parent, such Seller or such
Affiliate pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements or in connection with the negotiation and consideration thereof;
_provided_  that the foregoing restriction shall not (a) apply to any

right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

each of them shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, own, manage or operate any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in any
Competing Business anywhere in the world; _provided_ , _however_ , that it
shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.08 for Seller Parent,
any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates to invest in or own or hold
any publicly-traded securities of any Restricted Person so long as Seller
Parent's, such Seller's or such Affiliate's investment or interest is less
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of any class of such
publicly-traded securities in such Restricted Person and Seller Parent, such
Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, do not Control such Restricted Person
or participate directly in such Restricted Person's Competing Business. If
and to the extent the aforementioned non-competition obligation has effect on
any markets in Europe, (i) the term of the non-competition obligation shall be
limited to the period from the Closing Date until the third anniversary of
the Closing Date and (ii) the geographical scope shall be restricted to the
countries set forth in Schedule 5.08;  _provided_ that in no event shall this
sentence limit the non-competition obligations with respect to markets outside
of Europe. If and to the extent the aforementioned non-competition obligation
has effect on any markets in Australia, (x) the term of the non-competition
obligation shall be limited to the period from the Closing Date until any of
the fifth, fourth, third, second and first anniversary of the Closing Date
and (y) the geographical scope shall be any of Australia, Queensland, Western
Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, the Northern
Territory and Australian Capital Territory; _provided_  that in no event
shall this sentence limit the non-competition obligations with respect to
markets outside of Australia.

(b) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of Section 5.08 is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  



  

Section 5.09. _Assignment of Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(a) Prior to Closing, Seller Parent and Sellers shall, at Sellers'
cost and expense, assign and transfer, and cause their Affiliates to assign

Lab (or to such other Company or Subsidiary requested by Buyer) in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

(b) Without limiting any of Buyer's rights or remedies hereunder
(including, without limitation, Buyer's rights under Section 5.14), to the

Affiliates and existing as of the Closing is not owned by any of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries following the Closing by virtue of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, Seller Parent hereby grants
(or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to grant) to the Companies and
the Subsidiaries a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (other than to
third parties in the ordinary course of business or Affiliates of the

concurrently with the Closing, Seller Parent and Sellers shall, or shall cause
the Companies and Subsidiaries to, pay all Transaction Expenses, such that

Section 5.11. _Waiver_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller Parent
and each Seller and its respective Affiliates hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waive any claims that such Person, in its capacity as an equity

in the future against any Company or any Subsidiary and releases, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, the Companies, the
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, directors, managers and
officers, from any and all Proceedings with respect thereto; _provided,
however_ , that nothing contained herein shall operate to release any claims

Affiliates arising under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Schedule 5.12, Seller Parent and Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, assign to Buyer, effective at Closing, any and all
confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements and other
similar agreements (a) entered into in respect of the sale process relating
to the Companies and (b) that relate to the Business to which none of the
Companies is a party. Seller Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to assign the
confidentiality agreements listed on Schedule 5.12 to Buyer. To the extent any
such agreements are not assigned to Buyer, Seller Parent and Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, to enforce such agreements at
Buyer's request and at Buyer's expense.

  



  

Section 5.13. _Transition Matters_. (a) From and after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller Parent and each Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the matters described on Schedule

any such matter and the Closing, including by using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) make available, or cause to be made available, employees or
other service providers capable of addressing the matters described on
Schedule 5.13(a), (ii) cause such employees or other service providers to
meet with Buyer and its representatives during regular business hours at such
times and locations as Buyer or its representatives may reasonably request
and (iii) provide, or cause to be provided, such reasonable information and
reasonable assistance to Buyer and its representatives as Buyer and its
representatives may reasonably request.

Companies and the Subsidiaries to, complete the matters described on
Schedule 5.13(b) prior to the Closing.

reasonable consultation and coordination with the Seller Parent and Sellers,
Buyer shall have access to, and the right to engage in discussions and other
communications with, each of the Company Employees regarding benefits

discussions and communications do not unreasonably interfere with work
performance.

  



  

(d) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller
Parent and Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and consult in
identifying those roles for new employees as are reasonably necessary for the
operation of the Business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries on a stand-
alone basis (but otherwise as conducted prior to the Closing) at and after
the Closing. Upon identification of such roles for new employees, Seller
Parent and Sellers shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts, in reasonable consultation with and subject
to the consent of Buyer (including, without limitation, with respect to levels
and amounts of salary, benefits, and other compensation, and which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to hire new
employees (who shall be Company Employees hereunder) to fill such roles. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates have
any liability in respect of (i) any such new employees in the event that the
Closing does not occur and (ii) any hiring or onboarding costs associated
with such new employees.

  



  

(e) Set forth on Schedule 5.13(e) is the team of Persons (and their
contact information) designated by Seller Parent and Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand (the "Transition Team"), that will oversee
the planning and implementation of the matters set foth this Section 5.13.
The parties shall ensure that their respective members of the Transition Team
shall meet in person or telephonically at such times as are reasonably
requested by Seller Parent or Buyer to review and discuss the status of, and
any issues arising in connection with, the the planning and implementation of
the matters set forth this Section 5.13. Each party may re-designate its
respective members of the Transition Team from time to time; _provided_ it
shall notify the other party in writing of the name and contact information
for the newly designated members of the Transition Team in accordance with
Section 13.01.

Section 5.14. _Unprovided Assets_. After the Closing, in the event
that (x) any tangible or intangible property or asset relating to the Business
of the Companies and the Subsidiaries has not been transferred to Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
(y) the failure to deliver such property or asset would result in a breach of
Section 3.27, Seller Parent and Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, promptly transfer such property or asset to the
applicable Company or Subsidiary so long as Seller Parent or its
Affiliates continues to hold such property or asset at the time that Buyer
demands delivery thereof (it being understood that, to the extent that this
Section 5.14 applies to any Company Intellectual Property, such application
shall be limited to Registered Intellectual Property).

  



  

Section 5.15. _June Financial Statements_. Within twenty (20)
Business Days following the date hereof, but in all events prior to the
Closing, Seller Parent and Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to Buyer an unaudited combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2013
and related unaudited combined statement of income and cash flows for the six-
month period then ended of the Companies and the Subsidiaries (the "GAAP June
Financial Statements") that (x) are prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistent with the Audited Financial Statements (except that the GAAP June
Financial Statements shall exclude the assets and liabilities of Adrian) and
(y) except for adjustments identified in Schedule 5.15, contain amounts which
are the same as the amounts set forth in the June Financial Statements. For
purposes of Section 10.02(a)(ii) and for the making of the representations
and warranties in Section 3.09 at the Closing, the representations and
warranties in Section 3.09 shall be made, _mutatis mutandis_ , as if the GAAP
June Financial Statements were the June Financial Statements as of the
date hereof and the exceptions provided for on Schedule 3.09(a) that relate
to the June Financial Statements were removed.

  



  

Section 5.16. _Certain Software Licenses_. (a) From the date hereof
and through the date that is the earlier of (a) forty-five (45) days from the
date hereof and (b) five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller
Parent and Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to create a list of all Non-Transferable
Software and the applicable number of users thereof at the Companies and
Subsidiaries as of the expected Closing Date. Promptly following the creation
of any such list, and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller Parent a written
statement, together with reasonable supporting documentation (the "Non-
Transferable Software Statement"), of any such Non-Transferable Software that
the Companies or Subsidiaries will reasonably require as of and following the
Closing to operate the Business in a manner consistent with the operation of
such Business as of the Closing, the number of required licensed users for
such Non-Transferable Software (which shall not exceed the number of users as
of the Closing) and the applicable cost to the Companies and Subsidiaries to
procure licenses for the operation of such Non-Transferable Software by such
licensed users.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, an amount equal to one half of the sum of the
applicable costs of procuring the Non-Transferable Software listed on the
Non-Transferable Software Statement (on terms and conditions substantially
similar to those that are applicable to the Companies and the Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date) shall be added to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Factor.

  



    

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer will
deliver to Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, a statement, together
with reasonable supporting evidence (the "Licensed Software Statement"), that
the Companies and/or the Subsidiaries have in fact procured licenses to Non-
Transferable Software for the number of licensed users listed on the Non-
Transferrable Software Statement. To the extent that the Licensed Software
Statement does not contain licenses for all of the Non-Transferable
Software for the number of users listed on the Non-Transferrable Software
Statement (any such omissions (relating to software licenses and/or numbers
of licensed users), the "Non-Licensed Software"), Buyer will promptly refund
any amounts included in the Purchase Price Adjustment Factor that relate to
such Non-Licensed Software (subject to reasonable modifications to the
extent the Non-Licensed Software was procured on terms materially more
favorable to Buyer from those set forth on the Non-Transferable Software
Statement) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04(c) modified,
_mutatis mutandis_ , to reflect amounts so refunded in lieu of amounts paid
due to differences in the Final Closing Working Capital and Closing Working
Capital and Final Closing Indebtedness and Closing Indebtedness. For purposes
of this Section 5.16, "Non-Transferable Software" means any computer software
that is licensed to Seller Parent or its Affiliates (including the Companies
and the Subsidiaries), used by the Companies or Subsidiaries to operate the
Business as conducted prior to the Closing Date, and for which the
applicable license agreement governing the use of such computer software
prohibits the continued use of such computer software by the Companies and/or
the Subsidiaries as of and following the Closing.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Buyer
identifies any Non-Transferable Software that was not listed on the Non-
Transferable Software Statement ("Additional Non-Transferable Software")
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
the right to deliver an additional written statement of any Additional Non-
Transferable Software, together with reasonable supporting documentation that
such Additional Non-Transferrable Software has in fact been licensed by any
Company and/or Subsidiary (an "Additional Non-Transferable Software
Statement"), which software Buyer reasonably believes is necessary to operate
the Business as conducted prior to the Closing Date. Within ten (10) Business
Days following Buyer's delivery to Seller Parent of an Additional Non-
Transferable Software Statement with respect to the Additional Non-
Transferable Software, Seller Parent shall reimburse Buyer an amount equal to
one half of the sum of the applicable costs of procuring the Additional Non-
Transferable Software listed on the Additional Non-Transferable Software
Statement.

  



  

Section 5.17. _Closing MRO Adjustments_. (a) Between the date hereof
and a date which is at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller Parent and Sellers shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a
physical stock take of the MRO (the "MRO Inventory") held by the Companies
and the Subsidiaries and determine the Pre-Closing MRO Amount in accordance
with the MRO Calculation Principles, consistently applied. Buyer shall be
given the reasonable opportunity to observe the MRO Inventory.

  



    

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
deliver to Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, a schedule, together with
reasonable supporting documentation (the "Closing MRO Schedule"), setting
forth Buyer's calculation of the Closing MRO Amount, determined in accordance
with the MRO Calculation Principles, consistently applied, by either (at
Buyer's election) (x) updating the Pre-Closing MRO Amount to reflect changes
in the MRO held by the Companies and the Subsidiaries between the Pre-Closing
MRO Amount Determination Date and the Closing based on the books and records
of the Companies and the Subsidiaries or (y) undertaking a physical stock take
(complete or on a test basis, (it being understood that if Buyer calculates
Closing MRO Amount by means of a physical stock take that covers less than
all of the MRO of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, Buyer shall not be
entitled to extrapolate from the results of such physical stock take for the
purposes of determining Closing MRO Amount) of the MRO held by the Companies
and the Subsidiaries at and as of Closing. If Buyer elects to determine
Closing MRO Amount by means of a physical stock take, Seller Parent shall
be given the reasonable opportunity to observe such stock take.

  



  

(c) If Sellers disagree with the Closing MRO Schedule, Seller
Parent, on behalf of Sellers, may, within forty-five (45) days after
delivery thereof, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such schedule
and setting forth Sellers' revisions thereto. Any such notice of disagreement
shall specify those items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing MRO Schedule.

  



  

(d) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to
Section 5.17(c), Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer shall, during
the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine, as may be required, the disputed items or amounts
contained in the Closing MRO Schedule. If, during such period, Seller Parent,
on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause the Accountant, promptly to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts contained in the Closing MRO Schedule for
the purposes of calculating Closing MRO Amount. In making such calculation,
the Accountant (A) shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing
MRO Schedule which are subject to Sellers' notice of disagreement delivered
pursuant to Section 5.17(c) and (B) may not assign a value to any disputed
item or amount greater than the greatest value for such item or amount
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item or
amount claimed by either party. The Accountant shall deliver to Seller
Parent, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after its engagement, a report setting
forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Sellers
and Buyer. The cost of such review and report shall be allocated in
accordance with the provisions for allocating the costs associated with the
Accountant's review of a Disputed Calculation pursuant to Section 2.04(c)
modified, _mutatis mutandis_ , to reflect differences in Buyer's and Sellers'
calculation of Closing MRO Amount in lieu of differences in Buyer's and
Sellers' calculations of Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing
Indebtedness.

(e) If the Pre-Closing MRO Amount and the Final Closing MRO Amount
differ, a payment shall be made by Seller Parent, on behalf of Sellers, or
Buyer, as applicable, to compensate the other party for the economic benefit,
if any, that would have been received or withheld if the Purchase Price
adjustment mechanism in Section 2.03(a)(iii) were calculated using the Final
Closing MRO Amount in lieu of the Pre-Closing MRO Amount (such payment, for
the avoidance of doubt shall be adjusted for any payments made in connection
with an MRO Excess or MRO Deficit at the Closing). "Final Closing MRO Amount"
means the Closing MRO Amount as shown in Buyer's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 5.17(b), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto
is duly delivered pursuant to Section 5.17(c); or if such a notice of
disagreement is delivered, as agreed by Buyer and Seller Parent, on behalf of
Sellers, pursuant to Section 5.17(d) or in the absence of such agreement, as
shown in the independent accounting firm's calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 5.17(d). Any payments pursuant to Section 5.17(e) shall be made in
accordance with, and at the same time as, the payment procedures described in
Section 2.05(c) modified, _mutatis mutandis_ , to reflect the procedures for
compensating the parties for differences in the Final Closing MRO Amount and
the Closing MRO Amount in lieu of differences in the Final Closing Working
Capital and Closing Working Capital and Final Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Indebtedness.

  



  

Section 5.18. _Financing. _ (a) Until the earlier of the
consummation of the Closing and such time as this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article 12, Seller Parent and each Seller agrees to, and
shall cause each Company and each Subsidiary to, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its respective directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense to the extent provided in the third sentence of Section 5.18(b): (i)
provide all cooperation and information reasonably requested by Buyer or the
Financing Sources in connection with the arrangement, placement or completion
of the Debt Financing, including information required by applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including
without limitation information required under the Patriot Act within the time
periods required by the Debt Commitment Letter); (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Representatives of each Company and
each Subsidiary to participate in a reasonable number of customary meetings
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt
Financing and the Companies' senior management), due diligence sessions,
management presentations, drafting sessions, road shows and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing and assist Buyer in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing; (iii) provide
reasonable assistance in obtaining any consents, waivers,
estoppels, approvals, authorizations and instruments of third parties
necessary or reasonably requested in connection with the Debt Financing; (iv)
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such financial and other
information as is required to prepare the confidential offering memorandum
described in Section 4 of the Debt Commitment Letter (such information, the
"Required Information") and such other financial or other information
relating to the Companies and their Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested and as is customary for use in information documents with respect
to the placement, arrangement and/or syndication of loans of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment or as is otherwise required by the Debt
Commitment Letter within the time periods required by the Debt Commitment
Letter; (v) reasonably cooperate with respect to matters relating to pledges
of collateral to take effect at the consummation of Closing in connection
with the Debt Financing; (vi) assist with the preparation of bank information
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing and (vii) assist in the preparation of, and cause each Company and
each Subsidiary to execute and deliver in a timely manner, credit,
indemnification and other definitive financing agreements and other
certificates and documents, including, without limitation, lien waivers,
estoppels, solvency certificates, officers' certificates demonstrating
compliance with restrictive covenants, consents, pledge and security documents
and perfection certificates, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however,_ that (y) nothing herein shall
require any Company or any Subsidiary to take any action that would be
effective prior to the consummation of the Closing and (z) none of the
Companies nor any Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any agreements
prior to the consummation of the Closing unless such agreements and the other
documents and instruments referred to above shall only be effective upon the
consummation of the Closing.

  



    

61

--- 

    



  

(b) None of Seller Parent, Sellers, the Companies, nor any
Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur
any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing (including any fee or payment pursuant to any
"flex" provisions) or any of the foregoing that would be treated as a
Transaction Expense. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers, the Companies
and the Subsidiaries shall not, except as set forth in this Agreement, have
any liability to any Person under or in connection with the arrangement and
funding of the Financing or any alternative debt financing that Buyer may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyer shall promptly, upon request by any Seller, reimburse the Companies only
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Companies or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of the Companies and their
Affiliates contemplated by this Section 5.18.

  



  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer
shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce all of its
rights pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter to obtain the Financing at or
prior to the Closing _provided_ that all of the conditions to Buyer's
obligations under Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 (except those to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived; and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) described in the
Financing Letters and the Debt Commitment Fee Letter, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely basis (or, if
commercially reasonable, obtain the waiver of) all conditions and covenants
within its control that are applicable to Buyer in the Financing Letters and
Debt Commitment Fee Letter that are to be satisfied by Buyer, (B) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (C) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained herein and
therein (including in the event that all conditions hereunder and to the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, using its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund in accordance with the terms
thereof on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall "commercially
reasonable efforts" include any obligation on the part of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to commence or threaten to commence any action against the Persons
contemplated to provide the Financing.

(d) Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably informed of material
developments relating to the Debt Financing and, if reasonably requested
in writing by Sellers, on the status of its efforts relating thereto (in each
case, subject to applicable confidentiality requirements). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers in
writing of (i) the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written
communication, in each case from any Financing Source with respect to any
material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any of the Financing Letters or other material agreements related to the
Financing, (ii) any material dispute or disagreement between or among parties
to any of the Financing Letters with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing and (iii)
if at any time for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Financing Letters and the Debt Commitment
Fee Letter. In the event Buyer shall be required to notify Sellers pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, as soon as reasonably practicable after
Sellers deliver to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Sellers in writing relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence , subject to
applicable confidentiality requirements. In the event any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Debt Commitment Fee Letter, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing ("Alternative
Financing") from alternative sources in an amount sufficient (together with
the Equity Financing and cash on hand) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms taken as a whole that
are not materially less favorable to Buyer than those in the Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Commitment Fee Letter and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter with respect to such alternative debt financing, which shall replace
the existing Debt Commitment Letter (and, if obtained, copies of which shall
be promptly provided to Sellers); _provided_ , that if Buyer proceeds with
alternative debt financing, it shall be subject to the same obligations as
set forth in this Section 5.18(d) with respect to the Debt Financing and
Seller Parent and Sellers shall be subject to the same obligations as set
forth in Section 5.18(a) with respect to the Debt Financing.

--- 

    



  

(e) Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter, if such
amendment, modification or waiver (i) would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing, (ii) would materially adversely affect the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing or (iii)
would impose new or additional material conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the timely
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) make
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur; _provided_ , that Buyer
may (x) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (y) subject to the
other limitations contained in this Section 5.18(e), otherwise replace or
amend the Debt Commitment Letter so long as such action would not reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent the Closing and the terms are not materially
less beneficial to Buyer, with respect to conditionality, than those in the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Buyer
shall promptly deliver to Sellers copies of any such replacement,
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver.

  



  

Article 6 
 Covenants of Buyer

  



  

Buyer agrees that:

  



  

Section 6.01. _Confidentiality_. Any information provided by Seller

any of the Subsidiaries to furnish to Sellers or provide Sellers with access
to information which is subject to attorney-client privilege (in which event
Buyer and Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to share such information in a
manner that would not jeopardize any such privilege or violate such
obligations). Seller Parent and Sellers will hold, and will cause their
respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless required to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law,

practicable after the Closing, but in any event within one hundred twenty
(120) days following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to (a) cease all use of the Seller Marks and (b) remove, destroy
or strike over all Seller Marks from the Companies' and the Subsidiaries'
assets and other materials, including as part of their stationary, displays,
signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email and other
materials. Any use by any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries of the Seller
Marks during the limited phase-out period provided in this Section 6.03 shall

goods and services in connection with which the Companies and the

and bear the Seller Marks; _provided_  that the Companies and the
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such
appearances of the Seller Marks in the ordinary course of business, (C) for
the avoidance of doubt, the appearance of the Seller Marks in or on any third
party's publications, marketing materials, brochures, instruction sheets,

generally are in the public domain, or any other similar uses by any such
third party over which Buyer, the Companies, or any their Subsidiaries have no
control or have not after the Closing Date authorized or otherwise permitted
shall not be considered a violation of this Section 6.03 and (D) the use by
Buyer, the Companies, or any of their Subsidiaries of the Seller Marks in a
non-trademark manner for purposes of conveying to customers or the
general public that ownership of the Companies and their Subsidiaries has
changed shall not be considered a violation of this Section 6.03 (it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall anything in
this clause (D) be construed as limiting or waiving any of Seller Parent's,
Sellers' or any of their Affiliates' rights to enforce the Seller Marks
under Applicable Law and/or otherwise constitute an admission by Seller
Parent, Sellers or any of their Affiliates that any use of the Seller Marks
by Buyer, the Companies or their Subsidiaries is use in a non-trademark manner
under Applicable Law). For the purposes of this Section 6.03, "Seller Marks"

Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries) that are attached
to, imprinted on, or used in connection with, the Companies' and the

assert, and agrees to cause the Companies and any Subsidiary to waive and not
to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of
Sellers or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of any Company or
any Subsidiary (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated

in connection with a dispute with Buyer, and following the Closing, with the
Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control
such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Sellers; _provided_  that
the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, or to communications with any Person other
than the Designated Persons and their advisers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the rights of any Company or any Subsidiary with
respect to confidentiality or privilege that may be owed to it by any
Designated Person be waived and are hereby retained by each Company and
Subsidiary.

Seller by Closing at the latest with originals of the termination notice and
the minutes of the shareholders' meeting of German Seller, certified copies
of which shall be attached to the aforementioned application for registration.

  



  

Section 6.06. _Nine Month Labeling Matters_. In the event any Buyer
Indemnitee identifies any inconsistency between registrations or labels
approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or another Governmental
Authority pursuant to Environmental Law and those utilized on or for any
product that is shipped and/or distributed by the Companies or any Subsidiary
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a Nine Month Labeling
Claim, then Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the
risk of such Nine Month Labeling Claim commencing at the time that such Buyer
Indemnitee becomes aware thereof. Other than as may be incurred in connection
with the design, printing, preparation, application, internal filing or other

meeting or conference relating to such request or legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any substantive document,

connection with such request or legal proceeding.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer to (i) implement any
divestiture, (ii) commence or defend litigation or (iii) agree to any other
condition or consent decree or enter into any contract if doing so
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to impose
restrictions or have an adverse impact on the Business, Buyer, the Companies,

and operations.

  



  

Section 7.02. _Certain Filings and Actions_.

  



  

(a) Seller Parent and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable

public statement without prior written consent of the other party; _provided_
that the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures of information made by or

Section 7.04. _Intercompany Accounts; Affiliate Transactions_.

  



  

(a) Each of Bayrol and its subsidiaries BioLab UK and Bayrol France

parties grant loans to each other (the "Bayrol Intragroup Credit Facility
Agreements"). Seller Parent and Sellers shall cause the Bayrol Intragroup
Credit Facility Agreements to be terminated three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date and evidence thereof shall have been provided to Buyer in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Any amounts (including
any interest accrued thereon) payable under the Bayrol Intragroup Credit

(b) Other than with respect to the Bayrol Intragroup Credit Facility
Agreements as addressed in Section 7.04(a), the German PLP Agreement pursuant

Date, all Related Party Transactions (including the Seller Parent Debt
Documents) shall be terminated, all liens relating thereto released and
settled in full, without any liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) following the Closing, and

Section 7.05. _Employee Nonsolicitation_. (a) Until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, each of Sellers, Seller Parent and Buyer
shall not, and each shall cause their respective Affiliates and
representatives acting on its behalf not to, directly or indirectly,
target, solicit for employment or employ (including in any consulting
capacity) any employee of Sellers or Seller Parent or their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, or any employee of Buyer or the
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, as
applicable, (collectively, the "Restricted Employees"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing shall prohibit either of Seller Parent, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates from targeting, or soliciting for employment (but they
shall not hire), (1) persons, who respond to a general solicitation or
advertisement that is not specifically directed to Restricted Employees or
(2) who are referred to such Person by search firms, employment agencies or
other similar entity; _provided_ that such entities have not been
specifically instructed by such Person to solicit Restricted Employees. If and
to the extent the aforementioned nonsolicitation obligation has effect on any
employees residing in Australia, the term of the nonsolicitation obligation
shall be limited to the period from the Closing Date until any of twenty
four, eighteen, twelve and six months after the Closing Date;  _provided_
that in no event shall this sentence limit the nonsolicitation obligations
with respect to employees residing outside of Australia.

  



  

(b) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of Section 7.04 is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  



  

Section 7.06. _Settlement of German PLP Agreement_. (a) German
Seller shall be entitled to fully receive Bayrol's profits or, as applicable,
be obliged to compensate any of Bayrol's losses for the fiscal year 2012 in
accordance with the German PLP Agreement. The final profit payment or loss
compensation payment, as the case may be, payable under the German PLP
Agreement for the fiscal year 2012 shall be determined on the basis of the
financial statements of Bayrol for the fiscal year 2012 to be prepared in
accordance with the German Commercial Code ( _HGB_ ) and consistent with past
practice and audited and certified by Bayrol's auditors ("Bayrol Financial
Statements 2012"). The settlement of the German PLP for the fiscal year 2012

(b) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date,
in accordance with Applicable Law, Buyer shall (i) cause the management of
Bayrol to prepare interim financial statements of Bayrol for the period
between January 1, 2013 and the Closing Date in accordance with the German
Commercial Code ( _HGB_ ) and consistent with past practice and have such
financial statements audited and certified by Bayrol's auditors ("Bayrol
Financial Statements 2013") and (ii) provide Sellers with a copy of
the Bayrol Financial Statements 2013 promptly thereafter, and in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after the Bayrol Financial Statements 2013
have been audited and certified. In the event that the Bayrol Financial
Statements 2013 establish a profit to be transferred under the German PLP
Agreement, (i) Buyer shall cause Bayrol to pay to German Seller the amount of
such profit (the "Bayrol Profit Payment 2013") in accordance with the terms
of the German PLP Agreement and within ten (10) Business Days after German
Seller has received the Bayrol Financial Statements 2013, and (ii) within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Bayrol Profit Payment 2013, German
Seller shall pay the amount of the Bayrol Profit Payment 2013 to Buyer (the
"Bayrol Profit Reimbursement Payment 2013"). If the Bayrol Profit Payment
2013 is subject to dividend withholding Tax in Germany (
_Kapitalertragsteuer_ ), Buyer shall cause Bayrol to withhold such amount of
dividend withholding tax from the Bayrol Profit Payment 2013 as required by
German statutory tax law, to declare such amount of Tax with and to pay it to
the appropriate Taxing Authority for the account of the German Seller and to
provide German Seller, as promptly as practicable thereafter, with the
dividend withholding tax certificate ( _Kapitalertragssteuerbescheinigung_ ).
In the event that the Bayrol Financial Statements 2013 establish a loss to be
compensated under the German PLP Agreement, (i) German Seller shall pay to
Bayrol the amount of such loss (the "Bayrol Loss Payment 2013") in accordance
with the terms of the German PLP Agreement and within ten (10) Business Days
after German Seller has received the Bayrol Financial Statements 2013 and (ii)
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Bayrol Loss Payment 2013
by Bayrol, Buyer shall pay the amount of the Bayrol Loss Payment to German
Seller (the "Bayrol Loss Reimbursement Payment 2013"). If the Closing Date is
later than December 31, 2013, this Section 7.06(b) shall apply (in addition
to the foregoing) accordingly to the time period between January 1, 2014 and
such later Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 7.06 shall be
made by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such other
party as may be designated by such other party. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that, for tax purposes, the Bayrol Profit Reimbursement
Payment 2013, or, as the case may be, the Bayrol Loss Reimbursement Payment
2013 will be treated as an adjustment of the Purchase Price for the Bayrol
Share as between the parties. Any payment required to be made by Bayrol,
German Seller or Buyer under this Section 7.06 that is not made when due
shall bear interest, compounded daily, at the rate set forth in
Section 2.05(b) for each day until paid.

  



  

Section 7.07. _Refunds and Remittances_. If Seller Parent, Sellers
or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, after the Closing Date receives any funds or
other property properly belonging to the other party or its Affiliates, the
receiving party will promptly so advise such other party and will promptly
deliver such funds or other property to an account or accounts designated in
writing by such other party.

Seller shall enter into a supply agreement at Closing with Bio-Lab for the
supply of bromine-based products in substantially the form attached as
Exhibit I hereto (the "Adrian Supply Agreement"). After the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, the parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to negotiate in good faith to reach reasonably mutually agreeable resolutions
on the matters noted as being open in the Adrian Supply Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.09. _Chemical Sweep_. Prior to the Closing, with respect
to the facilities of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, Seller Parent and
Sellers shall, or shall cause the Companies and/or the Subsidiaries to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to remove (i) Obsolete Inventory and
(ii) any "hazardous waste" as defined under applicable Environmental Law
(without regard to permissible storage periods under such law) and any other
waste generated from the manufacturing process, in each case other than such
hazardous or other waste as was generated in the ordinary course of business
within forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date (collectively, such
hazardous and other waste , the "Waste Materials"). Should any Waste Materials
or Obsolete Inventory remain at the facilities of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries as of the Closing, then Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare not later than six (6) months following the Closing Date
one or more written lists of Waste Materials and Obsolete Inventory that are
present as of the Closing Date at the facilities of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries ("Listed Materials"), which list(s) shall indicate the nature
and estimated quantity of each Listed Material with reasonable specificity.
Buyer shall provide such written list(s) to Sellers by the six (6) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, and commencing upon delivery of such list
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove and dispose of the Listed
Materials using a Qualified Vendor, such removal and disposal to be conducted
promptly and in a cost effective manner, and in compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws.  Within thirty (30) days following receipt of
commercially reasonable supporting documentation from Buyer, Seller Parent and
Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for the costs of such Qualified Vendor to
conduct such removal and disposal of such Listed Material.

consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that if such Tax Return is a consolidated, combined
or unitary Tax Return for a Seller Tax Group including entities other

a draft of the Tax Return prepared for the entire Seller Tax Group, Sellers
may deliver to Buyer for its review and comment a draft pro forma Tax Return
prepared for the Companies and Subsidiaries and (ii) at least (x) thirty (30)
days prior to filing any income Tax Return with respect to any Straddle Tax
Period and (y) ten (10) days prior to the filing of a non-income Tax Return
with respect to any Straddle Tax Period, Buyer shall deliver a draft thereof

statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by

be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in all aspects of such audits
or other proceedings and Sellers shall keep Buyer promptly informed of
progress thereof (including by providing copies of all correspondence in
connection therewith). Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such audits
or other proceedings without Buyer's prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall be entitled
to control all other audits and other proceedings in respect of Taxes of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, (x) Sellers shall be
entitled to participate, at its own expense, to the extent a proceeding could
reasonably be expected to give rise to an obligation on the part of Sellers

not settle or compromise any such audits or other proceedings without
Sellers' prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

shall jointly determine, acting reasonably, the amount of Taxes, interest and
penalties, if any, that are due to the Receiver General (Canada) in respect of
amounts required to be withheld and remitted by Bio-Lab Canada in respect of
the Crompton Canadian Debt, (such Taxes, interest and penalties owing in
respect of the Crompton Canadian Debt referred to as the "Canadian Tax
Liability"). Seller Parent and Sellers shall provide to Buyer all information
reasonably necessary to make its determination of such amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer's participation in the determination of the
Canadian Tax Liability shall not impact Seller Parent's or Sellers'
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(iii) for any unpaid
Taxes, interest and penalties in respect of the Crompton Canadian Debt. Each
of the parties shall bear their own expenses in connection with their
participation in the determination of the Canadian Tax Liability.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Sellers shall cause
Crompton or other Affiliates of Bio-Lab Canada to:

(e) Sellers shall deliver drafts of any proposed written
communications in respect of the Canadian Tax Liability with the Canada
Revenue Agency to Buyer for review prior to providing same to the Canada
Revenue Agency. Buyer shall promptly provide comments on such
communications to Sellers, and Sellers shall consider in good faith
reasonable comments of Buyer in respect of such communications. Each of
the parties shall bear their own expenses in connection with the review of
such communications.

  



  

(f) Buyer agrees to pay to Sellers, or cause to be paid to Crompton
(as the case may be) an amount equal to any refund of Taxes,
including interest and penalties, received by Bio-Lab Canada following the
Closing in respect of the Canadian Tax Liability.

  



  

Section 8.05. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. It is the intention of
the parties hereto that any amount paid by Sellers or Buyer under Section
7.06, this Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for tax purposes to the extent permitted by law. Any such
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be re-allocated in accordance with the
principles of Section 2.06. Any payment required to be made by Buyer or
Sellers under this Article 8 that is not made when due shall bear interest,
compounded daily, at the rate set forth in Section 2.05(b) for each day until
paid.

  



  

Section 8.06. _Survival._  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in Article 8

Section 9.01. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of 12 months
following the Closing Date, unless otherwise set forth in a collective
bargaining agreement applicable to any Continuing Employee, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) to,
provide to each Company Employee who is employed immediately prior to the
Closing Date and who remains in the employ of the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (each such individual, a "Continuing
Employee") a level of compensation and employee benefits substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the level of compensation and
employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date (excluding pension and retiree medical (in either case
except to the extent required to be provided to employees pursuant to
Applicable Law, a collective bargaining agreement or a works council
agreement), equity-based compensation (including phantom equity awards),
retention bonuses, and change-in-control benefits, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the 2013 discretionary performance-based 401(k) continuation

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Companies and the Subsidiaries) to, cause any employee benefit plans
covering any of the Continuing Employees following the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Buyer Plans") to recognize the service of each Continuing
Employee (to the extent such service was recognized by the Companies and their
Affiliates under the analogous Employee Plan or International Plan) for all
purposes of vesting eligibility and benefit accruals (but not benefit
accruals under a defined benefit pension plan), except to the extent that
such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period. Buyer shall cause each Buyer Plan to waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the analogous
Employee Plan or International Plan, and Buyer shall cause the Continuing
Employees to be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for amounts paid
prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing Date
occurs under an analogous Employee Plan or International Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms of
such Buyer Plan.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to continue
to credit under the applicable Buyer Plans each Continuing Employee for all
vacation and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to
use but has not used as of the Closing Date to the extent that (i) such
vacation and personal holiday pay is included as a Current Liability in
Closing Working Capital or (ii) solely with respect to any Continuing
Employee residing in the United States, (x) such vacation and personal holiday
pay was earned in that year in which the Closing Date occurs, or (y) to the
extent that the Closing Date occurs during the first calendar quarter of a
year, such vacation and personal holiday pay was rolled over from the year
preceding that year in which the Closing Date occurs and does not exceed ten
(10) days with respect to each such Continuing Employee, in each case subject
to the applicable Buyer Plan's terms and conditions relating to retention and
annual rollover of vacation and personal holiday time and Applicable Law.

  



  

(d) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Companies
shall establish a retention program for those key Company Employees
as determined by Buyer in consultation with Sellers (the "Retention
Program"), the terms and conditions of which are set forth in Schedule
9.01(d).

  



  

(e) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers shall provide Buyer with a true, complete and correct list of the
following with respect to each Company Employee and Company Consultant whose
annual base salary is equal to or less than $100,000: (i) with respect to
Company Employees located in the United States only, the name and
title/position, and with respect to Company Employees located outside of the
United States, an anonymous employee identification number, (ii) annual base
salary and (iii) target level of commission, bonus or other incentive
compensation; _provided_ that in no event shall Sellers be required to
disclose any information prohibited by Applicable Law.

Section 9.02. _Pension Plan Spinoff_. (a) Effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall establish and adopt a defined benefit pension plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and related trust
intended to be exempt from Federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code (such plan and trust, the "Buyer Pension Plan" and "Buyer Trust"),
to provide benefits to the individuals listed on Schedule 9.02 (and each
alternate payee or beneficiary of such person) ("Pension Transfer
Individuals") equivalent to those benefits accrued with respect to such
individuals under the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the "Seller
Pension Plan") through the Closing Date, and to accept the transfer of assets
and assumption of liabilities provided for in this Section 9.02. Effective as
of the completion of the transfer of assets provided for in Section 9.02(b),
(i) the Seller Pension Plan shall transfer to the Buyer Pension Plan, and the
Buyer Pension Plan shall assume and be responsible for, all liabilities of
the Seller Pension Plan for benefits accrued through the Closing Date in
respect of Pension Transfer Individuals who were participants in the Seller
Pension Plan before the Closing Date (the "Transferred Benefits"), (ii) Buyer
shall commence making the required benefit payments in respect of Pension
Transfer Individuals under the terms of the Buyer Pension Plan and (iii)
Seller Parent, Sellers and the Seller Pension Plan shall have no further
responsibility for the Transferred Benefits.

  



  

(b) As soon as administratively feasible after the Closing Date, but
in no event later than ten (10) days after the Closing Date, an
enrolled actuary who meets the qualification standards of the American
Academy of Actuaries to render such actuarial opinions (a
"Qualified Actuary") selected by Seller Parent (the "Seller Actuary") shall
determine the Transferred Benefits and the minimum amount that may be
transferred from the trust funding the Seller Pension Plan (the "Seller
Trust") to the Buyer Trust in compliance with Sections 411(d) and 414(1) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (collectively, the
"414(1) Requirements") and Section 208 of ERISA, determined using the
actuarial assumptions and methods set forth in Exhibit J (the "Pension
Transfer Amount") with respect to the Transferred Benefits.

  



  

(c) Within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall cause the Seller Pension Plan and Seller Trust to transfer cash or cash
equivalents to the Buyer Trust equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Pension
Transfer Amount (the "Initial Transfer Amount"), subject to compliance with
applicable notice requirements to any Governmental Authority.

  



  

(d) Within forty (40) days after the Closing Date, Seller Parent
will provide Buyer with (i) an updated calculation of the Pension
Transfer Amount (the "Final Transfer Amount") and (ii) all information
reasonably necessary for Buyer to review the calculation of the Final
Transfer Amount in all material respects and to verify that such calculations
have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement
(together, the "Pension Statement"). The determination of the Final
Transfer Amount by the Seller Actuary shall be final, conclusive and binding
for all purposes under this Agreement, unless Buyer provides to Seller
Parent, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Pension Statement, a
written objection prepared by a Qualified Actuary selected by Buyer (the
"Buyer Actuary") setting forth in detail a reasonable basis for the conclusion
that the Final Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement is
understated by an amount in excess of one percent (1%). Upon receipt of such
objection, Seller Parent and Buyer shall make a good faith attempt to resolve
their dispute as to the Final Transfer Amount. Should such dispute remain
unresolved for more than ten (10) days, Seller Parent and Buyer shall promptly
select and appoint a third Qualified Actuary (the "Third Actuary") who is
mutually satisfactory to both Parties. The Third Actuary shall recalculate
the Final Transfer Amount and if such recalculated amount exceeds the Final
Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement by more than one percent
(1%), then such recalculated amount shall serve as the Final Transfer Amount
for all purposes under this Agreement. If such recalculated amount does not
exceed the Final Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement by more
than one percent (1%), then for all purposes under this Agreement the Final
Transfer Amount shall be the Final Transfer Amount as set forth in the
Pension Statement. The recalculation of the Third Actuary shall be completed
within fifteen (15) days of the retention of the Third Actuary and shall be
conclusive as to any dispute with respect to the Final Transfer Amount.
The cost of the Third Actuary shall be divided equally between Sellers and
Buyer. Each Party shall be responsible for the cost of its own actuary.

(e) Within ten (10) days after the final determination of the Final
Transfer Amount (and the resolution of any disputes in accordance with clause
(d) hereof), Sellers, Seller Parent or Buyer, as applicable, shall cause an
additional transfer of cash or cash equivalents from the Seller Pension Plan
to the Buyer Pension Plan (or from the Buyer Pension Plan to the Seller
Pension Plan, as applicable) in an amount equal to the difference between (x)
the Initial Transfer Amount and (y) the Final Transfer Amount, as
appropriately adjusted to reflect (i) any reduction or increase in the
Transferred Benefits as a result of distributions and contributions
made under the Seller Pension Plan in respect of the Pension Transfer
Individuals between the Closing Date and the date of the
transfer contemplated by this Section 9.02(e), (ii) any earnings or losses on
the difference between the Initial Transfer Amount and the Final Transfer
Amount under the Seller Pension Plan between the Closing Date and the date of
the transfer contemplated by this Section 9.02(e), and (iii) any reduction in
the amount of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums attributable
to the Pension Transfer Individuals for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

  



  

(f) All such transfers pursuant to this Section 9.02 will be made in
accordance with the 414(l) Requirements.

  



  

(g) Buyer and Seller Parent shall cooperate in (i) making all
filings required under the Code or ERISA, (ii) implementing all
appropriate communications with Pension Transfer Individuals, (iii)
transferring appropriate records, and (iv) taking all such other actions as
may be necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this Section
9.02 in a timely manner.

  



  

(h) Buyer shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, file
an application with the IRS for a favorable determination letter
under Section 401(a) of the Code with respect to the Buyer Pension Plan, and
shall take any and all reasonable action, including the adoption of any
amendment requested by the IRS, as shall be necessary to obtain such
determination letter. The transfers under this Section 9.02 may be made prior
to, but shall be subject to the subsequent receipt of, a favorable
determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to the Buyer Pension
Plan, a copy of which shall be promptly furnished to Seller Parent upon
issuance. Buyer shall indemnify Seller Parent, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates in accordance with Article 11 against any Damages incurred by
Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates as a result of a
failure of the Buyer Pension Plan to constitute a qualified plan. Similarly,
Sellers shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates in accordance with Article 11
against any Damages incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates as a result of
a failure of the Seller Pension Plan to constitute a qualified plan.

(iv) Environmental Liabilities for which notice of such Damages is

 _provided_ that, with respect to indemnification by Seller Parent and
Sellers for inaccuracy in, misrepresentation with respect to or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller Parent or any Seller, other than a
misrepresentation or a breach of a Tax Representation, (each such inaccuracy,
misrepresentation and breach, a "Warranty Breach") or any Environmental
Liability, (a) Seller Parent and Sellers shall not be liable for any
individual Warranty Breach or Environmental Liability unless the amount of
Damages with respect to such Warranty Breach or Environmental Liability
exceeds $100,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"); _provided_ that related claims
and claims arising from the same underlying circumstances shall be treated as
a single claim for purposes of meeting the De Minimis Amount; (b) Seller
Parent and Sellers shall not be liable for Warranty Breaches (other than
Warranty Breaches of Section 3.21) unless the aggregate amount of Damages
with respect to such Warranty Breaches (together with Damages for

$4,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and then only to the extent such aggregate
amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches (but not Damages for
Environmental Liabilities and Warranty Breaches of Section 3.21, which are

Sellers shall not be liable for Environmental Liabilities or any Warranty
Breaches of Section 3.21 unless the aggregate amount of Damages with
respect to such Environmental Liabilities and Warranty Breaches of Section

the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Environmental Basket Amount; (d)
Seller Parent and Sellers shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate
amount of any Damages related to Warranty Breaches and Environmental

exceeds $31,500,000 but is less than $63,000,000; and (e) Seller Parent's and
Sellers' maximum liability for Damages related to all Warranty Breaches and
Environmental Liabilities shall not exceed $47,250,000 (the "Cap"); _provided,
further,_ that the calculations of the Basket Amount and the Environmental
Basket Amount shall not include Damages that are not in excess of fifty
percent (50%) of the De Minimis Amount (but shall include, for the avoidance
of doubt, Damages that are in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the De Minimis
Amount); _provided_ , _further_ , Seller Parent and Sellers shall not be
liable for Damages with respect to a Warranty Breach under Section 3.21 to
the extent such Damages are being indemnified hereunder as Environmental

be liable for any Damages relating to an Existing Litigation unless the
amount of Damages with respect to any such Existing Litigation exceeds $75,000
(the "Litigation Deductible Amount") and then only to the extent such amount

jointly and severally, hereby indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees and agree
to hold each of them harmless from and against any and all Damages incurred

each Seller and their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, partners, and members against and agrees to hold
each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered by Sellers
or any of their Affiliates based upon or arising out or incurred as a result
of any inaccuracy in, misrepresentation with respect to or breach of
representation or warranty of Buyer (each such inaccuracy, misrepresentation
and breach, a "Buyer Warranty Breach") or breach of covenant or agreement
made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (other than a
covenant or agreement made or to be performed pursuant to Article 8);
_provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Buyer Warranty
Breaches pursuant to this Section, (x) Buyer shall not be liable for any
individual Buyer Warranty Breach unless the amount of Damages with respect to
such Buyer Warranty Breach exceeds the De Minimis Amount; _provided_
that related claims and claims arising from the same underlying circumstances

under Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.06 or Section 4.07 (the "Buyer
Fundamental Representations" and each such misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, a "Buyer Fundamental Warranty Breach").

  



  

(f) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby (i) indemnifies
German Seller against and agrees to hold it harmless from any Damages
incurred by German Seller based upon or arising out or incurred as a result
of any obligation to provide security to any creditors pursuant to Section
303 German Stock Corporation Act as a result of the termination of the German
PLP Agreement to the extent that such obligation concerns liabilities of
Bayrol incurred after the Closing and (ii) agrees to provide a "back-to-back"
security in the form of a guarantee by Buyer to the German Seller up to an
aggregate amount of EUR 3,000,000 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L to
cover any security the German Seller is obliged to grant and has granted to
creditors of Bayrol pursuant to Section 303 German Stock Corporation Act as a
result of the termination of the German PLP Agreement but only if and to the
extent that the liability for which the security has been provided does not
result from and is unrelated to a breach of (i) any representations and
warranties of Sellers or Seller Parent, (ii) any covenants of Sellers or
Seller Parent, or (iii) any other obligation of Sellers or Seller Parent
under this Agreement. If any of the events set forth in items (i), (ii) or
(iii) in the preceding sentence occur after the relevant security has been
granted to the German Seller or become known to Buyer after such date, the
German Seller shall upon request of Buyer immediately return the relevant
"back-to-back" security to Buyer after having been provided with a revised
"back-to-back" security (taking into account any reduction in the amount
secured due to the occurrence of any of the events set forth in items (i),
(ii) or (iii)), if applicable.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount of a party's liability
for Damages under this Agreement, including for any breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Existing Litigation, Nine Month Labeling Claim,
Specified Matter, Seller Fundamental Warranty Breaches or Buyer Fundamental
Warranty Breaches and any amounts actually reimbursed under Section 7.09)
exceed the aggregate Purchase Price.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting any rights of
Buyer under Article 8, Sellers shall not be liable for Taxes in respect of a
Post-Closing Tax Period of the Companies and the Subsidiaries arising out of
a breach of the Tax Representations other than such Taxes that arise as a
result of a breach of the Tax Representations set forth in Section 3.22(f),
(i) and (l). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 11.02(h),
shall affect Sellers' indemnification obligations with respect to Taxes in
respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including interest, penalties additions
to Tax, and similar charges with respect to such Taxes).

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding Section 8.01(d) and Seller Parent's and Sellers'
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 11.02(a), the
Buyer Indemnitees shall (A) pay, or cause to be paid, to the German Tax
authorities up to $3,000,000 of any Tax of Bayrol due and payable after the
Closing in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Period that is attributable to the
challenge by German Tax authorities of Bayrol's transfer pricing of
transactions with Bayrol Iberica and Bayrol France SAS, as applicable, for the
2006 through 2009 taxable years (such Taxes of Bayrol, the "German Tax
Liability"), (B) be entitled to any and all Tax refunds received by
Bayrol Iberica or Bayrol France SAS, as applicable, within two (2) years of
Closing, in respect of adjustments of Tax attributable to the transfer
pricing of transactions with Bayrol for the 2006 through 2009 taxable years of
such entities, up to the amount paid by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
clause (A) of this Section 11.02(i) and (C) be indemnified under Section 11.02
for any German Tax Liability in excess of the refunds received by Buyer
pursuant to clause (B) of this Section 11.02(i). For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller Parent and Sellers are not obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
for the German Tax Liability to the extent Buyer received a refund of such
Taxes pursuant to clause (B) of this Section 11.02(i) and Seller Parent and
Sellers are entitled to any and all Tax refunds received by Bayrol Iberica or
Bayrol France SAS, as applicable, after the Closing in respect of
adjustments of Tax attributable to the transfer pricing of transactions with
Bayrol for the 2006 through 2009 taxable years of such entities in excess of
the refunds received by Buyer pursuant to clause (B) of this Section 11.02(i).
Section 11.02(a) and Section 8.01(d) shall apply to all Tax liabilities and
Tax refunds except as expressly set forth in this Section 11.02(i).

Section 11.03. _Third Party Claim Procedures_. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have adversely impacted the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such additional
information with respect to such Third Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 11.03(c), the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall be
entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at
its own expense.

  



  

(c) The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party within
fifteen (15) Business Days after having received any claim notice
with respect to whether or not it is exercising its right to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim; _provided_  that the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to control the defense of any
Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct
the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom and in
connection therewith to employ, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, one
counsel of its choice in each applicable jurisdiction (if more than
one jurisdiction is involved) to represent the Indemnified Party if (i) the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend a Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the required
time period of its election as provided in this Section 11.03(c), (iii) the
Third Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to result in Damages a
majority of which would be in excess of the amounts available for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 11, (iv) the Third Party Claim
principally seeks injunctive relief, (v) the Third Party Claim relates to
matters involving criminal conduct, (vi) the Third Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to impair, in any material respect, any
Indemnified Party's or its Affiliate's business or relationships with any of
such Person's material customers, suppliers, vendors or other service
providers, or (vii) the Indemnifying Party having timely elected to defend a
Third Party Claim, fails to diligently prosecute or pursue such defense, and
in each such case, the Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party Claim on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03 (when
entitled to make such election), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party (which counsel shall be subject to the approval of the
Indemnified Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) unless (A) such settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the applicable third party or
parties asserting the claim of all the Indemnified Parties and their
respective Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such Third Party Claim and (B) the settlement does not impose injunctive or
other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
or otherwise contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any
business by any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in the case of this clause (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party if the underlying claim for indemnification arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall
be paid by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that if under the applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict with respect to any
interests between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party exists in
respect of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of one (1) additional counsel as may be retained by such
Indemnified Party in order to resolve such conflict or to represent such
Indemnified Party in such Proceeding. Except as set forth in Section 11.03(d),
the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought
hereunder without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 11.03(c) within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of notice
of a Third Party Claim (when entitled to do so) or if the Indemnified Party
elects to control the defense when permitted to so do under Section 11.03(c),
then the Indemnified Party shall defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable
cost and expense in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, in
all appropriate proceedings. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party
shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of
such defense and proceedings _; provided, however_ , that the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnifying Party's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except in the case of claims the defense of
which the Indemnified Party elects to control pursuant to clause (iv) of the
first sentence of Section 11.03(c), consent to which settlements, compromises
or discharges may be withheld in the Indemnifying Party's sole discretion).
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim described in this Section 11.03(d) and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



    

89

--- 

    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Section 8.03 and
neither this Section 11.03 nor Section 11.06 shall govern the conduct of any
claim in respect of Taxes.

  



  

Section 11.04. _Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an
Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under Section 8.01 or Section
11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such
claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure shall have caused the Damages
(in whole or in part) for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be
greater than such Damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the
Indemnifying Party timely notice.

  



  

Section 11.05. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any
Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor (net of any (i) costs incurred in recovering such
amounts including the amount of any deductible paid and increased cost of
insurance and (ii) Net Tax Benefit, if any, actually realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Damages). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for
any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party from such insurance policy or other Person,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 8.01 or
Section 11.02 for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that
the Indemnified Party had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant
to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.05, (ii) Damages to the
extent that they are in the nature of (A) punitive Damages or (B)
consequential, special or indirect Damages, except, in the case of this
clause (B), to the extent such Damages are a reasonably foreseeable result of
the event that gave rise thereto or the matter for which indemnification is
sought hereunder, regardless of the form of action through which such Damages
are sought, except in each case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), to the
extent any such Damages are included in any proceeding by a third party
against such Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement or (iii) Damages relating to any matter (or underlying
set of facts) to the extent that the Indemnified Party has otherwise been
compensated for such Damages pursuant to a separate indemnification provision
in Section 8.01 or Section 11.02 or reimbursement provision in Section 7.09.

  



    

90 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Each Indemnified Party must use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this Agreement commencing at the time that the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of the loss for which indemnification is
sought, it being understood that the reasonable costs of such mitigation
shall constitute Damages hereunder.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers and Seller Parent and their respective Affiliates shall have
no liability under this Agreement for any Damages related to any
Environmental Matter to the extent (i) resulting from any sampling, testing
or other invasive investigation of the air, soil, surface water, groundwater,
building materials or other environmental media, or any disclosure, report,
or communication relating to any Environmental Matter to any Governmental
Authority or other third party, unless such sampling, testing, investigation,
disclosure, report or communication is required by Applicable Law
or Environmental Law, is in response to a request from a Governmental
Authority, or is otherwise necessary to respond to any Third Party Claim
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii) resulting from any shutdown,
other than routine maintenance, or closure of any asset, facility or real
property on or after Closing, except to the extent that such shutdown or
closure is necessary as a direct result of any violation of Environmental Law
by, or any Release by, any Company or any Subsidiary occurring prior to
the Closing Date; or (iii) exceeding those Damages that must be incurred to
satisfy, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the minimum requirements of a
Governmental Authority under applicable Environmental Law, using, where
possible risk-based standards, engineering, use or institutional controls or
deed or other restrictions.

  



  

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of Damages under this
Article 11 arising out of a Warranty Breach by Seller Parent or any
Seller and for purposes of determining the occurrence of a Warranty Breach,
the representations and warranties of Seller Parent or such Seller set forth
in this Agreement (other than Section 3.10(a) and Section 3.11(b)) or any
certificate or other writing related thereto that are qualified as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or any other similar materiality
qualification shall be deemed to not include any such qualification.

  



  

Section 11.06. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party
receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages
pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all
or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential
Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall, upon request of the Indemnifying Party,
assign to the extent permissible such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to assign any
right to proceed against a Potential Contributor if the Potential
Contributor is a Governmental Authority or if such assignment would
reasonably be expected to impair, in any material respect, the
Indemnified Party's or its Affiliate's business or relationships with any of
such Person's material customers, suppliers, vendors or other service
providers or if it would adversely affect the right of any Indemnified Party
to recover under any insurance policy.

Section 11.07. _Exclusivity_. Buyer, Seller Parent and Sellers
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, the indemnification
provisions in this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
of any party with respect to any and all claims arising out of or
in connection with breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, other than claims for fraud or
willful misconduct. Nothing in this Section 11.07 shall prevent or prohibit a
Party from seeking and/or obtaining specific performance in accordance with
Section 13.12.

  



  

Section 11.08. _No Right of Contribution_. None of Seller Parent or
any Seller shall, and none of their respective Affiliates shall, have any
right of contribution against any Company or any Subsidiary, or any of any
Company's or any Subsidiary's respective former, current, or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, controlling persons,
management companies or representatives for any claim (including any Third
Party Claim) asserted by any Buyer Indemnitee under this Article 11.

  



  

Section 11.09. _Effect of Knowledge or Waiver of Condition_. The
right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedies based on any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or in any document delivered with respect hereto will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to or any knowledge or
information acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (other than disclosures
made in the Disclosure Schedules). The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer waives and shall cause its Affiliates to waive any
rights and claims (for contribution or otherwise) arising under any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect) that Buyer or its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries)
may have against Seller Parent, Sellers or their respective Affiliates,
whether in law or in equity, relating to the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries or the Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby.

consummated on or before the first Business Day of a month first
occurring after the five (5) month anniversary of the date hereof (the
"Termination Date"); _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) during the
Marketing Period; _provided_ ,  _further_ , the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the
Closing to occur by such time; _provided, further_ , in the case of an
Extended Closing, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 12.01(b) shall not be available to either party between the date the
conditions set forth in Article 10 are first satisfied and the first Business
Day after the date on which the Extended Closing is scheduled to occur;
_provided,_ _further_ , that if on the Termination Date, any of
the conditions set forth in Article 10 are not satisfied due solely to any
Regulatory Law applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, and all of
the other conditions set forth in Article 10 are satisfied (other than the
Closing Date Conditions, _provided_  that the Closing Date Conditions would
reasonably be expected to be satisfied at Closing if Closing were to occur on
the Termination Date), then either Seller Parent or Buyer shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, by providing written notice to the
other party, to extend the date referred to above in this clause (b) for a
period not to exceed three (3) months (a "Regulatory Extension"); _provided,_
_further_ , in the event of a Regulatory Extension, notwithstanding the first
proviso of this Section 12.01(b), either Sellers or Buyer shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement, in addition to any other
termination rights under this Section 12.01(b), if the Closing shall not have
been consummated before the nine (9) month anniversary of the date hereof;

  



  

(c) by either Sellers or Buyer if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or
judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction;

  



  

(d) by Buyer, if a breach by Seller Parent or Sellers of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement shall have occurred, which breach, in the aggregate with all other
such breaches, if any, would give rise to a failure of the condition set
forth in Section 10.02(a) and which is not cured by the 15th Business Day
following written notice to the party committing such breach given reasonably
promptly after Buyer becomes actually aware of such breach; _provided,_
_however,_  Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 12.01(d) if Buyer is then in material violation or breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions contained in Section 10.01
and Section 10.03 not to be satisfied;

  



  

(e) by Sellers, if a breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall have
occurred, which breach, in the aggregate with all other such breaches, if
any, would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section
10.03(a) and which is not cured by the 15th Business Day following written
notice to Buyer given reasonably promptly after Sellers become actually aware
of such breach; _provided,_ _however,_ no Seller shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(e) if any Seller is
then in material violation or breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions contained in Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 not to be
satisfied; or

  



    

93 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(f) by Sellers, if (i) all the conditions set forth in Section 10.01
and Section 10.02 have been satisfied (other than any condition the failure
of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Buyer of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein and
other than the Closing Date Conditions, each of which is, as of such date,
capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Buyer shall have failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the time
required pursuant to Section 2.02(a); and (iii) Sellers and Seller Parent
have irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing that all conditions in
Section 10.01 and Section 10.03 have been satisfied (other the Closing Date
Conditions, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or
that Sellers and Seller Parent are willing to waive such unsatisfied
condition(s) and that each Seller and Seller Parent is irrevocably committed
to consummate the Closing at such time.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01
(other than Section 12.01(a)) shall give notice of such termination to the
other party.

  



  

Section 12.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without
liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; _provided_ that, subject to the limitations in Section 12.03, if
such termination shall result from fraud or the willful and intentional (a)
failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party, (b) failure to perform a covenant of this
Agreement or (c) breach by either party hereto of any representation or
warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for
any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of
such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 6.01, 12.03, 13.01, 13.03,
13.05, 13.06 and 13.07 and this Section 12.02 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.

  



  

Section 12.03. _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12.01(f), then Buyer shall
promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter (the
"Payment Date"), pay or cause to be paid to Sellers an amount equal to
$18,000,000 (the "Reverse Break-Up Fee") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Sellers (it being understood that
in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Reverse Break-Up Fee on more
than one occasion).

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 12.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 12.03(a) on or prior to the Payment Date, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Sellers commence an action that results in a judgment
against Buyer for the amount set forth in Section 12.03(a) or any portion
thereof, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Sellers interest on such
amount at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received and Sellers' costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) in connection with such action (any interest, fees and
expenses collectively, "Enforcement Expenses"). If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 12.01, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement and without limiting the right of Sellers and
Seller Parent to seek specific performance in accordance with Section
13.12(b), the payment of the Reverse Break-Up Fee pursuant to Section 12.03(a)
and the payment of the Enforcement Expenses, if any, shall, except in
connection with the enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreement, be the sole
and exclusive remedy (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the remedy of
specific performance in accordance with Section 13.12(b)) of any Company, any
Subsidiary, Sellers, Seller Parent any of their respective Affiliates and any
Representatives of any of the foregoing, against Buyer, its Affiliates, any
Financing Source and any of their respective former, current, or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, officers,
agents, employees, advisors, controlling persons, management companies or
representatives (the "Buyer Parties") for any losses suffered or incurred
relating to, arising under, in connection with, resulting from or otherwise
as a result of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without limitation,
as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the Financing Letters or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby to be consummated whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Without limiting the right of Sellers and Seller Parent to
seek specific performance in accordance with Section 13.12(b), upon payment
in full of the Reverse Break-Up Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, (i)
no Buyer Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to,
arising under, in connection with, resulting from or otherwise as a result of
out of or in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
including the Financing Letters or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (ii) except in connection with the
enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreement, none of Sellers, Seller Parent,
any Company, any Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim against any Buyer
Party relating to, arising under, in connection with, resulting from or
otherwise as a result of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement including
the Financing Letters, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith or any matter forming the basis for any termination hereof or
thereof whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section
12.01, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including this Section 12.03), (i) under no circumstances will any Company,
any Subsidiary, Sellers, Seller Parent, any of their respective Affiliates or
the representatives of any of the foregoing seek or be entitled to any damages
or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the remedy of specific performance in accordance with
Section 13.12(b) prior to the termination of this Agreement), including
special, consequential, indirect and punitive damages for any losses
suffered or incurred relating to, arising under, in connection with,
resulting from or otherwise as a result of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including, without limitation, as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated herein or in the Financing Letters to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder or for any
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, in any case, in excess of the amount of the Reverse Break-Up Fee
and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, and (ii) under no circumstances will
any Company, any Subsidiary, Sellers, Seller Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or the representatives of any of the foregoing be permitted or
entitled to seek or enforce a grant of specific performance of Buyer's
obligation to consummate the Closing and/or receive any monetary damages
under this Agreement, the Financing Letters or otherwise after any of such
parties receive the Reverse Break-Up Fee and the Enforcement Expenses (if
any). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this Section 12.03), (x) the only circumstance in which the Reverse Break-Up
Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, will be payable by Buyer (or, to
the extent provided in Section 13.13, Buyer Guarantor) is set forth in
Section 12.03(a), and (y) Sellers are the only Persons to whom the Reverse
Break-Up Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, may be paid. Each Seller
and Seller Parent acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery
against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any Buyer Party (other
than Buyer (or, to the extent provided in Section 13.13, Buyer Guarantor) to
the extent provided in this Agreement, subject to Section 13.12, the Equity
Funding Letters or the parties subject to the Confidentiality Agreement),
through Buyer or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer against any Equity Provider or any
other Buyer Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, or otherwise,
except for its rights to recover from (x) an Equity Provider (but not any
other Buyer Party (including any general partner or managing member)) under
and to the extent provided in, subject to Section 13.12, the Equity Funding
Letters, and subject to the other limitations described therein or (y) the
Buyer Guarantor in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, Section
13.13.

  



  

(d) Each Seller and Seller Parent acknowledges that (i) the
agreements of Buyer contained in this Section 12.03 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where the Reverse Break-Up Fee and any Enforcement
Expenses are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 12.03 are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Sellers and Seller Parent for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and in reliance on this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained
in Section 12.03, Sellers and Seller Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement.

further,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign any or all of

sources solely for collateral purposes, however no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer of any Liability hereunder.

regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States

parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,

Beneficiaries_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures

other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance

materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order

acknowledge and agree that (a) the Schedules to this Agreement may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by Sellers of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by
Sellers that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement or that the matter is material.

Section 13.12. _Specific Performance_. (a) The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, subject to the
following sentence, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of
Seller Parent and Sellers to obtain specific performance to cause Buyer to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Section
13.12(b).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Seller Parent and Sellers shall have the right to seek specific
performance to cause Buyer to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only if: (i) all
of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 and Section 10.02 have been
satisfied (other than any condition the failure of which to be satisfied is
attributable to a breach by Buyer of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein and other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of
which is, as of such date, capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii)
the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing has been funded or would be
funded at the Closing, if the Equity Financing were funded at the Closing and
(iii) Sellers and Seller Parent have irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in
writing that (A) all conditions in Section 10.01 and Section 10.03 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of
being satisfied at the Closing) or that Sellers are willing to waive such
unsatisfied condition(s) and (B) if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing were funded, each Seller and Seller Parent
is irrevocably committed to consummate the Closing upon the occurrence of
such funding and will take such actions as are required by them under this
Agreement in order to cause the consummation of the Closing to occur.

  



  

Section 13.13. _Buyer Parent Guaranty_. (a) To induce Sellers to
enter into this Agreement, Buyer Guarantor hereby unconditionally, absolutely
and irrevocably guarantees, undertakes and promises, as a primary obligor and
not merely as a surety, the due and punctual performance by Buyer of all
covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities and amounts to be paid
contained in this Agreement, including all monetary obligations, including
Buyer's obligation to pay the Purchase Price, Buyer's obligation to pay the
Reverse Break-Up Fee, Buyer's obligation to indemnify Sellers or any of their
Affiliates and other fees, costs and expenses, whether primary, secondary,
direct, indirect, contingent, fixed or otherwise, but in all events subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement (all such obligations as now or
hereafter in existence being collectively, the "Obligations"). Buyer
Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations of Buyer may be amended,
extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further
consent or assent from it, and no such amendment, extension or renewal will
discharge or otherwise affect any Obligation of Buyer Guarantor under this
Agreement.

  



    

100 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If Buyer fails to meet the Obligations when due under this
Agreement, then Sellers or their Affiliates may, at their option and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, take any and all
actions available hereunder or under applicable law to collect the
Obligations from the Buyer Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Buyer Guarantor acknowledges that Sellers or their Affiliates may, in their
sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against the
Buyer Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations, regardless of whether
any action is brought against Buyer.

  



  

(c) The guaranty pursuant to this Section 13.13 (i) is a guaranty of
payment, and not of collection, (ii) is absolute and unconditional and shall
not be impaired, discharged or terminated by any act or omission by Buyer that
may affect the enforceability of a guaranty, (iii) shall not be affected by
(1) the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding or
inability to pay of Buyer or of any other party, (2) the failure of Sellers
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against
Buyer or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (3) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of
the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, the Equity Funding Letters, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Credit Facility or any other agreement
evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the
Obligations; (4) the addition, substitution or release of any other Person
interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (5) any change
in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (
_provided_ that any such change, rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation
or other amendment or modification shall be subject to the prior written
consent of Buyer to the extent expressly required by this Agreement); (6) the
adequacy of any other means Sellers or their Affiliates may have of obtaining
payment of the Obligations; or (7) any discharge of the Buyer Guarantor as a
matter of Applicable Law (other than a discharge of the Buyer Guarantor as a
result of payment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement or as a result of defenses to the payment of the Obligations that
would be available to Buyer under the Agreement).

  



  

(d) Buyer Guarantor in its capacity as a guarantor of the
obligations of Buyer set forth in this Section 13.13, hereby expressly waives
notice of acceptance, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and
all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that Sellers exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against Buyer.

  



    

101 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) If Buyer Guarantor makes a payment or performs an action under
the guarantee contained in this Section 13.13 in satisfaction of
any Obligation of Buyer, such satisfaction shall be deemed to be a
satisfaction of such Obligation by Buyer for purposes of this Agreement. In
the event that any payment to Sellers or their Affiliates in respect of any
Obligations is rescinded or is otherwise returned by Sellers to the payor
thereof for any reason whatsoever, the Buyer Guarantor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to such Obligations as if such payment had not been
made.

  



  

(f) The Buyer Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Sellers
that:

  



  

(i) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization;

  



  

(ii) it has all necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have
been duly authorized by all necessary action and no other proceedings or
actions on the part of the Buyer Guarantor are necessary therefor and that the
execution, delivery and performance by the undersigned of this Agreement do
not and will not (i) violate the organizational documents of the Buyer
Guarantor, (ii) violate any applicable Law or judgment, order or decree of a
Governmental Authority or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation, any
contract to which the undersigned is a party, in any case, for which the
violation, default or right would be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation by the
Buyer Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a
timely basis;

  



  

(iv) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Buyer Guarantor enforceable against the Buyer Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Equitable Exceptions; and

  



  

(v) the Buyer Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform
its obligations under this Agreement, and all funds necessary for the Buyer
Guarantor to fulfill its Obligations under this Agreement until the earliest
of (x) the Closing Date, (y) valid termination of this Agreement or (c)
payment to the Buyer of the full amount of the Obligations.
