Closing Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing Statement shall disregard any and
all effects on the Company and its Subsidiaries (including their respective
assets and liabilities) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to
the calculation of the Transaction Expenses) or of any financing or
refinancing arrangement entered into at any time by Buyer or any other

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) After delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, Buyer and the Company
shall cooperate with and shall provide the Equityholder Representative and
its authorized officers, employees and professional advisors with reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice, to the
books and records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents) and supporting data of Buyer and the Company used in connection
with the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, provided that such actions
do not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of Buyer

Equityholder Representative and its authorized officers, employees and
professional advisors keep any such information confidential in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_.

(c) On or prior to the date that is forty-five (45) days following the
Equityholder Representatives receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (such
period, the " _Review Period_ "), the Equityholder Representative may object
to any calculation contained in the Post-Closing Statement by delivering
to Buyer a written statement setting forth any such objection in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item, the basis for its disagreement
therewith and the dollar amount of each such disagreement (the " _Statement
of Objections_ "). If the Equityholder Representative fails to deliver the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Post-
Closing Statement shall constitute the Final Closing Statement for purposes of
this Agreement, and the calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon shall
be deemed to have been accepted by the Equityholder Representative and shall
be deemed final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any calculation set forth
in the Post-Closing Statement as to which the Equityholder Representative
does not object in the Statement of Objections will be deemed accepted by the
Equityholder Representative and will be final and binding upon all parties
hereto upon delivery of the Statement of Objections.

 



-18- 

    

(d) If the Equityholder Representative delivers the Statement
of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and the
Equityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each
objection set forth in the Statement of Objections within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (such period, as may be
extended by written agreement of Buyer and the Equityholder Representative in
their respective sole discretions, the " _Resolution Period_ "), and in
connection with such good-faith negotiations, each of Buyer and the
Equityholder Representative shall provide the other party and its authorized
officers, employees and professional advisors with reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice, to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and
supporting data of such party prepared or reviewed in connection with the
preparation the Post-Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections, and,
if each item in the Statement of Objections is resolved by written agreement
of Buyer and the Equityholder Representative within the Resolution Period, the
Post-Closing Statement, modified to reflect such changes as have been agreed
in writing by Buyer and the Equityholder Representative with respect to the
items set forth in the Statement of Objections, shall constitute the Final
Closing Statement, and the calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon (as
so modified), shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. All
discussions related to such negotiations within the Resolution Period shall
(unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Equityholder Representative in their
respective sole discretions) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence (in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and similar state rules.
If the Equityholder Representative and Buyer fail to reach an agreement with
respect to all of the matters properly set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then Buyer and the
Equityholder Representative shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within ten (10) days following the end of the Resolution Period refer
any calculation remaining in dispute (the " _Disputed Amounts_ ") for
resolution to Deloitte and Touche LLP (provided that if such person is unable or
unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Equityholder Representative and Buyer
shall work in good faith to jointly select an alternative firm that is a
nationally or regionally recognized independent accounting firm) (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "). Buyer and the Equityholder Representative will
execute a customary engagement letter with the Independent Accountant, will
cooperate with the Independent Accountant during the term of its engagement,
and will provide the Independent Accountant, at the time of such engagement,
with the Post-Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections. The
Equityholder Representative and Buyer shall also furnish the Independent
Accountant with such other information and documents as the Independent
Accountant may reasonably request in order for it to resolve the Disputed
Amounts. Buyer and the Equityholder Representative will request that the
Independent Accountant, within thirty (30) days of its referral, make a final,
written determination as to the Disputed Amounts. Neither Buyer nor the
Equityholder Representative nor any of their respective Representatives shall
have or conduct any communication, whether written or oral, with the
Independent Accountant without the other party either being present or
concurrently receiving a written copy of any such communication. Neither
Buyer nor the Equityholder Representative will disclose to the Independent
Accountant, and the Independent Accountant will not consider for any purpose,
any settlement discussion or settlement offer made by or on behalf of Buyer or
the Equityholder Representative, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer
and the Equityholder Representative. The Equityholder Representative and Buyer
will instruct the Independent Accountant to only resolve the Disputed Amounts
and the 

 



-19- 

    

 decision of the Independent Accountant for each Disputed Amount must be
within the range of values assigned to such Disputed Amount in the Post-
Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively. The
Independent Accountant shall act as expert, and not as arbitrator, Buyer and
the Equityholder Representative shall instruct the Independent Accountant to
make its determination based solely on written submissions by Buyer and
the Equityholder Representative to the extent such submissions are in
accordance with this Agreement and only in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The Post-Closing
Statement, as modified based on any applicable agreement of the Equityholder
Representative and Buyer and the determination of the Independent Accountant
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(d)_ with respect to the Disputed
Amounts, shall constitute the Final Closing Statement for purposes of this
Agreement, and the calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon will be
final and binding upon all parties, on the date the Independent Accountant
delivers its final determination in writing to Buyer and to the Equityholder
Representative. The final determination of the Independent Accountant shall be
enforceable to the same extent as an arbitral award pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(e) The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant incurred in
the resolution of the Disputed Amounts shall be allocated and paid by Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders, severally among the Equityholders based on their Pro Rata
Percentages), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the Disputed Amounts so submitted to the Independent Accountant that
is unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of the Disputed Amounts
submitted to the Independent Accountant.

(f) No later than five (5) Business Days after the Purchase Price has
been finally determined based on the Final Closing Statement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.07_ (such final determination, the " _Final Purchase Price_
"), (x) the Equityholder Representative shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Buyer the Payment Allocation Schedule (reflecting any updated
Pro Rata Percentages as may be necessary after taking into account the payment
of the Closing Payment Amount and the deemed payment of the exercise price in
respect of each Option) and (y) the following actions shall be taken and
payments shall be made, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account (or accounts) specified in writing by the Equityholder Representative
or Buyer, as applicable:

 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price (the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, the " _Positive Adjustment Amount_ ": (A) Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Equityholders based on their respective Pro Rata
Percentages an amount equal to the lesser of the Positive Adjustment Amount
and the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and (B) within the five (5) Business Day
period following the determination of the Final Purchase Price, Buyer and the
Equityholder Representative shall deliver or cause to be delivered a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire Adjustment Escrow
Amount to the Company (for further payment to the Optionholders pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.07(h)_) and the Sellers in respective amounts based on their
respective Pro Rata Percentages.

 



-20- 

    

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price (the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final
Purchase Price, the " _Negative Adjustment Amount_ ", within the five (5)
Business Day period following the determination of the Final Purchase Price,
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to release (A) to Buyer an
amount equal to the lesser of the Negative Adjustment Amount and
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and (B) to the Company (for further payment to
the Optionholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07(h)_) and the Sellers in the
aggregate the funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account
immediately following the disbursement to Buyer pursuant to the foregoing
clause (A) (if any), in respective amounts based upon their respective Pro
Rata Percentages.

 

(iii) If the Final Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price,
no adjustment payment shall be made. In such instance, within the five (5)
Business Day period following the determination of the Final Purchase Price,
Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver or cause to be
delivered a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire
Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Company (for further payment to the
Optionholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07(h)_) and the Sellers in
respective amounts based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Sellers
agree that (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of
Buyers right to any Purchase Price adjustment contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 2.07_, and that in no event shall the Equityholders be liable other
than as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(f)_ to the extent that any such
Negative Adjustment Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and
(ii) the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be used solely in connection with and
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.07(g)_, and for no other purpose.

 

(h) To the extent any portion of (i) the Positive Adjustment Amount (if
any) is payable by Buyer for the benefit of the Optionholders pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_, or (ii) the Adjustment Escrow Amount is released
from the Adjustment Escrow Account for the benefit of the Optionholders
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.07_, such portion of the Positive
Adjustment Amount or the Adjustment Escrow Amount, as the case may be, shall
be paid or delivered to the Company (or such other Affiliate of Buyer as
determined by Buyer) for payroll processing and distribution, at the next
administratively practicable payroll date following receipt by the Company or
such other Affiliate of Buyer, of each Optionholders respective Pro Rata
Percentage of such portion of the Positive Adjustment Amount or the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, as the case may be, subject to _Section_ __ _
2.07(i)_.

 

(i) Any compensatory payment under this Agreement, including with respect
to holders of Options with respect to such Options, shall be subject to (i)
in the case of a payment in respect of Options, receipt of a duly executed
Option Cancellation Agreement from the Optionholder of such Options and (ii)
withholding and Tax reporting, and all such withholding and Tax reporting
shall be effectuated by use of the payroll system of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 



-21- 

    

(j) Buyer and the Sellers shall treat any payment of the
Positive Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Sellers as
additional Purchase Price for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and any payment
of the Positive Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the
Optionholders as a compensatory payment for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules (and subject to _Section_ __ _

operations of such Subsidiary. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, power and
authority to own, lease and operate their respective properties and assets and
to carry on their respective businesses as they are now being conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of its
and each of its Subsidiaries respective Organizational Documents, together
with all amendments and modifications thereto, each as in effect as of the
date hereof. Each such Organizational Document is in full force and effect,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in default under, or in
violation of, any of the provisions of its respective Organizational

contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is or will be a party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and no additional corporate proceeding on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by

enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

modification, cancellation, notice, consent, waiver, purchase or sale of, or
result in the triggering of any payment or in the imposition of a Lien
(other than a Permitted Lien) upon any of the respective properties or assets
(including rights) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to, any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (or by
which any of their respective properties or assets (including rights) are
bound or affected) or any Permit held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, with respect to _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , as would

the payment of any transfer and gain taxes, and (ii) where the failure
to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits of, or to make
such filings, registrations with or notifications to, any Governmental Entity
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A)
result in material Liability to the Company or such Subsidiary or (B)
prevent, materially delay or materially impair, the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction Document to
which it is or will be a party or consummate the transactions contemplated

the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any of its employees, and to the
knowledge of the Company, any Representative or any other person acting on

to cause a violation of Sanctions. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

pending, or to the Companys knowledge, threatened, with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan or the assets of any fiduciary thereof (in such persons

Section 6.05 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance_.

Company and its Subsidiaries to, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law (but solely to the extent and scope provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof pursuant to their respective
Organizational Documents or any indemnification or similar Contract to which
the Company is a party as of the date hereof), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each current or former director or officer (or equivalent) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims,
damages or Liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, in respect of any threatened, pending
or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, based on or arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing) to the extent that they are based
on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
(or equivalent) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (the "
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "); _provided_ that none of Buyer, the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries of the Company shall be liable for any settlement
effected without Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of any
Indemnified Liability, the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements
therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon
request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

 

(b) _Insurance_. At the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Company to (at
Sellers expense) obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Closing for events occurring prior to the Closing (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable in the aggregate to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the Companys and/or its Subsidiaries existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy.

 

(c) _Priority_. With respect to any right to indemnification or
advancement for acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Closing to
which an Indemnified Party who was, prior to the Closing, a Representative of
Seller Two designated by Seller Two to serve as a member of the board of
directors of the Company (a " _Seller Two Indemnified Party_ ") is entitled
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall be the indemnitor of first resort, responsible for all such
indemnification and advancement that such Seller Two Indemnified Party may
have from any direct or indirect shareholder or equity holder of the Company
(or any Affiliate of such shareholder or equity holder) and without right to
seek subrogation, indemnity or contribution. Each of Buyer and the Company
further agrees that no advance or prepayment by any party other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the primary indemnitor on behalf of any
such Seller Two Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which such
Seller Two Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing and that any such secondary
indemnitor shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement or payment to all the rights of recovery of the
Seller Two Indemnified Party against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-59- 

    

(d) _Successors_. In the event the Company or Buyer or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Company or Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.05_.

(e) _B_ _enefit_. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or
her Representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
parties hereto and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to any Indemnified Parties (including their successors,
assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including
the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

(f) _Survival of Indemnification_. For a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall provide to the Indemnified
Parties the same rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses as provided to the Indemnified Parties under the provisions of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and provided to Buyer prior to the Closing,
and the Companys and its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents shall not
contain any provisions contradictory to such rights.

(g) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_,
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ is not prior to, or
in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 6.06 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing and for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Closing (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "), Buyer shall
provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries,
to provide each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing (including employees who are not actively at
work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) (each, a "
_Company Employee_ ") with annual base salary or hourly wages, as applicable,
bonus or incentive compensation opportunity, and benefits (excluding any
change-in-control compensation, defined benefit eligibility, and retiree
health and welfare coverage, but including health insurance) that
are substantially comparable in value, in the aggregate, to the compensation,
opportunities and benefits provided to a similarly situated employee of Buyer
or one of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the extent that a Company Employee is located outside
of, or primarily provides services outside of, the United States, such Company
Employee shall be entitled to compensation and benefits required by applicable
Law.

 



-60- 

    

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, take such
corporate action as is necessary to cause the Company Benefit Plan qualified
under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing, subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall provide, or cause to
be provided that, (i) all benefit accruals under the Company 401(k) Plan will
be frozen and no new participants will be admitted to the Company 401(k) Plan
on or after the Company 401(k) Plan termination date, (ii) any contribution
due to the Company 401(k) Plan (including any participant elective
contribution and any matching contribution related thereto) in respect of any
period prior to, but not yet paid as of, the Company 401(k) Plan termination
date will be contributed by the Company as soon as administratively feasible
following the Company 401(k) Plan termination date, and (iii) all Company
401(k) Plan participant accounts will be one hundred percent (100%) vested
effective on the Company 401(k) Plan termination date. The Company shall
provide to Buyer, prior to the Closing Date, written evidence
reasonably acceptable to Buyer of the adoption by the applicable authorized
governing body of the Company 401(k) Plan of resolutions authorizing the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan (and the form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to Buyers prior review and consent). In
addition, in connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Buyer
or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
permit each Company Employee who was participating in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing to begin participating in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, subject to the eligibility
requirements applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates as of the Closing, and, in connection therewith, Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall take all steps reasonably necessary to permit
each Company Employee who was participating in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing to begin participating in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, subject to the eligibility
requirements applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates as of the Closing.

 

(c) Each Company Employee shall receive service credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under any employee benefit plans
sponsored by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including the
Company and its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee is eligible to
participate on and following the Closing. To the extent that any
Company Employee participates in any health or group welfare benefit plan of
Buyer or one of its Affiliates following the Closing, Buyer, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods, and (ii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which
such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to provide, notices and continuation coverage for each Company Employee
and each spouse or dependent of a Company Employee who is an "MandA Qualified
Beneficiary" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



-61- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein (i) shall be
treated as an amendment of or an undertaking to amend any Company Benefit
Plan; (ii) is intended to confer any third-party rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or Liabilities hereunder upon any person (including,
without limitation, any director, officer or employee and any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; or (iii) is intended to confer upon any Company
Employee any right to continued employment or service with Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries).

 

Section 6.07 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

Section 6.08 _Transfer Taxes_. All real property transfer, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer, registration, recording, and stamp and
any similar Taxes and fees that become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together, with any related
interests, penalties or additions to Tax, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the
Equityholders (as Closing Date Indebtedness). The party responsible under
applicable Law for filing any Tax Return and other documentation with respect
to any Transfer Tax shall prepare and timely file all such Tax Returns and
other documentation, and each other party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with respect to the preparation and filing of such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

Section 6.09 _Seller One Indemnity_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller One shall indemnify, reimburse and
hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), and their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, members, managers, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or
relating to, and promptly reimburse all expenses incurred in defending
against, or with respect to the defense of, any Action with respect to or
arising from, the matters set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ of the
Disclosure Schedules (the " _Specified Matter_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller Ones obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall extend to
any Loss incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any Indemnified
Liabilities required to be paid by a Buyer Indemnitee to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ to the extent arising out of, in connection
with, or relating to the Specified Matter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, even if a Buyer Indemnitee would
otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.09_, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller One pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall be an amount equal to the portion of the Final
Purchase Price actually paid to Seller One.

 

(b) The right of any Buyer Indemnitee to seek indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall terminate sixty (60) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for any cause of action that may be
asserted with respect to the Specified Matter (the " _Survival Date_ "),
except with respect to any pending claim submitted pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.09_ prior to the applicable Survival Date.

 



-62- 

    

(c) In order for a Buyer Indemnitee to seek indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_, such Buyer Indemnitee (or Buyer on behalf of such Buyer
Indemnitee) shall notify Seller One in writing reasonably promptly after such
Buyer Indemnitee receives notice of the occurrence of the event giving rise
to Buyer Indemnitees claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable
detail (to the extent practicable) the basis of such claim (the " _Specified
Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent) that Seller One is
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days of Seller Ones receipt of a Specified
Claim Notice, Seller One shall deliver written notice stating (i) that Seller
One agrees to indemnify Buyer Indemnitee in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 6.09_ with respect to each matter contained in the Specified Claim Notice
(an " _Indemnification Acceptance Notice_ "), or (ii) that Seller One
disputes in good faith the Buyer Indemnitees assertion that Seller One is
obligated to indemnify such Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any such
claim, including a reasonable description of the basis for such good faith
dispute (an " _Indemnification Dispute Notice_ "). If Seller One fails to
deliver an Indemnification Acceptance Notice or an Indemnification Dispute
Notice to the Buyer Indemnitee within the ten (10) Business Day period
following its receipt of a Specified Claim Notice, Seller One shall be deemed
to have irrevocably agreed to indemnify Buyer Indemnitee for the Losses
arising out of, in connection with or relating to each claim set forth in the
Specified Claim Notice.

(e) If Seller One delivers an Indemnification Dispute Notice within the
ten (10) Business Day period following receipt of a Specified Matter Notice,
Seller One and Buyer Indemnitee will engage in good faith negotiations to
resolve each such dispute for a period of ten (10) Business Days after
deliver of the Indemnification Dispute Notice (such ten (10) Business Day
period, as may be extended in writing by the Buyer Indemnitee and Seller One,
the " _Claim Negotiation Period_ "). If Seller One and the Buyer Indemnitee
do not execute a written agreement resolving each dispute included in the
Indemnification Dispute Notice within the Claim Negotiation Period, then
either Seller One or the Buyer Indemnitee may seek to have such dispute
resolved through litigation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ of this
Agreement. The prevailing party in any such litigation shall be entitled to
recover its reasonable costs and fees in connection with such litigation,
including reasonable attorneys fees.

(f) If any Action is threatened or commenced by any person against a Buyer
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or relating to the Specified
Matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), in addition to delivery of a Specified
Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim, such Buyer Indemnitee
will deliver to Seller One, reasonably promptly (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days) after such Buyer Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of
all material notices and documents (including court papers) received by such
Buyer Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis will not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that Seller One is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

(g) In the event of a Third Party Claim, Seller One will be entitled to
participate in (but not control) the defense thereof at Seller Ones sole cost
and expense; _provided_ , that a Buyer Indemnitees right to control its
defense in a Third Party Claim shall not be determinative of the amount of
any Loss which may be subject to this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_. All parties
hereto (including Seller

 



-63- 

    

 Two) shall reasonably cooperate in good faith in the defense or prosecution
of such Third Party Claim, including providing all records and information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis, during normal business hours and on
reasonable prior notice, to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall require any party to

Buyer or any of its Representatives is required to or reasonably believes that
it is required by Law to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such
party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Company with
prompt written notice of any such requirement so that the Company may seek (at
its cost and expense) a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the
event that such protective order or other appropriate remedy or waiver by the

make any disclosure of the Confidential Information to which Buyer gives its
prior written consent, (ii) disclose any of such information to such Sellers
or its Affiliates Representatives who need to know such information and who
are advised of the confidentiality obligations that attach to the Confidential
Information (it being agreed that such Seller will be responsible for any
violation of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_ by any of its
Affiliates or its or their Representatives), and (iii) disclose that
information which, on the advice of counsel, is required to be disclosed by

its or their Representatives in violation of this Agreement). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in the event that a Seller or any
of its Representatives is required to or reasonably believes that it is
required by Law to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such party
shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt written
notice of any such requirement so that Buyer may seek (at its cost and
expense) a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the event that
such protective order or other appropriate remedy or waiver by Buyer is not
obtained or granted, and such Seller or its Representative is nonetheless, on
the advice of counsel, required by Law to disclose Confidential Information,
such person may disclose to, or as required by, the applicable Governmental
Entity only that portion of the Confidential Information that such counsel
advises is legally required to be disclosed (and any such disclosure shall be
made only to such persons to whom such counsel advises such information is
legally required to be disclosed); _provided_ that each Seller and their
respective Representatives shall exercise reasonable best efforts (at their

(18) month period prior to the Closing Date for purposes of diverting such
clients or customers use of services of the Business from Buyer or its

(d) The nature and scope of the foregoing provisions have been carefully
considered by Buyer and each Seller. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that
the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ are essential elements
of this Agreement and that, but for these covenants, Buyer would not have
agreed to acquire the Shares or otherwise become party to this Agreement.
Buyer and each Seller hereby agree and acknowledge that the duration, scope
and geographic areas applicable to such provisions are fair, reasonable and
necessary under the circumstances existing at the date of this Agreement and
that adequate compensation has been received by such Seller for its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_. If, however, for any reason any
court determines that any such restriction is not reasonable or that the
consideration made available with respect to such restriction is inadequate,
such restriction shall be interpreted, modified or rewritten to include as
much of the duration, scope and geographic area identified in this _Section_
__ _ 6.13_ as will render such restrictions valid and enforceable, and the
other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, the non-breaching
party shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond or other security, to
an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, and a breaching
party acknowledges the inadequacy of relief in damages with respect thereto.

any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach.

Date, each of the parties hereto shall execute such documents and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required or desirable to put Buyer in
operating control of the assets, properties and business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, to assist Buyer in exercising all rights
with respect thereto and to carry out the purpose and intent of this
Agreement. Each party shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take
such other actions to ensure that, to the extent within its control or
capable of influence by it, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be fully carried out in a timely fashion.

Section 10.02 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Closing. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 10.03 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.02_,
waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Annexes, Exhibits, Disclosure Schedules and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto and
supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 10.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto; _provided_ that Buyer may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement without such consent to any Affiliate of
Buyer, which assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.
Any assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be
void.

 



-75- 

    

Section 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. Except for: (a) _Section 6.05_,
which shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs,
executors or administrators and his or her Representatives, (b) _Section
6.09_ , which shall be for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees, (c)
_Section 10.14_ , which shall be for the benefit of the Prior Company Counsel,
(d) _Section 10.15_, which shall be for the benefit of the Non-Party
Affiliates and (e) _Section 10.16_ which shall be for the benefit of the
Released Parties, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third-
party beneficiary thereof, the parties hereto hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third-party beneficiaries under  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, _Section_
__ _ 6.09_, _Section_ __ _ 10.14_, _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ and _Section_ __ _
10.16_ shall not arise unless and until the Closing occurs. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ without notice or Liability
to any other person.

 

Section 10.08 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings; Disclosure
Schedules_.

 

(a) Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement,
which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between
the parties hereto. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For
purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: (i) the singular
number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (ii) the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; (iii) the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and (iv) the neuter
gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this
Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and words of similar meaning,
shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated,
all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits," are
intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits
to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to
refer to U.S. dollars. All references in this Agreement to "" or "EUR" are
intended to refer to Euros (the currency of the member states of the European
Union). For purposes of determining the applicability of any provision of
_Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_ to any Contract containing payment terms denominated
in, or otherwise involving payment or other consideration in any currency
other than U.S. dollars, the relevant amount of such other currency shall be
converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate applicable to such
other currency as published by the Wall Street Journal as of the Business Day
immediately prior to the date hereof. For purposes of determining
the applicability of, or compliance with, any provision of _Article VI_ which
contains an amount expressed in U.S. dollars with respect to any matter
involving any currency other than U.S. dollars, the relevant amount of such
other currency shall be converted into U.S. dollars based on the exchange
rate applicable to such other currency as published by the Wall Street Journal
on the relevant date of determination. The term "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive and shall have the meaning commonly ascribed to the term "and/or",
and the words "will" and "will not"

 



-76- 

    

 are expressions of command and not merely expressions of future intent or
expectation, in each case, unless the context otherwise requires. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. References herein to "as of the date hereof," "as
of the date of this Agreement" or words of similar import shall be deemed to
mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or following which any act is to be done or step is to be taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business
Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any
action required to be taken "within" a specified time period following the
occurrence of an event shall be required to be taken by no later than 11:59
p.m. local time in New York City on the last day of such time period. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean "if". The phrase
"ordinary course of business" means, with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries, the ordinary and usual course of day-to-day operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with past practice. Any Contract,
instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
whether or not so specified. All documents and agreements relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that have been posted, at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the date hereof, to the electronic data room
established by or on behalf of the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to have been "delivered",
"provided" or "made available" (or any phrase of similar import) to Buyer by
the Company.

 

(b) The information in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes (i) exceptions
or qualifications to representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
of the Sellers and the Company as set forth in this Agreement or (ii)
descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in
this Agreement. Any disclosure made in any Schedule to this Agreement
numbered to correspond to any Section of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ shall
be deemed to be a disclosure made with respect to the representations and
warranties in any other Section of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other representations or warranties is
reasonably apparent on its face notwithstanding the absence of an appropriate
cross-reference. The Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as
indicating that any disclosed information is required to be disclosed, and no
disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such information is
material to, or required to be disclosed by, the Sellers or the Company. The
Sellers and the Company may, at their option, include in the Disclosure
Schedules items that are not material, and such inclusion, or any references
to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms (including Company
Material Adverse Effect) for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure on the
Disclosure Schedules relating to a possible breach or violation of any
Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that a
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The Disclosure Schedules
constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated into this Agreement
for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules that are not defined therein shall have the meanings
given them in this Agreement.

Section 10.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any disputes arising
from or relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, enforcement,
or enforceability of this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including all Actions (whether in contract or in tort, at
law or in equity, or granted by statute) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any principles of conflicts of Law that would require the application of the
Laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.10 _Venue_. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought by any other party or
its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any appropriate
state or federal court located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York and any
appellate courts therefrom, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself
and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard
to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto agrees not
to commence any Action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above in New York City in the Borough of Manhattan, other
than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment,
decree or award rendered by any such court in New York City as described
herein. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, any claim (a) that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve
process, and any such process may be served by any permitted means of notice
under _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ (other than email), (b) that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such courts is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial and Certain Damages_. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.11_.

 



-78- 

    

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in.pdf format shall be sufficient to bind
the parties hereto to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur to a party if any provision of this Agreement
were breached or not performed by the other party in accordance with the terms
hereof. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination hereof,
each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
the other party hereto and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy, at law or in equity, to
which it is entitled. Each party further agrees that (a) no such party will
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief as provided herein on the basis that the other party has an adequate
remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity and (b) no other party or any other
person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.13_, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

Section 10.14 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Buyer and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries)
covenants and agrees that, following the Closing, DLA Piper LLP (US) (the "
_Prior Company Counsel_ ") has acted as legal counsel to the Sellers, the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of and performance under this Agreement and
acknowledges and agrees that, following consummation of the Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, Prior Company Counsel (or any of its
successors) may serve as counsel to the Sellers and their Affiliates in
connection with any Action, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, notwithstanding such prior representation of
the Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer hereby consents to such
future representation of Sellers and their Affiliates by Prior Company Counsel
and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom and Buyer shall cause
any of its Affiliates to consent to and waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates and Representatives, including the Company following the
Closing, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications created or exchanged prior to the Closing between, and all
other documents created prior to Closing for the purpose of rendering or
facilitating legal advice by, (i) the Sellers and/or Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of Affiliate(s) of any of the foregoing and/or (ii) Prior
Company Counsel, in each case, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of and performance under, or any dispute
or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any
of the foregoing, do not lose any status they may have as attorney-
client privileged documents or work product (collectively, the " _Seller
Privileged Documents_ ") by reason of this Agreement, any other Transaction
Document, or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and, from and after Closing, the
Seller Privileged Documents and

 



-79- 

    

 any legal privilege(s) or similar protections applicable to such documents
are deemed to be the sole property of the Equityholder Representative, and,
from and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit its
Affiliates or Representatives to, claim that any such privilege has been
waived as to the Seller Privileged Documents by reason of this Agreement, any
other Transaction Document, or any other agreement contemplated hereby
or thereby or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Buyer, the Company, or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third-party, not including the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, Buyer or the Company
will either assert any privilege necessary to prevent the disclosure of Seller
Privileged Documents to such third party or will provide Sellers with
sufficient advance notice of the potential for each specific disclosure and
sufficient opportunity to appear and defend such privilege and prevent such
disclosure at the sole cost of Sellers.

 

(b) Each Seller hereby acknowledges, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and other Representatives that Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") has acted as legal counsel to Buyer in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of and
performance under this Agreement and acknowledges and agrees that, following
consummation of the Sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Fried
Frank (or any successor) may serve as counsel to Buyer, the Company and any
Affiliates of Buyer in connection with any Action, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, notwithstanding such
prior representation of Buyer. Each Seller hereby consents to such
future representation of Buyer and its Affiliates by Fried Frank and waives
any conflict of interest arising therefrom and each Seller shall cause any of
its Affiliates to consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising from
such representation. Each Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and other Representatives, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications created or exchanged prior to the Closing
between, and all other documents created prior to Closing for the purpose of
rendering or facilitating legal advice by, Buyer and/or Fried Frank, in each
case, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of and performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out
of or relating to, this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or thereby or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, do not lose
any status they may have as attorney-client privileged documents or work
product (collectively, the " _Buyer Privileged Documents_ ") by reason of this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document, or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or thereby or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and are
deemed to be the sole property of Buyer, and, from and after the Closing, such
Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates or other Representatives
to, claim that any such privilege has been waived as to the Buyer Privileged
Documents by reason of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, or any
other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

Section 10.15 _Limitation on Recourse_. Subject to the terms thereof, this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract, in tort, at law, in equity or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, termination, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly

 



-80- 

    

 identified as parties hereto (but only to the extent of the specific
obligations of such parties set forth herein). No person who is not a named
party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future officer,
director, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, management
company, member, stockholder, equity holder, controlling person,
Representative or Affiliate, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor
or assign of any of the foregoing, of any named party to this Agreement ("
_Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in
tort, at law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
Liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
Liability based on, in respect of, by reason of, arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.15_ shall absolve any non-party to this Agreement of
liability for any constructive or actual fraudulent transfer or other scheme
to prevent the enforcement of any judgment or award against any party to this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.16 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually occurs),
each Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries and each of its
past, present or future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
equity holders, controlling persons, Representatives or Affiliates, or any
heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Releasing Parties_ "), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and each of the foregoings respective past, present or
future officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, management companies, members, stockholders, equity holders,
controlling persons, Representatives or Affiliates, or any heir, executor,
administrator, successor or assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Seller Released Parties_ ") of and from any and all actions, causes of
action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues,
accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and
claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity (whether based upon
contract, tort, contribution or otherwise) which the Releasing Parties may
have against each of the Released Parties, now or in the future, in each case
in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of
the Released Parties in any capacity related to the Company or its
Subsidiaries occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing Date (including
any and all Affiliate Arrangements terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.11_), but only to the extent that such cause, matter or thing does not
constitute fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.16(a)_ shall release any claims (i) arising
from the rights or obligations of any person under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or with respect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or (ii) with respect to fraud or liability arising from a
criminal act of a Seller Released Party.

(b) Effective as of the Closing (but only if the Closing actually occurs),
Buyer, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries) and each of its past, present or future
officers, directors, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers,
management companies, members, stockholders, equity holders, controlling
persons, Representatives or Affiliates, or any heir, executor, administrator,
successor or assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Buyer
Releasing Parties_ "), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and
forever discharges each Seller and their respective Affiliates

 



-81- 

    

 (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), and each of the foregoings
respective past, present or future officers, directors, employees, agents,
general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, Representatives or
Affiliates, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Buyer Released Parties_ ") of and from
any and all actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions,
judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants
(whether express or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether
in law or in equity (whether based upon contract, tort, contribution or
otherwise) which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released
Parties, now or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or
thing relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any actions taken or
failed to be taken by any of the Released Parties in any capacity related to
the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or arising on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, but only to the extent that such cause, matter or thing
does not otherwise constitute fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.16(b)_ shall release any
claims (i) arising from the rights or obligations of any person under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) with respect to fraud or
liability arising from a criminal act of a Buyer Released Party.

Section 10.17 _Several Obligations_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the obligations of each of the Sellers under this Agreement shall be
several and not joint.

 

Section 10.18 _Equityholder Representative_. Seller Two is hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally appointed as the representative of the
Equityholders (such Seller in such capacity, the " _Equityholder
Representative_ "). Pursuant to such appointment, the Equityholder
Representative shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Equityholders to
(a) make all decisions permitted to be exercised by any Equityholder by the
Escrow Agreement, including any decision relating to the distribution of any
amount payable to Buyer or the Equityholders under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and the exculpation or release of the Escrow Agent, (b) give
and receive all notices required to be given by or to an Equityholder or
either of the Sellers under or delivered pursuant to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, (c) take any and all additional action as is
contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers or any other
Equityholder by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (d)
administer the defense or settlement of any dispute regarding the Purchase
Price adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ or any other claim or
dispute for and on behalf of the Equityholders under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, (e) amend, alter or waive any provision of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the other Equityholders and (f)
determine the allocation among the Equityholders of any amount payable to the
Equityholders under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement ( _provided_ that
such determination shall be made in accordance with the Payment Allocation
Schedule of the Company, the Company Option Plan and any other applicable
