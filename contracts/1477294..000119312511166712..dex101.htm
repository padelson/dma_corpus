resolve their differences with respect thereto within 20 Business Days after
the Purchasers receipt of Elexs Objection Notice. If Elex and Purchaser

Statement within such 20 Business Day period, then the Preliminary Working
Capital Statement, with such modifications necessary to reflect such agreement
of Elex and the Purchaser, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and

be resolved by an Independent Accounting Firm jointly retained by Elex and
the Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm shall make a determination only
on the Disputed Amount as well as such modifications, if any, to the
Preliminary Working Capital Statement necessary to reflect such
determination, and the same shall thereafter be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties, except as provided by applicable law. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm for any item in dispute cannot, however, be in
excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed
for that particular item in the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, in the
case of Purchaser, or in the Objection Notice, in the case of Elex. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the
Parties as follows: Elex shall pay a percentage of the fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm equal to: (i) the difference, if any, between
Elexs estimated value of the Final Net Working Capital as submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm and the Independent Accounting Firms final
determination of Final Net Working Capital divided by (ii) the Disputed
Amount. The Purchaser shall pay the remaining percentage, if any, of the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm, (it being understood that in
the event the Final Net Working Capital is equal to the Preliminary Net
Working Capital determined by a Party (as submitted to arbitration by such
Party), the other party shall pay all fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm). The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to
render its decision in accordance with the terms hereof, including the
Specified Accounting Policies.

documents prepared by the Sellers or their accountants and other advisors

requested by the Sellers accountants and other advisors) and to finance
personnel of the Sellers and their representatives and any other information
which the Purchaser reasonably requests, and the Sellers shall cooperate
reasonably with the Purchaser and its representatives in connection therewith.



   3.2.5 | No later than 20 Business Days after the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, as evidenced by its written acceptance by
facsimile or otherwise to the Parties, each of Elex and the Purchaser shall
submit a brief to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy to the other
party) setting forth their respective positions regarding the issues in
dispute. No later than 20 Business Days after submission of the initial
brief, each of Elex and Purchaser shall submit a reply brief (with a copy to
the other party). The Independent Accounting Firm shall render its decision
resolving the dispute within 30 Business Days after submission of the last
reply brief. If additional briefing, a hearing, or other information is
required by the Independent Accounting Firm, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall give notice thereof to the Parties as soon as practicable before the
expiration of such 30 Business Day period, and the Parties shall promptly
respond with a view to minimising any delay in the decision date.

Purchaser the amount of such deficit.

the amounts, if any, owed by them, as the case may be, under sub-clause 3.2.6,
together with interest thereon from the Completion Date to the date of
payment at a rate of 1.3% per annum, in immediately available funds, to a bank
account designated by the other party no later than 5 Business Days after the
Final Net Working Capital has been agreed to or deemed to be agreed to by
Elex and the Purchaser or has been delivered by the Independent Accounting
Firm.

   3.2.8 | Within 30 Business Days following the determination of any
excess or deficit in accordance with this Clause 3.2, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall revise the purchase price allocation to reflect such excess,
deficit or payment in accordance with the nature of each relevant excess,
deficit or payment, consistent with the proportional allocation of value as
described in _Schedule 9_ ( _the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ ).

If any payment is to be made by any Seller to the Purchaser in respect of any
claim for breach of this Agreement, the payment shall be made by way of
adjustment of the consideration paid by the Purchaser for the Shares under
this Agreement, which shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of
such payment.

Precedent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
satisfied the Condition Precedent set out in paragraph 2.2(xi) of Part A of
_Schedule 2_ ( _Conditions Precedent_ ) if the Sellers have used best efforts
to satisfy such Condition Precedent. The Sellers shall use best efforts to
satisfy or procure the satisfaction of paragraph 4 of Part A of _Schedule 2_

of the Sellers attention.

additional information from, the Competition Authorities, and shall comply
promptly with any such inquiry or request. Neither party shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Competition Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiries unless it consults with the
other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Competition
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Clause 4.2.4 shall be
construed as requiring the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to divest or

take any other such steps to the extent that such actions would have an
adverse effect on the Purchaser, the Sensor-Nite Group Companies or any of the
Purchasers Affiliates.

paragraphs 2 and/or 4 ( _The Sellers and/or Corporate information_ ) of
_Schedule 5_ ( _The Warranties_ ) and, in the event of any Claim in relation
to the Warranties in paragraphs 2 and/or 4 ( _The Sellers and/or
Corporate information_ ) of _Schedule 5_ ( _The Warranties_ ), the Sellers

   8.3.2 | Any notice served by the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 8.3.1

the time, the legal and factual basis of the Claim, and, if reasonably
practicable, the amount likely to be claimed. 
---|--- 



   8.4 | _Monetary limits_ 
---|--- 



   8.4.1 | Subject to Clause 8.4.4, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
recover any amount in respect of any individual Claim (or series of Claims
arising from substantially the same facts or circumstances) unless the amount
recoverable in respect of such Claim (or series of Claims) exceeds Euro
75,000, in which event, subject to Clause 8.4.2, the whole amount of such
Claim (or series of Claims) shall be recoverable and not merely the excess. 
---|--- 



   8.4.2 | Subject to Clause 8.4.4, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
recover any amount in respect of any Claim unless the amount recoverable in
respect of such Claim, when aggregated with the amount of all other Claims in

---|--- 



   8.4.5 | For purposes of determining whether a breach or a violation of
any Warranty has occurred, each Warranty shall be read and construed to
include all materiality, "in all material respects" and other qualifiers
expressly set forth in the applicable representation or warranty. However, the
determination of the amount of a Loss resulting from a breach of any Warranty
of the Sellers shall be made by disregarding and not giving effect to any
qualifiers as to "materiality", "in all material respects", or words of
similar import, and instead interpreting such Warranty as if such terms were
deleted. 
---|--- 
 



34 ---|--- 



   8.5.1 | If the matter or circumstance giving rise to (i) any Claim, or
(ii) any claim with respect to the liability described in item 3 of Schedule 7
( _Specified Liabilities_ ), is a result of, or connected with, a claim by or
liability to any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Purchaser shall
be entitled, in its reasonable opinion, to take such action as it shall deem
reasonably necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal,
compromise or contest such claim or liability (including, without limitation,
making counterclaims or other claims against third parties) but shall, so far
as practicable, without prejudice to the rights of the Purchasers insurers,
consult with the Sellers in connection with any such action and give due
consideration to any reasonable recommendations of the Sellers. 
---|---

     | (b) | the Purchaser shall consult with the Sellers with respect to
instructing lawyer(s) to represent the Sensor-Nite Group Companies in
connection therewith; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | no settlement shall be agreed with the claiming third party
without prior consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except if the Purchaser can demonstrate that not
offering or accepting the settlement will cause disproportionate damage to the
commercial interests of the Sensor-Nite Group Companies. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8.6 | _Fraud_ 
---|--- 

None of the limitations contained in Clauses 8.3 and 8.4 shall apply to any
Claim that arises or is increased, or is delayed, as a result of, fraud,
dishonesty, wilful misconduct or wilful concealment on the part of any Seller
or any of its representatives, agents or advisers.



   8.7 | _Recovery from third parties_ 
---|--- 



   8.7.1 | The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
in respect of any Claim if and to the extent the Purchaser or the Sensor-Nite
Group actually receive payment with respect to the Losses arising from such
Claim from an insurance policy in force at or after the Completion Date (after
deduction for any Tax, cost of collection, deductible, retroactive premium
adjustment, reimbursement obligation or other cost or expense directly
related thereto) (an " _Insurance Payment_ "). If the Sellers make an
indemnification payment to the Purchaser for Losses as required under this
Agreement, and subsequently the Purchaser or the Sensor-Nite Group 
---|--- 
 



35 Purchaser shall pay or procure the payment to the Sellers of (x) if the amount
of such indemnification payment is equal to or greater than the amount of the
Insurance Payment, the full amount of the Insurance Payment or (y) if the
amount of such indemnification payment is lower than the amount of the
Insurance Payment, a portion of the Insurance Payment equal to the amount of
such indemnification payment. 
---|--- 



   8.7.2 | If the Sellers have paid an amount in discharge of any Claim,
and the Purchaser or any Sensor-Nite Group Company recovers from a third party
a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser or Sensor-Nite Group
Company (in whole or in part) for the same Losses which are the subject matter
of such Claim and that were actually indemnified by the Sellers, the Purchaser
or the relevant Sensor-Nite Group Company shall pay to the Sellers as soon as
practicable after receipt of such sum an amount equal to: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | the sum recovered from the third party in respect of such
Losses less any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery and
less any Taxation attributable to the recovery; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if less, the amount previously paid by the Sellers to the
Purchaser less any Taxation attributable to it. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8.7.3 | The Purchaser shall not be concerned with the apportionment
between the Sellers of any amounts paid pursuant to Clauses 8.7.1 or 8.7.2. 
---|--- 
 



   8.8 | _Tax savings_ 
---|--- 

In calculating amounts payable hereunder by the Sellers to the Purchaser with
respect to a Loss, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be computed net
of any Tax benefit actually received by a Sensor-Nite Group Company (and which
has reduced or eliminated a liability of the relevant Sensor-Nite Group
Company to make a payment of or in respect of Tax) with respect to such Losses
in the year of the indemnity payment or a prior year, but increased by the
amount of any Tax detriment actually incurred by the Purchaser or a Sensor-
Nite Group Company as a result of such partys receipt of the indemnification
payment with respect to such Loss.



   8.9 | _Contingent Losses_ 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of
any Loss which is contingent until and to the extent such Loss is actually
incurred. A Loss which will arise only if certain conditions materialise shall
be considered a contingent Loss for the purposes of this Clause 8.9 unless
and until the relevant conditions materialize or it becomes likely that they
will materialise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Clause 8.9
shall not have the effect of preventing the Purchaser from making a Claim in
respect of contingent Losses if such a Claim is made within the time limits
specified in Clause 8.3.

 



36 ---|--- 

The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of
any Losses to the extent that such Losses are the direct result of any action
taken by the Sellers prior to Completion or pursuant to this Agreement, in
either case, at the express written request of the Purchaser.



   8.11 | _Mitigation of Losses_ 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken to avoid or
mitigate any Losses which might give rise to a Claim under the Warranties
against the Sellers, to the extent required to do so by applicable law.
