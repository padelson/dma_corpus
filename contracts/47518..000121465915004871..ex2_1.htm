MERGER SUB CORP., a New York corporation ("Sub"), and WELCH ALLYN HOLDINGS,
INC. (formed as WELCH ALLYN CORPORATION in New York), a New York corporation
(the "Company").

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have adopted this Agreement and approved the merger (the "Merger") of Sub into
the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby (i) Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation and (ii) each issued share of
common stock - Class A, no par value per share, of the Company (the "Company
Class A Common Stock") and each issued share of common stock - Class B, $.01
par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Class B Common Stock" and,
collectively with the Company Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common
Stock"), in each case not owned by Parent, Sub, or the Company, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the
State of New York (the "NYBCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
Welch Allyn Holdings, Inc. The term "Transactions" shall mean (i) the Merger
and (ii) the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New
York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day following the
date of satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all
parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any
condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth
in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived
by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (a) a date during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days'
notice to the Company and (b) the date that is three Business Days after the
final day of the Marketing Period. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, Parent, Sub and the
Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter the Surviving Corporation shall file with the Department of State
of the State of New York, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the NYBCL and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the NYBCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and
the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
906 of the NYBCL.

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation of Sub in the form attached hereto as Annex A shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective
Time until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. The bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 1.08. Plan of Merger. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
merger" with respect to the Merger for purposes of the NYBCL.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

  

 

  

ARTICLE II 
 

  

  

Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of
Certificates

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company, Parent, Sub or any Company Subsidiary and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest, to be paid in accordance with Sections
2.04(b) and 2.02(d) and the Escrow Agreement. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
following the surrender of such certificate to receive Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.04(b) and 2.02(d) and the Escrow
Agreement, in each case without interest.

  

  

(d) Dissenting Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a
holder who has not voted to adopt this Agreement or assented thereto in
writing and has the right to demand and has properly demanded payment of the
fair value of such shares by filing a written notice of such holder's election
to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section 623 of the NYBCL
("Section 623") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 623 and Section 910 of the NYBCL
("Section 910"); provided, however, that if any such holder fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to dissent under Section 623
and Section 910, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished and converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c),
without interest thereon. The Company shall serve prompt written notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for dissenting of any shares of
Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the NYBCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Merger Consideration Adjustment. (a) Estimated Merger
Consideration Adjustments. Not less than two Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good-faith
estimate which shall set forth (i) the estimated amount of Cash and Cash
Equivalents as of the Close of Business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date minus the amount of any cash dividends or distributions to
holders of Company Common Stock on the Closing Date prior to the Closing
("Estimated Cash"), (ii) the estimated amount of Indebtedness outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing ("Estimated Indebtedness"), (iii) the
estimated amount of Other Adjustments as of immediately prior to the Closing
("Estimated Other Adjustments") and (iv) the estimated Net Working Capital as
of the Close of Business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date
("Estimated Net Working Capital"), in each case calculated in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as in effect as
of the date hereof ("GAAP"), applied in a manner consistent with the
principles, policies and methodologies used by the Company in the preparation
of the Financial Statements and (B) in the case of Estimated Net Working
Capital, in a manner consistent with the calculation of Estimated Net Working
Capital as set forth on Schedule A. GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with
the principles, policies and methodologies used by the Company in the
preparation of the Financial Statements and in a manner consistent with the
calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital are referred to in this Agreement
as the "Balance Sheet Principles".

  

  

(b) Closing Statement. No later than 75 days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause to be prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Principles and
delivered to the Shareholder Representative a closing statement (the "Closing
Statement") and a certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth
Parent's calculation of (i) the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Close of
Business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date minus the amount of
any cash dividends or distributions to holders of Company Common Stock on the
Closing Date prior to the Closing ("Closing Cash"), (ii) the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing ("Closing
Indebtedness"), (iii) the Other Adjustments as of immediately prior to the
Closing ("Closing Other Adjustments") and (iv) the Net Working Capital as of
the Close of Business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Closing Net Working Capital").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Disputes. (i) If the Shareholder Representative disagrees with the
Closing Statement or Parent's calculation of any of Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(b), the Shareholder Representative may,
within 45 days after receipt by the Shareholder Representative of the Closing
Statement, deliver a notice to Parent providing reasonable detail of the
reason for any disagreement and setting forth the Shareholder Representative's
calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify all
items or amounts with which the Shareholder Representative disagrees, and the
Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items

Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working
Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(b). Subject to Parent's compliance

Representative shall be deemed to have agreed to all items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Cash,

the Shareholder Representative and its independent accountants reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for any purpose relating to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 2.02, subject to the Shareholder Representative's entrance into a
customary confidentiality agreement with the Company's independent accountants
(if required thereby) provided that the Shareholder Representative and its
accountants shall have no such right to receive copies of or have access to
Parent's or the Company's internal correspondence or analysis to the extent
they relate to a matter in dispute between the Shareholder Representative and
Parent or the Company.

  

  

(iii) If a notice of disagreement is delivered in accordance with this Section
2.02(c), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall, during the 30 days
following such delivery, seek in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net
Working Capital. At the end of such period, if the Shareholder Representative
and Parent are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly cause Ernst
and Young LLP, or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in
writing by the Shareholder Representative and Parent (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Referee") to review the
relevant portions of this Agreement, the Closing Statement and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital. In
making such calculation, the Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement and Parent's calculation of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working
Capital as to which the Shareholder Representative has disagreed in a notice
of disagreement delivered in accordance with this Section 2.02(c). The Referee
shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 30 days from the date of engagement of
the Referee), a report setting forth its calculation of the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working
Capital; provided, however, that the Referee may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by one of the parties, in
the case of Parent, in the Closing Statement or in the case of the Shareholder
Representative, in the notice of disagreement delivered in accordance with
this Section 2.02(c). The costs and expenses of the Referee shall be borne in
the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted to the Referee that are unsuccessfully disputed by
Parent, on the one hand, and the Shareholder Representative, on the other
hand, as finally determined by the Referee, bears to the total dollar amount
of such remaining disputed items so submitted.

to (A) whether the Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Principles with respect to the matters that were submitted for
resolution to the Referee and (B) whether there were mathematical errors in
the Closing Statement. The Referee is not authorized to, and shall not, make
any other determination, including (A) any determination with respect to any
matter included in the Closing Statement or the notice of disagreement that
was not submitted for resolution to the Referee, (B) any determination as to
whether GAAP was followed for the Audited Balance Sheet or the Interim Balance
Sheet, (C) any determination as to whether the Target Net Working Capital was
properly calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet Principles, (D) any
determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.06 or any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement, (E) any determination as to compliance by the
Company, Sub, Parent or Shareholder Representative with any of its covenants
in this Agreement, other than Section 2.02(c)(ii), or (F) any matter relating
to the Financial Statements.

  

  

(v) The dispute resolution by the Referee under this Section 2.02(c) shall
constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and shall
not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Referee as to any
issue within its authority shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith
or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Referee in New York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced.

(e) No Liability. None of the parties or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

  

  

(f) Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment made hereunder, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or under any provision of Federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld from any payment,
(i), such withheld amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority and (ii) such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company and the Shareholder Representative shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, cooperate in good faith to minimize any withholding that may
apply to any payments described in this Section 2.04(f), including by the
provision of any Tax forms or documentation that demonstrate the recipient's
eligibility for an exemption from or reduction of withholding. Before making
any such deduction and withholding with respect to the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock, the paying party shall give the payee party notice of
its intention to make such deduction and withholding at least 10 days prior to
the date on which such deduction or withholding is expected, in order for the
payee party to obtain a reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. Parent is not aware of any amounts that are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock as of the date hereof.

  

  

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) No Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Section 2.04, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of shares
of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the volume weighted average price per share of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by Bloomberg
L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually
selected by Parent and the Company) for the period commencing at the opening
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the eleventh day prior to the
Closing Date and ending at the close of trading on the second successive
complete trading day prior to the Closing Date.

cash payment equal to the LTIP Cash Incentive Amount (the sum of all such
payments, the "LTIP Cash Incentive Payment");

  

  

(iv) in the event the Company declares, sets aside or pays any dividends or
other distributions directly or indirectly on shares of Company Common Stock,
including, without limitation, any dividends or other distributions declared,
set aside or paid by or through the DISC with respect to shares of DISC Common
Stock, in each case, that are paid on or following the date of this Agreement
and declared at or prior to the Effective Time, then solely for purposes of
this Section 2.05, the amount of the Per Share Phantom Merger Consideration
shall be deemed to increase by the Phantom Dividend Amount; and

  

  

(v) make such other changes to the Company Incentive Plans as the Company and
Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Transactions.

of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other
equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights).

  

  

(d) No obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to make a payment to
a holder of a PHASAR, PSU Award or LTIP Cash Incentive Award (or former holder
of a PHASAR, PSU Award or LTIP Cash Incentive Award) in respect of any such
PHASAR, PSU Award or LTIP Cash Incentive Award held by such holder pursuant to
this Section 2.05 shall be contingent or conditioned upon the delivery by such
holder of any other document or instrument to Parent, the Exchange Agent or

Intellectual Property of such person, or (ii) challenging the ownership,

Subsidiaries of any Company Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no ongoing infringement, misappropriation or other violation
of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

interest of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in or to any material
Company Intellectual Property.

authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and

ability of Parent or Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or on
the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Transactions (any such material
adverse effect, a "Parent Material Adverse Effect"). Parent and each of its
subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of its properties make such

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 4.02. Sub and Parent. (a) Since the date of its incorporation, Sub has
not carried on any business or conducted any operations other than the

holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 4.04. No Conflicts; Consents. (a) The execution and delivery by each
of Parent and Sub of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (as applicable),
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and

result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries under, any
provision of (i) the charter or organizational documents of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries, (ii) any material Contract to which Parent or any of its

Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions

therein have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid,
binding and enforceable obligations of Parent, except as such enforcement may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
or by principles of equity. The fee letter does not contain any terms that
could adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, timing,
availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing.

supplements thereto, the "Form S-4"). Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts (i) to have the Form S-4 become effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and (ii) to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Transactions. The Company
will cause the proxy statement contained in the Form S-4 to be disseminated to
the holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 has become effective under the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the
other and/or its counsel an opportunity to review and comment on such document
(including the proposed final version of such document), (ii) shall consider
in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other or its counsel and
(iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent will provide for inclusion or incorporation by
reference into the Form S-4 all reasonably required information relating to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, and the Form
S-4 shall include all information reasonably requested by such other party to
be included therein. Parent shall promptly notify the Company and its counsel
of any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Form S-4, and shall provide the Company with copies of written
correspondence between Parent and its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any such comments from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4, and will use its reasonable
efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments of the Company or its counsel
prior to such response. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent in responding to any such comments from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Form S-4. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which Parent is
not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Securities Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The information provided by Parent and the Company specifically for use in
the Form S-4 shall not, with respect to the information provided by such
person, on the date upon which the proxy statement and prospectus contained in
the Form S-4 is distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly (i) correct any
information provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Form S-4 to include any information that shall
become necessary in order to make the statements in the Form S-4, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent further
agrees to cause the Form S-4 as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be
filed with the SEC and each of the Company and Parent agrees to cause the Form
S-4 to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock (and will use
its reasonable efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments of the other
party and/or its counsel prior to such filing and dissemination), in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.

  

  

SECTION 6.02. Company Shareholder Approval and Related Matters. (a) The Form
S-4, including the proxy statement therein, will contain the Company
Recommendation, and (ii) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the Company shall duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of seeking the
Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval as soon as practicable
after the effectiveness of the Form S-4. The Company shall take all other
commercially reasonable actions, subject to the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board, to ensure that the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained in
accordance with all applicable Laws and the Company Charter, Company Bylaws
and the Shareholders Agreement, as applicable. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of its receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

(b) Promptly after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
shall provide notice of such approval to those holders of Company Common Stock
who have objected to the Merger and such other persons as required under
applicable Law (the "Authorization Notice"). Such notice shall comply with
Section 623 of the NYBCL and other applicable Law. Parent shall furnish to the
Company such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion
in the Authorization Notice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The information provided and to be provided by each of Parent and the
Company specifically for use in the Authorization Notice shall not, with
respect to the information supplied by such person, on the date upon which the
Authorization Notice is distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to promptly (i) correct
any information provided by it specifically for use in the Authorization
Notice to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Authorization Notice to include any
information necessary in order to make the statements in the Authorization
Notice, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to cause the Authorization
Notice as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock (and will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments of the other party and/or its
counsel prior to such filing and dissemination), in each case to the extent
required by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 6.03. Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and to Parent's officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; provided, however, that the Company may withhold, and may cause the
Company Subsidiaries to withhold (a) such portions of documents or information
relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange
of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by the
Company's counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for the
Company or its affiliates or (b) any document or information, if access or
disclosure thereto, as determined by the Company's counsel, might reasonably
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product protection
of the Company or any of its affiliates. If any material is withheld by the
Company pursuant to the proviso in the preceding sentence, the Company shall
inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All
information provided by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement dated March 20, 2015 between the
Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

SECTION 6.04. Best Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Sub and the
Company shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 6.04 shall not
be construed to require Parent or any its subsidiaries to offer, take, commit
to or accept any action, efforts, restrictions or limitations of or on Parent
or any of its subsidiaries if such Actions, individually or in the aggregate,
would or would reasonably be expected to result (after giving effect to any
reasonably expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets) in a
Combined Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the breach or failure to be true and
correct of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.05. Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, neither Parent nor
the Company shall, without the approval of the other (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make or cause to be made
any press release or other public announcement regarding the Transactions;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit any party from
making, issuing or releasing any announcements, statements, or acknowledgments
that such party is required to make, issue or release by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or listing rules of a securities exchange or
trading market or inter-dealer quotation system (provided that such party has
used reasonable efforts to give the other party prior notice thereof and an
opportunity to review such disclosure). Parent and the Company will consult
with each other concerning the means by which the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be informed of the Merger.
The Company acknowledges, and has been so advised, that Parent will be
required to file this Agreement with the SEC as a "material contract".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.06. Benefits. (a) For a period of two years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide or cause its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to provide at least (i) a base salary, base wages and annual cash
bonus opportunity (but excluding any defined benefit pension, nonqualified
retirement, equity, phantom equity and long-term incentive compensation
benefits) to each employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") that
are at least equal to the base salaries, base wages and annual cash bonus
opportunities in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are at least equal to
those severance benefits set forth on Section 6.06(a)(i) or 6.06(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as applicable, and (iii) employee benefit plans and
arrangements (other than base salary, base wages, annual bonus opportunities,
long-term incentive compensation, equity, phantom equity and severance
benefits) to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that nothing in this clause (iii) shall be construed to
prevent Parent from modifying any such employee benefit plans or arrangements
to the extent that changes to such plans or arrangements were being
contemplated by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, including,
but not limited to, the elimination of the PPO medical coverage option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of two years following the
Effective Time, Parent shall grant to 12 executives of the Company who are
Continuing Employees, such individuals to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing Date (the "Award Executives"), equity,
equity-based or phantom equity awards under Parent's Stock Incentive Plan that
are substantially comparable in value to the aggregate equity, phantom equity
and long-term incentive compensation grants that each such executive received
under the Company Incentive Plans in the Company's fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, excluding any one-time retention incentives, solely in accordance
with the terms and conditions of Parent's Stock Incentive Plan, as it may be
amended from time to time, other than any such amendment that would have the
effect of excluding from participation in Parent's Stock Incentive Plan any of
the Award Executives.

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, honor all obligations
under the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement, for purposes of any Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of
control", or other similar term, the Transactions shall be deemed to
constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" or satisfy the
requirements of such other similar term.

  

  

(c) For purposes of the applicable Executive Severance Plan, Section 6.06(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter lists those individuals agreed by Parent and
the Company to be entitled to voluntarily terminate employment with Parent and
its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) for "good reason" (as
defined in the applicable Executive Severance Plan) at any time beginning six
months following the Effective Time to the date that is two years following
the Effective Time in accordance with the applicable Executive Severance Plan;
provided that the inclusion or absence of any individual on Section 6.06(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter as of the date of this Agreement shall not be
construed to establish or indicate that such individual shall not be entitled
to terminate employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) for "good reason" (as defined in the applicable
Executive Severance Plan) at any time within two years following the Effective
Time, provided that such individual does in fact have "good reason" (as
defined in the applicable Executive Severance Plan) to terminate employment.
In the event Parent or one of its affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) amends, modifies or terminates an applicable Executive Severance
Plan covering any of the individuals set forth on Section 6.06(a)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter without such individual's written consent and
without adopting a replacement plan or agreement applicable to such individual
that is not less favorable than the applicable Executive Severance Plan (as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) would have been to such individual and
maintaining such replacement plan or agreement for the duration of such
individual's employment, provided such individual remains employed by Parent
or any of its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) upon the
effective date of such amendment, modification or termination, then such
individual shall be relieved of, and Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall waive and refrain from enforcing, any non-compete
restrictions to which such individual may be subject as of the Effective Time
as part of any restrictive covenants agreement or similar agreement or
undertaking in favor of the Company or any of its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (excluding equity, phantom equity,
long-term incentive, early retirement subsidies and benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plans and schemes), each Continuing Employee's service
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the extent
service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent and its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation); provided, however, that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be
waived, any preexisting condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such preexisting condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

(f) With respect to the Company's fiscal year ended December 31 of the year in
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each Continuing Employee a cash bonus payment that is
not less than such Continuing Employee's cash target bonus amount for such
fiscal year ended December 31, payable in the normal course, subject to such
Continuing Employee's continued employment through the end of the Company's
fiscal year ended December 31 in which the Effective Time occurs; provided,
however, that if such Continuing Employee's employment is terminated by Parent
or any of its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) other than
for cause, death or disability or, if such Continuing Employee terminates
employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) for "good reason", as defined in the applicable Executive
Severance Plan, in accordance with such Executive Severance Plan rights, in
either case, on or prior to the end of such fiscal year ended December 31,
such Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive such bonus payment.

  

  

(g) With respect to any Continuing Employees based outside of the United
States, Parent's obligations under this Section 6.06 shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing Employees are based.

  

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or any other provision of this
Agreement shall (i) except as described in Section 2.05, be construed to
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement, or any right of any Person to employment or continued
employment for any specified period or to a particular term or condition of
employment, (ii) except as described in Section 6.06(c), require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain or continue any
specific benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(iii) be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (iv) except as described in
Section 6.06, limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) each of the Award Executives shall be a deemed third-
party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, Section 6.06(a) as
it only pertains to each such Award Executive, and (ii) each of the
individuals named on Section 6.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed a third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce,
Section 6.06(c) as it only pertains to each such individual.

  

  

SECTION 6.07. Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and the Company shall cooperate
with Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.08. Indemnification. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation
to honor all the Company's obligations to indemnify (including all obligations
to advance funds for expenses) the current or former directors, officers and
employees of the Company against all losses, claims, Taxes, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses")
arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of actions or omissions by
such directors, officers and employees occurring prior to the Effective Time
to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of this
Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and such individual
indemnity agreements as of the date hereof from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims
against such directors, officers and employees arising out of such acts or
omissions.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to prior to the Effective Time Parent shall, cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium
(with such payment of premium to be deemed an Other Adjustment if paid by the
Surviving Corporation) for a "tail" policy extension of the directors' and
officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director, officer or employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from the Effective Time the DandO Insurance, the cost of which shall be
deemed an Other Adjustment, with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 6.09. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

  

SECTION 6.10. Shareholder Representative. (a) By virtue of (x) the execution
and delivery of the Letter of Transmittal, in the case of holders of Company
Common Stock, and (y) accepting the Per Share Phantom Merger Consideration, in
case of holders of PHASARs or PSU Awards, each holder of Company Common Stock
and each holder of PHASARs or PSU Awards irrevocably constitutes and appoints
the Shareholder Representative to act on its behalf for all purposes under

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have the authority, for and on behalf
of holders of Company Common Stock (except for the holders, if any, of
Dissenting Shares) and the holders of PHASARs or PSU Awards, to take such
actions and exercise such discretion as are required of the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, and any such actions shall be binding on each such holder and shall

and any other documents relating thereto on behalf of such holder; (ii) to

Escrow Agreement and (x) to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate
in the sole discretion of the Shareholder Representative to accomplish any of

authority to bind each such holder in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent and Sub may rely on such
appointment and authority. The Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement of any and all fees, expenses and costs incurred in the
performance of such Shareholder Representative's duties hereunder. In
furtherance and without limiting the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative
shall be entitled to reimbursement for such fees, expenses and costs through
offset against any funds to be released to such holders from the Escrow Fund
as provided in the Escrow Agreement or from any amounts paid to the
Shareholder Representative for distribution to such holders pursuant to this

or expenses incurred or suffered by the Representative Indemnitee as a result
of, or arising out of, or relating to any and all actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement or in connection with the incurrence, payment, discharge or
settlement of any of the obligations of such holders, except for any such
losses, liabilities, claims or expenses that arise on account of the
Shareholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final adjudication. None
of the Representative Indemnitees shall be liable to any person who
immediately prior to the Effective Time held shares of Company Common Stock,
PHASARs or PSU Awards in respect of such arrangements or actions or omissions
in connection therewith, except to the extent that such acts or omissions
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative
under or relating to this Agreement shall constitute a decision for all
persons who immediately prior to the Effective Time held shares of Company
Common Stock, PHASARs or PSU Awards, and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such person, and Parent and Sub may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of such Shareholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such person. Parent
and Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative.

  

  

(e) Prior to the date of the shareholder meeting of the Company referenced in
Section 3.04(b)(i), the Company shall designate a person to serve as the
initial Shareholder Representative, and the Company shall deliver to Parent
notice of such designation. Promptly following such designation, the
Shareholder Representative shall become a party to this Agreement by executing
and delivering a joinder to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company. If the Shareholder Representative
becomes unable to serve as Shareholder Representative, such other person or
persons may be designated by the holders of a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
person or persons shall succeed as the Shareholder Representative.

  

  

(f) The Letter of Transmittal shall require each holder of Company Common
Stock to agree to this Section 6.10 as a condition to receipt of Per Share
Merger Consideration.

use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to, and to
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments
and documents as may be necessary to, consummate and obtain the Financing,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements (the
"Definitive Agreements") with respect to the Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (including any "flex"
provisions), (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), and to cause its
affiliates to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), on a timely basis, all
conditions to obtaining the Financing applicable to Parent or its affiliates
set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are
within its control, (iv) to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Commitment Letter (or obtain the waiver of such
obligations), (v) to consummate the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including the "market flex" provisions) at or prior to the Closing,
including by using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders to fund
the Financing (including by taking enforcement action seeking to cause such
lenders to fund the Financing), and (vi) to otherwise enforce its rights under
the Commitment Letter.

(b) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, replacement, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement (including any fee letter), in
each case, without the Company's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements, including any fee letter,
that (i) does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in
the Commitment Letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) does
not contain additional conditions or other contingencies to funding the
Financing relative to those contained in the Commitment Letter in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, (iii) does not modify in a manner adverse to
Parent the conditions to the funding, enforceability, availability or
termination of the Financing contained in the Commitment Letter in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and (iv) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing or the Transactions; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may amend, replace, supplement and modify the Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as contemplated by the Commitment Letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing or the Transactions; provided, further, that Parent shall notify the
Company in writing of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification of, or waiver of any of its or any of its affiliates' rights
under, the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement reasonably promptly
after the time such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is agreed.
Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the
Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 6.11(b), the term
"Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section 6.11(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter
or this Agreement for any reason, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event but no later than the final day of the Marketing Period, alternative
financing from alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions that are
no less favorable in any material respect to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) and which would not contain any provisions
which would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Financing or the Transactions; provided that
such Alternative Financing shall not contain additional conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Financing relative to those contained in
the Commitment Letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement or contain
conditions to the funding, or provisions related to enforceability,
availability or termination of the Financing that are modified in a manner
adverse to Parent relative to the conditions, or provisions related to
enforceability, availability or termination contained in the Commitment Letter
in effect as of the date of this Agreement. In the event that Alternative
Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this Section 6.11(c), Parent shall
comply with its covenants in this Section 6.11(c) with respect to such
Alternative Financing, and Parent shall deliver to the Company complete and
correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other modifications or
agreements pursuant to which any Alternative Financing shall be made available
to Parent; provided that the existence and amount of fees, "market flex"
provisions, pricing terms and pricing caps set forth in any fee letter, none
of which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability or termination of the Financing, or reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Financing, may be redacted in a customary
manner. In the event that Parent obtains Alternative Financing in accordance
with this Section 6.11(c), the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean the
commitment letter or letters (as amended, replaced, supplemented or modified
in accordance with this Section 6.11(c)) related to the Alternative Financing.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period
of 20 consecutive Business Days throughout and at the end of which the Form
S-4 shall be continuously effective under the Securities Act; provided that
the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, at any time
prior to the completion of such 20 consecutive Business Day period, (i) the
Company's independent accountants shall have withdrawn, or advised the Company
in writing that it intends to withdraw, its audit opinion with respect to the
applicable Required Information, in which case the Marketing Period shall not
be deemed to commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is
issued with respect to the applicable Required Information by the Company's
independent accountants or another independent public accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent, (ii) the financial statements included in the
Required Information that are available to Parent on the first day of any such
20 consecutive Business Day period would be required to be updated under Rule
3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to be sufficiently current on any day during
such 20 consecutive Business Day period to permit a registration statement of
the Company using such financial statements to be declared effective by the
SEC on the last day of such 20 consecutive Business Day period, in which case
the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until the
receipt by the Company of updated Required Information that would be required
under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement of the
Company using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on
the last day of such new 20 consecutive Business Day period, (iii) the
Required Information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state any material fact, in each case with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, necessary in order to make the statements contained in
the Required Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading or (iv) the Company or the Company's independent
accountants determine to restate its or any Company Subsidiary's historical
financial statements, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to commence unless and until such re-statement has been completed and the
relevant financial statements have been amended or the Company or the
Company's independent accountants, as applicable, have indicated that it has
concluded that no restatement shall be required in accordance with GAAP;
provided further, that the Marketing Period shall not begin prior to July 6,
2015 and if such Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August 14,
2015, then it will not commence until September 8, 2015; provided, however,
that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on
which proceeds of the Financing in an amount equal to 100% of the proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letter in effect as of the date hereof is
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the
Company from seeking to replace all or a portion of the Financing or such
Alternative Financing with proceeds from a public offering of equity or debt
securities consummated during the Marketing Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice upon becoming aware of
any material breach of the Commitment Letter by any party to the Commitment
Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing (or Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.11) and any material
developments relating to the Financing and shall provide to the Company, upon
its request, copies of the Definitive Agreements in respect of the Financing.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to
Parent, and shall cause the officers, employees and representatives of the
Company to provide to Parent, at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary or reasonably required in
connection with any debt financing by Parent, Sub or any of their respective
affiliates in connection with the Transactions and that is customary in
connection with financing comparable to the Financing, including the
following: (i) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's senior
officers and other representatives, upon reasonable advance notice, to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda (including the
delivery of customary representation letters as contemplated by the Commitment
Letter) and similar documents reasonably required in connection with the
Financing; (iii) using reasonable best efforts to provide direct contact
between (x) senior management and advisors, including auditors, of the Company
and (y) the proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents, as applicable, and/or Parent's or any of its affiliate's auditors in
connection with the financing; (iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist
with the preparation of any pledge and security documents, any indenture, loan
agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, other definitive financing
documents on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or other certificates,
legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, provided
that none of the Company or any of its officers, employees or representatives
shall be required to execute any documents that would be effective before the
Closing and no obligation of the Company or any of its officers, employees or
representatives under any such document or agreement shall be effective until
the Closing; (v) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging of
collateral, provided that no pledge shall be effective until the Closing; (vi)
using reasonable best efforts to furnish on a confidential basis to Parent and
its financing sources, as promptly as practicable, financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by

by the documents used in connection with the Financing and such additional
financial information as is necessary to make such financial statements
compliant with Regulation S-X (the "Required Information"); (vii) providing
monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company
customarily prepares such financial statements within the time such statements
are customarily prepared; (viii) deliver to Parent, at least five days prior
to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information relating to the
Company and its affiliates required by regulatory authorities under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act, to the extent such documentation and other
information is requested by providers of the Financing at least 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date; and (ix) using reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company's independent accountants to cooperate with and assist
Parent in preparing customary and appropriate information packages and
offering materials as the parties to the Commitment Letter or other parties
participating in the Financing may reasonably request for use in connection
with the offering and/or syndication of equity securities, debt securities,
loan participations and other matters contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
including by providing customary accountant's comfort letters (including
"negative assurance") and consents from the Company's independent accountants;
provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would, in the Company's reasonable judgment, (A) interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company, (B) cause any
representation, warranty, covenant or other term in this Agreement to be
breached or (C) cause any closing condition set forth in this Agreement to
fail to be satisfied; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, until the Closing occurs, neither the Shareholder
Representative nor the Company nor any of their respective affiliates shall
(1) be required to pay any commitment or other fee, (2) have any liability or
obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or any other
agreement or document related to the Financing (or Alternative Financing) or
(3) be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or any Alternative Financing) or take
any action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default
of, or breach under, or otherwise violate any Material Contract. Parent shall,
promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) to the extent such costs and expenses are incurred by the
Company or any of its affiliates in connection with such cooperation provided
by the Company or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees and
other representatives pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.11 or in
connection with compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.11 and
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates and
their respective officers, employees and representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from
information provided by the Shareholder Representative or the Company), except
in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from the
willful misconduct of the Company or any of its representatives. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the Financing;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company and its affiliates and their respective marks.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective
obligations to consummate the Transactions on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or
consummation of the Financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

  

  

SECTION 6.12. Section 280G Vote. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from each person who is, with
respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) a waiver of any payments or benefits that might otherwise
reasonably result in the payment or provision of "parachute payments" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), such that after giving effect to
all waivers, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made or
provided, or is required to make or provide, any such payments or benefits
(the payments and benefits waived (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
be, with respect to any individual, the amounts in excess of 299% of such
individual's "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code))
shall be collectively referred to as the "Section 280G Waived Payments").

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 6.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit, accompanied by adequate
disclosure, for shareholder approval all Section 280G Waived Payments in
accordance with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder with the purpose of determining the right of
each "disqualified individual" to receive the Section 280G Waived Payments by
rendering the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code
inapplicable to any and all payments and benefits provided by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to those individuals who have executed a waiver
pursuant to Section 6.12(a) that, in the absence of such waiver, might
otherwise reasonably result in the provision of any payments or benefits that
would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

(c) The Company shall provide to Parent, no later than 10 days prior to
obtaining the waivers, (i) drafts of any waivers, disclosure documents and
other relevant documents relating to the waiver and vote prepared by the
Company in connection with this Section 6.12 and (ii) reasonable documentation
regarding the determination of the Section 280G Waived Payments. The Company
shall incorporate any reasonable comments timely made by Parent prior to
obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote.

SECTION 6.13. Exclusivity. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other
than Parent and its affiliates and their respective agents and
representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Transaction. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, representatives or agents will, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing or disclosing non-public information) any inquiries or the making
of any proposal with respect to any Acquisition Transaction or negotiate or
otherwise facilitate, encourage, solicit, initiate or engage in discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers with any person with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction, enter into any written agreement,
arrangement, or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail to
consummate the Transactions or otherwise cooperate in any way with or assist
or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
person to do or seek any of the foregoing. As used herein, "Acquisition
Transaction" means any merger, consolidation, or other business combination
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the acquisition of all or
any amount of the assets or the capital stock of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than as permitted or contemplated by this Agreement.

shall be true and correct on and as of such date), other than for such
failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. For the purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition in
the immediately preceding sentence, the representations and warranties of
Parent and Sub shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to

material respects, the financial condition of the Company) or to whether or
not any breach results or may result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as required by Section 6.04.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

(d) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a), 7.02(b) or 7.02(c), and

written notice to the Company of such breach (provided that Parent is not then

(f) by the Company, if (i) Parent shall have failed to consummate the Merger
by the time set forth in Section 1.02, (ii) all the conditions set forth in

intentional breach by a party of any representation, warranty or covenant set
forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 8.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; provided,
however, that (i) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such shareholders,
(ii) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time,
(iii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement by the Company
shall require the approval of the shareholders of the Company and (iv) any

materially adversely affects the rights of the Financing Sources shall not be
effective without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. This

extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized
designee of its Board of Directors. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of the
Company.

  

  

ARTICLE IX 
 

  

  

Indemnification

  

  

SECTION 9.01. Parent's Indemnification. From and after the Closing, Parent,
Sub, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives
("Parent Indemnitee") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Escrow
Fund from and against any and all Losses directly arising out of or based
upon:

  

  

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment prior to the Closing of any covenant,
agreement or other obligation of the Company set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

(c) consideration paid to holders of Dissenting Shares exceeding the Per Share
Merger Consideration attributable to such shares, provided that the Losses
attributable thereto shall be limited to the amount that such consideration
exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration attributable to such shares; and

  

  

(d) all Indemnified Taxes.

  

  

Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses associated with any
claim for indemnification under this Section 9.01(a) (and not, for the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining any misrepresentation in or
breach of any representation or warranty), the representations and warranties
set forth therein shall be deemed to be made as though there were no
"material", "in all material respects", Company Material Adverse Effect or
other materiality qualifier.

  

  

SECTION 9.02. Shareholder Indemnification. From and after the Closing, the
Shareholder Representative, the holders of any shares of the Company Common
Stock and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents and representatives (the "Shareholder Indemnitees") shall
be indemnified and held harmless by Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation
from and against, and Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall
reimburse the Shareholder Indemnitees for, any and all Losses directly arising
out of or based upon:

  

  

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement; and

  

  

(c) any breach or nonfulfillment after the Closing of any covenant, agreement
or other obligation of Company set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.03. Defense of Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which any party to this
Agreement may have an obligation to indemnify another party to this Agreement,
the party that is asserting such right to indemnity (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give the party from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party")
written notice thereof within 10 Business Days after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, but any failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five Business Days' time
after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim, but any failure to make such deliveries to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, shall have the right, within 10 Business Days of
receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third
Party Claim upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party at its sole
cost and expense; provided that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (i)
the claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to them which are different from or in addition
to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable opinion
of the Indemnified Parties, counsel for the Indemnifying Party could not
adequately represent the interest of the Indemnified Parties because such
interests could be in conflict with those of the Indemnified Parties; or (iii)
such claim or Action involves criminal liability. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense but the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
participation or otherwise in connection with the defense of such claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such legal
expenses if the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that the incurrence
of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available to the
Indemnifying Party, conflicts of interest or other similar circumstances.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) consent to the settlement, compromise or discharge of
a Third Party Claim (i) which provides for any relief other than the payment
of monetary damages or (ii) which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by all third party claimants to the Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect thereof.

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
claim as provided in this Section 9.03, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (other than
during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give
notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above), and the Indemnifying Party
will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this
Section 9.03. The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required by this
Section 9.03 shall be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigations or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses
incurred.

  

  

SECTION 9.04. Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party in writing with reasonable promptness, setting forth
specifically the obligation with respect to which the claim is made, the facts
giving rise to and the alleged basis for such claim and, if known or
reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the liability asserted or which may be
asserted by reason thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event the Indemnifying Party disputes
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article IX, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after receipt of notice under this
Section 9.04 to give written notice of such objection, and the grounds
therefor, and the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have 20 days to respond
in writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such 20-day
period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall attempt
in good faith for 20 days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to such indemnification obligation.

  

  

SECTION 9.05. Survival. (a) The representations and warranties of each party
contained in this Agreement, other than the Tax Reps, and the covenants
contained in this Agreement to the extent required to be performed prior to
Closing shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the date that is 12
months after the Closing Date (the "Survival Expiration Date"), at which time
such representations and warranties and covenants shall terminate and
thereafter be of no force and effect. The Tax Reps shall not survive the
Closing. Any claim for indemnity under Section 9.01 or Section 9.02 must be
asserted in writing prior to the Survival Expiration Date, except for any
claim for indemnity arising under Section 6.06, which must be asserted in
writing prior to the date that is two years and three months after the Closing
Date and any claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.02 related to Section
11.05. The other covenants contained in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement shall survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), a party's rights to indemnification under
this Article IX, and the other provisions of this Article IX, shall not
terminate with respect to any claim with respect to which the Indemnified
Party has delivered a written notice to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
Survival Expiration Date, alleging in good faith a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant or other right to indemnification and
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for indemnification, the facts
upon which the claim for indemnification is based and an estimate in
reasonable detail of the Losses incurred in connection therewith; provided,
however, that the applicable representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
right to indemnification under this Article IX shall survive only until, and
only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice.

  

  

SECTION 9.06. Indemnification Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

  

  

(a) Any Parent Indemnitee or Shareholder Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
indemnification for Losses under Sections 9.01(a) (other than with respect to
misrepresentations of any Fundamental Rep and fraudulent misrepresentations),
9.01(b) (to the extent arising out of a breach of Section 5.01) or 9.02(a)
(other than with respect to misrepresentations of any Fundamental Rep and
fraudulent misrepresentations) unless (i) such Losses from any single claim or
aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances is an
amount in excess of $250,000, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Losses for
such claims by such Parent Indemnitee or Shareholder Indemnitee, as
applicable, under this Agreement exceeds $20,000,000 (the "Deductible"), and
then Parent Indemnitee or Shareholder Indemnitee, as applicable, may only
recover for the aggregate Losses amount of all Losses in excess of the
Deductible. In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Company for all
Losses under this Article IX exceed the Escrow Amount minus the amount, if
any, paid to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.02(d)(ii).
Any and all payments of any indemnification obligations to any Parent
Indemnitee under this Article IX shall be made solely and exclusively from the
funds, if any, then constituting the Escrow Fund. Any Parent Indemnitee's sole
recourse for indemnity in respect of any Loss under this Article IX shall be
limited solely and exclusively to the funds, if any, then constituting the
Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall the aggregate liability of Parent for all Losses arising under
Section 9.01(a) with respect to Sections 4.07, 4.08 and 4.09 exceed
$75,000,000.

  

  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall mitigate all Losses in accordance with
applicable Law for which such Indemnified Parties are entitled or may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX. The amount of any Losses
for which indemnification is provided for under this Article IX shall be (i)
offset by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Parties as a
result of any indemnification by any third party and any insurance proceeds or
other amounts received by the Indemnified Parties from third parties with
respect to such Losses (net of the cost of recovery) and (ii) reduced to take
account of any tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss in the Tax year in which the
Loss was incurred (or in the succeeding Tax year), in each case on a "with and
without" basis. If any such insurance proceeds and/or other amounts are
actually received and/or authorized for deferred accounting by any Parent
Indemnitee after receipt of any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article IX, Parent shall promptly repay to the Company such portion of such
indemnification payment equal to the amounts so recovered or realized.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.02, 9.01 or 9.02 shall be treated
as an adjustment to the purchase price for all tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form
870-AD or successor form).

  

  

(d) The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a liability in
calculating Net Working Capital shall be calculated net of the amount so
included. The amount of the Loss arising out of any reduction in value of any
Current Asset acquired at the Closing shall be calculated net of the reported
value of such Current Asset used in calculating Net Working Capital.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX
for any Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected in the Final
Indebtedness or in the Final Net Working Capital.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Parent Indemnitee nor Shareholder Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX with respect to any losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses that are in the nature of punitive, speculative, special
or treble or other multiple damages required by statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation or code, in each case of any kind or nature, regardless of the form
of action through which any of the foregoing are sought (except to the extent
such damages are payable to third parties).

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX with
respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of the Company made as of the Closing Date as a result of a
matter arising between the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing, if: (i) the Company provides written notice to Parent prior to
Closing, describing in detail such breach or inaccuracy, (ii) Company
simultaneously and irrevocably informs Parent in writing that Parent is not
required to consummate the Transactions and (iii) the Closing occurs.

  

  

(g) The representations and warranties of the Company shall not be affected or
deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of Parent or
Sub (including any of the representatives of Parent or Sub) or by reason of
the fact that Parent or Sub or any of the representatives of Parent or Sub
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is or might
be inaccurate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.07. Release of Escrow Fund. (a) As promptly as practicable and in
any event no later than the third Business Day following the Survival
Expiration Date, Parent shall provide to the Shareholder Representative (i) a
written notice of its reasonable and good faith determination of the Projected
Indemnity Amount, together with reasonable supporting calculations and
documentation, and (ii) a written notice duly executed by Parent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund equal to
the amount by which the amount of the Escrow Fund as of the Survival
Expiration Date exceeds the Projected Indemnity Amount so determined by Parent
(such notice, the "Expiration Date Release Notice"). The Shareholder
Representative shall promptly execute the Expiration Date Release Notice
following receipt and delivery of the same to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the
Escrow Agent will release the relevant funds from the Escrow Fund. Promptly
following resolution of all claims for indemnification from the Escrow Fund
that were pending as of the Survival Expiration Date, the Shareholder
Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
all cash then constituting the Escrow Fund. The term "Projected Indemnity
Amount" means the maximum aggregate amount of Losses that, as of the Survival
Expiration Date, would reasonably be expected to be indemnified by the Escrow
Fund pursuant to this Article IX in respect of claims that have been timely
asserted but not finally resolved by such date; provided, however, that in the
case of any claim under Section 9.01(d), such claim is limited to an amount of
Indemnified Tax that is (i) shown as due on a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) with respect to an item for which a Governmental Entity has
identified in writing an issue and has provided, in writing, sufficient
information to determine the nature and, taking into account the relevant Tax
Return and accompanying work papers, amount of the issue, or (iii) with
respect to a Tax position for which a reserve has been established for
financial reporting purposes. Anything to the contrary in the foregoing
notwithstanding, the execution and delivery of an Expiration Date Release
Notice by the Shareholder Representative shall not prevent or otherwise impair
the Shareholder Representative from disputing the Projected Indemnity Amount
or any liability in respect of claims included in the determination of the
Projected Indemnity Amount.

  

  

(b) If all or any portion of the Escrow Fund is released as provided in
Section 9.07(a), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall, with respect
to any such release, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to use the remaining
portion to make payments in the manner contemplated by clauses (A) and (B) of
Section 2.02(d)(i).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.08. Exclusive Remedy. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided
in Sections 2.02 and 10.09 and claims for fraud, each party to this Agreement
acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect
to any and all claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the
Transactions, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
assets and liabilities shall, in each case, be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing,
except as otherwise specifically provided in Sections 2.02 and 10.09 and
claims for fraud, each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any document
or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law, common
law or otherwise except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.08(a) shall limit any third-
party beneficiary rights conferred to any individual under Section 2.05, 6.06
or 6.08.

  

  

(b) After the Closing, no party may bring any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to rescind the Transactions or this Agreement, whether based on fraud,
gross negligence, negligence, breach of contract, breach of statute or
otherwise.

prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its
sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations

an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Subject to the immediately following sentence, the parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,

Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 10.10 without proof of damages or otherwise, this

Agreement and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 10.09 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security

injunction or injunctions hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount
or absence of any such bond or other security requested or offered by the
party seeking such injunction or injunctions. If, prior to the Outside Date,
any party brings any suit, action or proceeding, in each case in accordance
with Section 10.10, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such suit,
action or proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such suit, action or
proceeding, as the case may be.

not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New

return receipt requested, to the address for notices set out in Section 10.01
shall be sufficient to satisfy all legal requirements for service of process.

proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by

Taxes

  

  

SECTION 11.01. Tax Returns. (a) The Company shall (A) prepare and timely file,
(or cause the applicable Company Subsidiary to prepare and timely file) all
Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary due (after taking into
account all appropriate extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date ("Company
Prepared Returns") and (B) timely pay (or cause the applicable Company
Subsidiary to timely pay) all Taxes that are shown as payable with respect to
Company Prepared Returns. All Company Prepared Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures, practices, and accounting methods of the
Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary and, to the extent applicable,
the conventions provided for in accordance with Section 11.01(c). Parent shall
not amend or cause the Company to amend any Company Prepared Return or other
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period unless (i) such amendment is required
to claim a Seller Refund under Section 11.05, (ii) the Shareholder
Representative consents in writing to such amendment, (iii) Parent waives any
rights to indemnification under Section 9.01(d) in respect of any matters
related to such amendment or (iv) such amendment as is required by Law.

  

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary due
after the Closing Date (the "Parent Prepared Returns"). All Parent Prepared
Returns relating to a taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing
Date, and all amendments of Company Prepared Returns required to claim
carrybacks of tax attributes shown on such Parent Prepared Returns, shall be
filed within seven months following the Closing Date. To the extent that a
Parent Prepared Return relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax
Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and
practices and accounting methods, and, to the extent applicable, the
conventions provided in Section 11.01(c), unless, as reasonably determined by
Parent, otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Parent Prepared Return that
shows an Indemnified Tax shall be submitted to the Shareholder Representative
for its review and comment at least 30 days prior to the date the Tax Return
is required to be filed under this Section 11.01(b). Parent shall incorporate
any reasonable comments made by the Shareholder Representative in the final
Tax Return prior to filing. No failure or delay of Parent in providing Parent
Prepared Returns for the Shareholder Representative to review shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent the
Shareholder Representative was actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Shareholder Representative and Parent agree with respect to certain
Tax matters as follows:

  

  

(i) To the extent permissible (or required) under applicable Laws, elect to
have each Tax year of the Company and each Company Subsidiary to end as of the
end of the Closing Date;

  

  

(ii) Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Entity
that is final, neither Shareholder Representative nor Parent shall take any
position (and Parent shall not allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
take any position) during the course of any audit or other proceedings with
respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns (whether or not a Tax Contest) that is
inconsistent with any election, position, or other decision that is to be made
in accordance with this Section 11.01(c).

  

  

SECTION 11.02. Apportionment of Taxes. For purposes of determining the amount
of Taxes that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period the parties agree as follows:

  

  

(a) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amounts that are attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying
the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

(b) In the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, employment Taxes,
and sales and use Taxes) the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the
Company or Company Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such
Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on as of the end of the
day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology" (including
for any Flow-Through Entity in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
holds an interest). For purposes of this clause (ii), any item determined on
an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation
deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
mechanics set forth in clause (i) for periodic Taxes.

  

  

(c) All Taxes in the form of interest or penalties that relate to Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) shall be treated as occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such
items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after
the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 11.03. Cooperation. Parent, the Company, and the Shareholder
Representative shall (and shall cause their respective affiliates to) (i)
assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) assist in any audit or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(whether or not a Tax Contest); (iii) make available any information, records,
or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; (iv) provide any information necessary or reasonably
requested to allow Parent, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary to comply
with any information reporting or withholding requirements contained in the
Code or other applicable Laws; (v) provide any information necessary or
reasonably requested to permit Parent, the Company, and the Exchange Agent to
comply with its information reporting and withholding obligations with respect
to any payments made pursuant to this Agreement; and (vi) provide certificates
or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate
to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

  

  

SECTION 11.04. Tax Contests. Parent shall control, or cause the Company or
applicable Company Subsidiary to control, the conduct of any audit, IRS
Compliance Assurance Process proceeding, or other proceeding relating to Taxes
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (a "Tax Contest"); provided, however,
that the Shareholder Representative, at its sole cost and expense, shall have
the right to control any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period). For the avoidance of doubt,
to the extent there is a conflict between this Section 11.04 and any
provisions of Section 9.03, this Section 11.04 shall control.

  

  

SECTION 11.05. Tax Refunds.

  

  

(a) (i) All refunds of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, subject to Section 11.05(c) (other than refunds of
Transfer Taxes, which shall be allocated in the same manner as Transfer Taxes
are allocated under Section 6.07) and (ii) any Tax benefit resulting from the
payment of (x) the Change in Control Payments, (y) any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.05 in respect of PHASARs and PSU Awards, including the
Phantom Equity Payments and (z) the balance as of the Closing Date in respect
of the Company Deferred Compensation Plans (without duplication and in each
case, whether in the form of cash received from the applicable Governmental
Entity or a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable for any Post-
Closing Tax period) shall be for the benefit of the holders of the Company
Common Stock, PHASARs and PSU Awards (each such refund, credit or offset, a
"Seller Refund").

  

  

(b) To the extent that Parent, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary becomes
entitled to a Seller Refund, including as a result of the ability to carry
back any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit (which
carryback shall not be waived), Parent shall take such actions as are
necessary to obtain such Seller Refund, and pay to the Shareholder
Representative for distribution to the holders of the Company Common Stock,
PHASARS and PSU Awards in accordance with their Per Share Phantom Portion the
amount of such Seller Refund (without interest other than interest received
from the Governmental Entity), net of any Taxes and any out-of-pocket expenses
that Parent, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary or any of their affiliates
incur (or has or will incur) with respect to such Seller Refund (and related
interest). The net amount due to the Shareholder Representative shall be
payable 10 days after receipt of the Seller Refund from the applicable
Governmental Entity (or, if the Seller Refund is in the form of credit,
offset, or other reduction of Tax, 10 days after filing the Tax Return
claiming such reduction).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.05(a)(i) shall not require that Parent make any payment with
respect to (i) any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of
any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in Post-
Closing Tax Period; (ii) any refund of Tax resulting from the payments of
Taxes made on or after Closing Date to the extent Parent, Company, or the
applicable Company Subsidiary has not been indemnified for such Taxes; (iii)
any refund for Tax that is reflected as a current asset (or offset to a
current liability) on the Final Net Working Capital; or (iv) any refund for
Tax that gives rise to a payment obligation by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any person under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a
Contract or other agreement entered (or assumed) by the Company (or any
Company Subsidiary) on or prior to the Closing Date.

written above.
