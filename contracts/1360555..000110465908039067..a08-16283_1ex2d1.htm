share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

### 

  

### (c) _Treatment of Company Options._

  

### 

  

#### (i) Prior to the Closing, the Companys Board of Directors (the "
_Company Board_ ") shall have adopted appropriate resolutions and taken all

any holder elects to cancel any Company Option, such holder shall indicate
such election pursuant to a certificate attached to the Notice to Option
Holders (an " _Option Cancellation Certificate_ ") delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time (which will be forwarded by the Company to
Parent), and such Company Option shall be cancelled effective as of

applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Legal
Requirements to be withheld or otherwise paid by the Company, including any
fringe benefit tax) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of
vested Company Options with an exercise price that is less than the Common
Stock Per Share Amount (such shares the " _In-the-Money Option Shares_ ")
previously subject to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Common Stock Per Share Amount (calculated using Estimated Merger
Consideration and not Merger Consideration, and without giving effect to the

providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of

Time.

  

### 

  

## 2.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _No Further Rights as Company Stockholders_. At the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease

" _Certificate_ ") shall have any rights as a shareholder of Company.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to Parent, together with a letter of transmittal in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Company, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (i) the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
as provided in Section 2.6(b) with respect to such Certificate and (ii) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Parent shall,
no later than two Business Days after receipt of each properly
surrendered Certificate, cause the payment described in the preceding
sentence to be made to the holder of such Certificate by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by such holder in the
letter of transmittal delivered with such Certificate. Until so surrendered,
each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to
receive the portion of

  



        
   

  



  

### the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.6(b). If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.7.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Transfers of Ownership_.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer

such record holder and the agreement by such record holder to indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in respect of any losses the Surviving Corporation
incurs with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the Virginia
Act (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and who, as of the Effective Time, has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive any
cash consideration pursuant to this Section 2, but the holder thereof shall
only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the Virginia Act.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Withdrawal or Loss of Right._ Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.9(a), if any holder of shares of Company Stock who demands
appraisal of such shares under the Virginia Act shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then,
as of the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such
event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the amount of cash which its holder
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2 had it not
demanded appraisal rights under the Virginia Act, without interest thereon,
upon surrender to the Company of the certificate representing such shares in
accordance with Section 2.7.

  

### 

  

## 2.10 _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_.  Each share of the common
stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub then outstanding shall be

## 2.11 _Escrow Fund_. Prior to each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Time that is held by a Significant
Shareholder being converted or cancelled in exchange for the right to receive
the amounts set forth in Section 2.6, the Escrow Fund shall be withheld from
the Merger Consideration payable to such Significant Shareholders (in
accordance with their respective Significant Shareholder
Percentage Interests) and deposited with the Escrow Agent. The Indemnity
Portion of the Escrow Fund shall be held for the purpose of securing the
indemnification obligations of the Significant Shareholders set forth in this
Agreement. The Net Working Capital Portion of the Escrow Fund shall be held
for the purpose of securing any amounts owed to Parent as a result of any
decrease to the Merger Consideration after the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 2.13 below being less than the estimated Net Working Capital amount
pursuant to Section 2.13(a) below. The Shareholders Agent Expense Portion of
the Escrow Fund shall be held for the purpose of funding any expenses of the
Shareholders Agent arising in connection with the administration of the
Shareholders Agents duties herein after the Effective Time. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide for (i) the release, subject to a reserve for pending
claims, of the Indemnity Portion of the Escrow Fund remaining in the escrow

for any amounts payable to the Shareholders Agent, for further distribution
to the Significant Shareholders) within five (5) Business Days after the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date; (ii) the release of Net
Working Capital Portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of

## (b) The Merger Consideration paid on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Merger Consideration_ ") shall be based on the Closing Date estimates
described above. The parties acknowledge and agree that the exact amount of
the Merger Consideration will not be known as of the Closing Date and that
the Estimated Merger Consideration paid on the Closing Date is an estimate of
the Merger Consideration which may need to be adjusted subsequent to the
Closing Date on the basis set forth herein. Accordingly, as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall prepare and deliver to the

in writing (such notice, a " _Merger Consideration Dispute Notice_ ") of
any discrepancy in, or disagreement with, the items reflected on the
Merger Consideration Statement (and specifying the amount in dispute and
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such discrepancy or
disagreement), and upon agreement by the Parent regarding the adjustment
requested by the Shareholders Agent, an appropriate adjustment shall be made
thereto. If the Shareholders Agent does not deliver a Merger Consideration
Dispute Notice to the Parent during such thirty (30) day period, or agrees in
writing with the Merger Consideration Statement, the Merger Consideration
Statement shall be deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the
Shareholders Agent. If the Parent and the Shareholders Agent do not agree,
within thirty (30) days after timely delivery of the Merger Consideration
Dispute Notice, to resolve any discrepancy or disagreement therein, the
discrepancy or disagreement shall be submitted for review and final
determination by an accounting firm of national reputation that is
independent of the parties and mutually acceptable to the Shareholders Agent
and Parent (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The review of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to the discrepancies and
disagreements set forth in the Merger Consideration Dispute Notice, and the
resolution of such discrepancies and disagreements and the determination of
the Merger Consideration by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be (i) in
writing, (ii) made in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with
GAAP, in accordance with the Companys past practices, (iii) with respect to
any specific discrepancy or disagreement, no greater than the higher amount
calculated by the Parent or the Shareholders Agent, as the case may be, and
no lower than the lower amount calculated

  



        
   

  



  

### by the Parent or the Shareholders Agent as the case may be, (iv) made as
promptly as practical after the submission of such discrepancies
and disagreements to the Independent Accounting Firm (but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after the date of submission), and (v) final and
binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns for all purposes hereof, and not subject to collateral
attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud.  All expenses and fees
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne one-half (1/2) by the
Parent, on the one hand, and one-half (1/2) by the Significant Shareholders
(from the Shareholders Agent Expense Portion of the Escrow Fund, in
accordance with their Significant Shareholder Percentage Interest), on the
other hand; provided, however, that if the Independent Accounting Firm
determines that the final amount owed by the Parent pursuant to Section
2.13(d) below is greater than 110% of the previously disputed amount that was
proposed by the Parent, the Parent shall bear 100% of the expenses and fees
of the Independent Accounting Firm, and if the Independent Accounting Firm
determines that the final amount owed to the Parent pursuant to Section
2.13(d) below is less than 90% of the previously disputed amount that was
proposed by the Shareholders Agent, the Significant Shareholders (from the
Shareholders Agent Expense Portion of the Escrow Fund, in accordance with
their Significant Shareholder Percentage Interest) shall bear 100% of the
expenses and fees of the Independent Accounting Firm.

  

### 

  

## (d) If the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.13(c) exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration, the Parent shall pay to
the Shareholders Agent, for further distribution to the Former Shareholders,
the amount of such excess in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If the Merger
Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.13(c) is less than
the Estimated Merger Consideration, the Significant Shareholders shall be
obligated to the Parent for the amount of such deficit in proportion to their
respective Significant Shareholders Percentage Interests, and
the Shareholders Agent and the Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
the amount of such excess to the Parent out of the Net Working Capital
Portion of the Escrow Fund (in accordance with their Significant Shareholder
Percentage Interest). The Significant Shareholders shall pay Parent any
remaining amount of such deficit and the Shareholders Agent and the Parent
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such deficit out of the
Indemnity Portion of the Escrow Fund (in accordance with their Significant
Shareholder Percentage Interest).

such Taxes (including, without limitation, charges for or in connection with

Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan as of the date of this Agreement have
been timely paid or accrued. With respect to each Company Employee Plan, no
"reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any
such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived
under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any
event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred. Each
Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared in good faith and timely
filed all requisite governmental reports, which were true and correct in all
material respects as of the date filed, and has properly and timely filed
and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to
be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Employee
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding or action has been brought, or to
the knowledge of Company is threatened in writing or otherwise overtly
threatened in communication with Company, against or with respect to any such
Company Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue
Service or the United States Department of Labor (other than routine claims

plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, as of
the date of this Agreement, any actual or potential withdrawal liability

of payment or vesting of any such benefits or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or service provider.  No benefit payable

"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code) subject to the imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the
Code or the deduction for which would be disallowed by reason of Section
280G of the Code.

addressing material uncapped indemnification obligations owed by Company
pursuant to a provision of the FAR incorporated into such agreement that
otherwise would have been set forth on Section 3.13(b) or Section 3.13(b)(ii)

## 6.4 _Employees; Company 401(k) Plan_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties hereto intend that there shall be continuity of
employment with respect to all employees of Company (the " _Company
Employees_ "). Parent shall continue the employment of each Company Employee
on an "at will" basis on terms and conditions (including but not limited to
base salary, target bonus opportunities, severance benefits, equity
compensation opportunities, duties and office location) that either (i) are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the terms and conditions applicable
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) meet the
requirements of Section 6.4(b).

  

### 

  

(b) Parent may satisfy its obligations under Section 6.4(a) with respect to
Company Employees who continue employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") by providing (to the extent
a comparable Company Employee Plan is not continued after the Effective Time)
that such Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents
plans, programs, policies, practices, contracts, agreements or other
arrangements providing for employment, compensation, retirement,
deferred compensation, loans, severance, separation, termination pay,
performance awards, bonus, incentive, stock option, stock purchase, stock
bonus, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement,
fringe benefits, cafeteria benefits or other benefits, whether written or
unwritten, including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA (" _Parent Employee Plans_ "), to the extent
applicable, on terms that in the aggregate are comparable to those offered to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates; provided, however,
that (1) except as to Parents 401(k) plan and employee stock ownership plan,
Parent shall give each Continuing Employee full credit, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting (other than vesting in equity
compensation awards granted after the Effective Time) and benefit accrual
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under such
Parent Employee Plans, for his or her

  



        
   

  



  

full and partial years of service with Company prior to the Effective Time;
(2) to the extent commercially reasonable, Parent shall give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under any
Parent Employee Plan for the plan year in which the First Effective Time
occurs, to amounts paid or incurred by such Continuing Employees during such
year under comparable Company Employee Plans; and (3) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any Parent Employee Plan to
be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained herein will obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or
any Affiliate of either to retain any Company Employees for any specific
period or to maintain any levels of compensation or benefit plans or
arrangements for the Company Employees for any specific period after the
Closing; it being understood that no Company Employee is intended to or will
receive by reason of this Agreement any direct or third party
beneficiary rights against Parent, Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
either.

  



  

(d) On and after the Closing, Parent shall maintain and fulfill or cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain and fulfill, all obligations under the
Change in Control Agreements. To the extent that after the Closing Date, any
Company employee who is a party to any such amended agreement fails to
satisfy the requirements needed to earn a retention payment in accordance
therewith, Parent shall and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
reallocate the retention amount allocated to such employee to the
other employees who maintained their eligibility to receive a retention
payment in accordance therewith (on a pro rata basis based on each such
employees initially allocated retention amount relative to the total
retention amounts available to all employees that are parties to such amended
agreements and still eligible to receive their retention amounts).

  



  

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company will cause its Board of Directors to
adopt resolutions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan and the self-funded
dental plan described at Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
contingent upon the Closing, and the Company shall make the filing described
at Schedule 6.4(e).  Following the date of such termination, no contributions
will be made to the Company 401(k) Plan other than contributions that have
been accrued on behalf of participants prior to the termination or are
otherwise based on compensation earned before the termination.  Such
resolutions will provide (to the extent required under Section 411 of the
Code) that all participants will be fully vested in their account balances
under the Company 401(k) Plan, will authorize distributions of Company 401(k)
Plan balances to participants as soon as practicable following the receipt of
a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering
the termination, and otherwise will be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay in full the 2008 Performance
Bonuses.

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## 6.5 Tax Matters.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Tax Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Options, such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Common Stock or
Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Tax Indemnification_. The Significant Shareholders shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons and hold them
harmless from and against any Damages attributable to (i) all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Company for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date
for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
(" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company (or
any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar law, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing; provided, however, that (x) the Significant Shareholders
shall not be liable for and shall not reimburse for any Taxes excluded from
the calculation of current liabilities pursuant to the parenthetical within
clause (B)(1) of the defined term "Net Working Capital," (y) shall be
liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the net amount, if any,
reserved for such Taxes on the face of the Closing Date Balance Sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto) and taken into account in determining the
Adjustment Amount. The Significant Shareholders shall reimburse the Parent
Indemnified Persons for any Damages incurred by them that are attributable to
Taxes of the Company that are the responsibility of Significant Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) within fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt by the Significant Shareholders of Parents written request therefor.
To the extent the Significant Shareholders are required to reimburse the
Parent Indemnified Persons for any such Damages, the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall be required to first exhaust the Indemnity Portion of the
Escrow Fund as their sole source of recovery for such Damages prior to
pursuing any recovery directly from the Significant Shareholders.
Parent shall promptly remit to the Shareholders Agent, for further
distribution to the Significant Shareholders in accordance with their
respective Significant Shareholder Percentage Interests, the amount (if any)
by which the liability accrued by the Company pursuant to clause (B)(4) of
the defined term "Net Working Capital" ultimately exceeds the amount of
Parents actual accrual therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount
of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing

  



        
   

  



  

### Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership
or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other
Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Significant Shareholders, Parent and Company shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in

partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The Significant Shareholders, Parent and Company agree (A) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Significant Shareholders, Parent or Company, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (B) to give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
the Significant Shareholders, Parent or Company, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

  

### 

  

### (ii) The Significant Shareholders, Parent and Company further agree, upon
request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including without limitation any Tax with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

  



  

### (iii) The Significant Shareholders, Parent and Company further agree,
upon request, to provide the other party with all information that either
party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code, and all
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

### (e) _Tax Returns_.  Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company required to be
filed after the Closing Date. Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period which are filed pursuant to this Section 6.5(e) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior tax accounting practices and methods used by the
Company (except to the extent counsel for Parent determines there is no
reasonable basis in law therefor or determines that such Tax Return cannot be
so prepared and filed or an item so reported without being subject
to penalties). In the event that the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns
would form the basis for a claim of indemnification pursuant to Section
6.5(b) or Section 9.2, Parent shall provide the portion of such Tax Returns
relevant to Company to the Shareholders Agent for review and comment at
least fifteen (15) days prior to

Returns without the consent of the Shareholders Agent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

similar agreements or arrangements with respect to or involving the Company

Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

Time, Parent shall cause Company to maintain a "run-off" or "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy to the current policy of the
Company, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing and
having the same coverage limits and other terms and conditions no less
favorable to each director and officer (and former director and officer) of
Company than the terms and conditions of the current policy of Company.

  

## 

  

## 6.7 _No Solicitation by Company or Significant Shareholders_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Without the prior written consent of Parent, neither Company nor any
Significant Shareholder shall, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, shareholder, employee or Representative of Company, solicit or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the initiation
or submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding any
acquisition, merger, sale of substantial assets, sale of controlling interest
in Company through a sale or issuance of Company Common Stock or similar
transactions involving Company (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals
being referred to herein as a " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ "); provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the board of
directors of Company from referring any third party to this Section 6.7.

  

### 

  

### (b) Company shall promptly notify Parent after receipt of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to
Company in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal or for access
to the properties, books or records of Company by any Person in connection
with a Company Acquisition Proposal.

be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be
cured).

  

### 

  

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Company, Merger Sub or any Significant Shareholder, or their respective
officers, directors or shareholders, except to the extent that such liability
results from the breach by a party of any of its covenants, agreements and
representations set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that
the provisions of Section 10 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

# 9. __Escrow and Indemnification__

  



  

## 9.1 _Escrow Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall withhold the Escrow Fund,
from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement
to the Significant Shareholders, and shall deposit the Escrow Fund with the
Escrow Agent on behalf of such Significant Shareholders. The Indemnity

 indemnifying the Parent Indemnified Persons (as defined below) pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, and (ii)

recovery prior to pursuing any other remedies or sources of recovery, to the

Plans), 3.26 (Brokers and Finders Fees) and 3A.2 (Power and Authority),
hereof shall survive the Closing until all claims relating to the subject
matter thereof shall have been barred by the relevant statutes of limitations
(the date of termination of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
being a " _Representation Termination Date_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_
that if at any time prior to the relevant Representation Termination Date,
Parent delivers to the Shareholders Agent a notice stating the existence of
a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Company or any
Significant Shareholder or a breach of a covenant made by Company or any
Significant Shareholder (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
Parents determination that such breach exists and a good faith estimate of
the amount of the Damages incurred or that may be incurred by a Parent
Indemnified Person as a result of such breach) and asserting a claim
for recovery (to the extent practicable) under this Section 9.2 based on
such breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive such
applicable Representation Termination Date until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. All obligations of the parties under the
covenants contained herein

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### (including the covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6) shall survive in
accordance with their terms.

respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors
in interest and assigns (each of the foregoing being referred to
individually as an " _Parent Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as "
_Parent Indemnified Persons_ ") shall be entitled to be indemnified by the
Significant Shareholders, jointly and severally (except for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of a Significant Shareholder, for which
Damages shall be borne entirely by such breaching Significant Shareholder,
after exhaustion of the Indemnity Portion of the Escrow Fund, up to the
Significant Shareholder Percentage Interest of the Merger Consideration for
each Significant Shareholder), for Damages actually incurred by such Parent
Indemnified Person as a result of:

  

### 

  

### (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Company set forth in
Section 3 or any representation or warranty of any Significant Shareholder in
Section 3A,

  

### 

  

### (ii) the breach of any pre-Closing covenant of Company or any pre- or
post-Closing covenant of any Significant Shareholder in this Agreement,

  

### 

  

### (iii) Parents reliance upon the written instructions or directions of
the Shareholders Agent,

Option in accordance with the terms hereof and of any applicable Option
Cancellation Certificate,

  

### 

  

### (vi) any inaccuracy in the calculation of Company Debt, Company Cash or

### For purposes of this Section 9, " _Damages_ " shall mean any liabilities,
losses, damages, penalties, fines, costs or expenses, including reasonable
legal, expert and consultant fees and expenses, but excluding any special,
indirect, consequential, exemplary and punitive damages and also excluding
any damages associated with any lost profits, lost opportunities or claims
for

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### diminution in value; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
computing the amount of any Damages incurred by a Parent Indemnified Person:
(1) there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit
actually received or receivable by any Parent Indemnified Person in
connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto;
(2) there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements
actually received or receivable by any Parent Indemnified Person in
connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.
Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such insurance proceeds.

  

### 

  

### Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9, with respect
to the items described in paragraph 4 of Schedule 9.2(b)(ix) and the last
sentence of Section 6.5(b), no Parent Indemnified Party shall pay any such
Taxes, penalties, interest or other amounts to any Foreign Jurisdiction or
remit any payments to the Significant Shareholders under the last sentence of
Section 6.5(b), until (x) Parent has provided the Shareholders Agent with a
reasonably detailed description of the legal and factual basis for the amount
claimed or determined to be owing, and (y) a procedure similar to the one
outlined in Section 2.13(c) of this Agreement has been followed (including,
without limitation, a 30-day review and comment right for Shareholders
Agent, the provision of all materials, analysis and work papers supporting
the Parents determination of the amount claimed or determined to be owing
and submission to an independent accountant in the event of any dispute).

  

### 

  

### (c) _Limitations of Liability_.

  



  

#### (i) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to Section 10.10 hereof, the
right of the Parent Indemnified Persons to be indemnified pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect
to all damages or losses of whatever kind and nature, in law, equity or
otherwise, known or unknown, which such parties have now or may have in the
future attributable to any breach of any representation or warranty, or any
breach of or failure to perform the covenants, agreements or
undertakings contained in this Agreement, any disclosure schedule or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto or any agreement or other document
contemplated hereby, other than as a result of actual fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company. The parties acknowledge that (A) except as
expressly provided in Section 3 and Section 3A, neither the Company nor any
Significant Shareholder has made and is not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, and (B) except as expressly provided in Section 3 and Section 3A,
Parent is not relying and has not relied on, any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Basket_. Without limiting the effect of any other limitation
contained in this Section 9, except for the representations and warranties at
Section 3.3 (Power and Authority), 3.8 (Capitalization), 3.21 (Taxes), 3.22
(Employee Benefit Plans), 3.26 (Brokers and Finders Fees), 3.32 (Accounts
Receivable) and 3A.2 (Power and Authority), the indemnification provided for
in Section 9.2(b)(i) and (ii) shall not apply, and the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification rights
thereunder, except to the extent that the aggregate amount of the Damages
against which such Parent Indemnified Persons would otherwise be entitled to
be indemnified under this Section 9 exceeds

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### $750,000 (the " _Basket_ "). If the aggregate amount of such Damages
exceeds the Basket, then the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the
other limitations contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified with
respect to all such Damages, including the amount of the Basket.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Cap_. Except as set forth in Section 9.2(c)(iv), and except for
the representations and warranties at Section 3.3 (Power and Authority), 3.8
(Capitalization), 3.21 (Taxes), 3.22 (Employee Benefit Plans), 3.26 (Brokers
and Finders Fees), 3.32 (Accounts Receivable) and 3A.2 (Power and
Authority), the Significant Shareholders indemnity obligations for
Damages under Section 9(b)(i) and (ii) shall be limited, in the aggregate,
to an amount equal to $17,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "). The sum of any amounts
paid from the Indemnity Portion of the Escrow Fund to Parent Indemnified
Persons in connection with any Indemnifiable Damages (as defined below) shall
be counted toward the Cap for the purposes of this Section 9.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) _Fraud; Intentional Misrepresentation_. Nothing in this Section
9.2(c) shall limit any remedy Parent Indemnified Person may have against any
Person for fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by such Person
under applicable laws.

  

#### 

  

### (d) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. In the event Parent or another
Parent Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third party claim (any such
claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which Parent believes may result in a claim
for indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by or on behalf
of a Parent Indemnified Person, Parent shall promptly notify the
Shareholders Agent of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no delay in providing such notice shall affect a Parent Indemnified Persons
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Shareholders
Agent or the Former Shareholders (including the Significant Shareholders) are
materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a reasonably
detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and amount, if
then reasonably ascertainable, of such Damages that may be indemnifiable ("
_Indemnifiable Damages_ "). The obligations of the Shareholders Agent under
this Section with respect to Indemnifiable Damages arising from any Third
Party Claim shall be governed by the following additional terms
and conditions:

  

### 

  

#### (i) The Shareholders Agent, at its option, shall be entitled to assume
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim at any time within thirty
(30) days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim from Parent and may
appoint as lead counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the
Shareholders Agent and reasonably approved by Parent. In the event that the
Shareholders Agent assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Shareholders Agent shall keep Parent and the Parent Indemnified Person
(if such Parent Indemnified Person is not Parent) informed of all material
events and developments, including promptly providing copies of any
correspondence and court filings, with respect to such Third Party Claim and
the expenses of the Shareholders Agent shall be reimbursed from the
Shareholders Agent Expense Portion of the Escrow Fund.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Notwithstanding Section 9.2(d)(i) above, the Parent Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that such
employment shall be at the Parent Indemnified Persons own expense unless (i)
the Shareholders Agent has failed to assume (or elects not to assume) the
defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 9.2(d)(i), 

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Shareholders Agent and the Parent
Indemnified Person and, in the opinion of counsel to the Parent Indemnified
Person reasonably approved by Shareholders Agent, there is an actual
conflict of interest between the Shareholders Agent and the
Parent Indemnified Person or (iii) the Parent Indemnified Person determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that such Third Party
Claim seeks material non-monetary relief, in which case the Parent
Indemnified Person shall have the right, by notice to the Shareholders
Agent, to assume defense of such claim and the reasonable fees and expenses
of the Parent Indemnified Persons counsel incurred in connection with such
Third Party Claim shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages; _provided_
_,_ _however_ _,_ that if it is ultimately determined by agreement of
the Shareholders Agent and the Parent Indemnified Person or by a binding
court order or final decision of a mutually selected arbitrator that the
Parent Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder with
respect to the Third Party Claim such fees and expenses shall _not_ be
Indemnifiable Damages.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Neither the Shareholders Agent nor the Parent Indemnified Person
shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

#### 

  

### (e) _Subrogation_. To the extent that a Parent Indemnified Person
receives an indemnification payment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
the Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to exercise, and shall
be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity,
rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that Parent or any of
Parents Subsidiaries or other Affiliates may have against any other Person
with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such
indemnification is directly or indirectly related.

  

### 

  

## 9.3 _Shareholders  Agent_.

  



  

### (a) By virtue of the approval of this Agreement by Companys
shareholders, and without further action of any Company shareholder, each
Former Shareholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and

hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact ("
_Shareholders  Agent_") for and on behalf of the Former Shareholders,
including the Significant Shareholders, with full power of substitution, to

the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the
Shareholders Agent of any and all actions and the making of any decisions

payments to the Former Shareholders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (vii) take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the good faith judgment of the Shareholders Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing.  The power of attorney granted in this
Section 9.3 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated
by the Shareholders Agent and shall survive the death or incapacity of any
Former Shareholder. The identity of the Shareholders Agent and the terms of
the agency may be changed, and a successor Shareholders Agent may be
appointed, from time to time (including in the event of the death, disability
or other incapacity of the Shareholders Agent) by Former Shareholders whose
aggregate Percentage Interests exceed 50%, and any such successor shall
succeed the Shareholders Agent as Shareholders Agent hereunder. No bond
shall be required of the Shareholders Agent, and the Shareholders Agent
shall receive no compensation for his services.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable to the Former
Shareholders for any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense
incurred without gross negligence by the Shareholders Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of his or her reasonable judgment and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his or her
duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith).
The Shareholders Agent Expense Portion of the Escrow Fund shall be available
to indemnify and hold the Shareholders Agent harmless against any
liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the
Shareholders Agent without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to recover any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Shareholders Agent in
connection with actions taken by the Shareholders Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of
legal counsel and financial, tax or accounting advisors and the incurring of
any fees and costs related thereto and any expenses related to
the Independent Accounting Firm) from the Shareholders Agent Expense Portion
of the Escrow Fund, without the requirement of any consent or approval by
Parent.

  

### 

  

### (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Shareholders Agent with reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the officers and employees of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in each
case to the extent reasonably necessary for purposes of performing his duties
and exercising his rights under this Agreement, provided that the
Shareholders Agent shall treat confidentially any nonpublic information he
receives from Parent regarding the Surviving Corporation (except as
reasonably necessary in connection with the performance by the Shareholders
Agent of his duties or the exercise of his rights under this Agreement).

  

### 

  

### (d) The Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to no compensation for his
service in such capacity.

  

### 

  

## 9.4 _Actions of the Shareholders  Agent_. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent
shall constitute a decision of all Former Shareholders, including
the Significant Shareholders, and shall be final, binding and

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## conclusive upon each Former Shareholder, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely upon any decision, act, written consent or written instruction of
the Shareholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each Former Shareholder. Parent and Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved
from any liability to any Person for any acts done by Shareholders Agent and
any acts done by Parent or Surviving Corporation in accordance with any such
decision, act, written consent or written instruction of the Shareholders
Agent.

  

## 

  

## 9.5 _Tax Matters_. The parties agree that any amounts released to any
Parent Indemnified Person from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate consideration paid in
connection with the Merger for federal income tax purposes. All interest and
other income earned on the Escrow Fund (net of any losses) will be retained
by the Escrow Agent and added to and become part of the Escrow Fund. The
parties hereto agree that all income, gain, loss and deductions derived from
the investment of the Escrow Fund shall be taken into account for income tax
purposes by the Significant Shareholders.

more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been

## 

  

## 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_.
This Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant
hereto, including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the other schedules hereto: (a) together constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties

its terms and shall survive any termination of this Agreement; (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as provided in the final sentence of this Section 10.4; and (c)
shall not be assigned by Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or by Company
or the Significant Shareholders, on the other hand (by operation of law or
otherwise), without the written consent of each of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that such consent shall not be necessary for (1) an
assignment by Parent or Merger Sub of their rights and obligations hereunder
to an Affiliate of Parent so long as such assignment does not relieve Parent
of its obligations hereunder, or (2)

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## any collateral assignment by Parent or Merger Sub of their rights
and obligations hereunder to any lender under credit and collateral
agreements, as such agreements may be amended, modified or replaced from time
to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(but without limiting any of the rights of the Shareholders Agent
hereunder), if the Merger is consummated, (i) the Company Holders shall be
third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Section 2, and (ii)
the Companys former officers and directors shall be third party

void or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise affected and will
continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
9.2(c) or elsewhere herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

  

## 

  

## 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia applicable
to parties residing in the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to
applicable principles of conflicts of law.  Each of the parties irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts located
Fairfax County, Virginia and the federal courts located in the City of
Alexandria, Virginia, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and agrees that
process may be served upon it in any manner authorized by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia for such persons and waives and covenants not to
assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction and such process. Each of the Parent, Merger Sub,
Company, Surviving Corporation and each Company Holder, including the
Significant Shareholders, irrevocably and unconditionally waives the right to
trial by jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## 

  

## 10.8 _Attorney-Client Privilege_. At and after the Effective Time, the
attorney-work privilege of the Company with Cooley Godward Kronish LLP
related to the transactions contemplated hereby for the period prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be the right of the Company Holders, and
not that of the Company, and may be waived only by the Shareholders Agent.
Absent such consent of the Shareholders Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), following the Effective Time,
neither the Parent nor the Company shall have a right to access attorney-
client privileged material of the Company related to the transactions
contemplated hereby for the period prior to the Effective Time.

  



         
 

  

## 

  

## 10.9 _Rules of Construction_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

### 

  

### (b) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires:  the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include the masculine and feminine genders.

  

###

rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" and

to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific section of
this Agreement.

## 10.10 _Time is of the Essence; Enforcement_. Time is of the essence of
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the covenants of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the covenants of this Agreement and to
