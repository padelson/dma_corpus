rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except as otherwise
provided herein.

  



  

7.7 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement, or the application thereof, shall be
declared invalid, void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid, void or unenforceable provision
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, void or
unenforceable provision.

  



  

7.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party agrees
to pay, without right of reimbursement from the other party, the costs
incurred by it incident to the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, costs incident to the preparation of this
Agreement, and the fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants and
consultants employed by such party in connection herewith.

  



  

7.9 _Headings_. The table of contents and the section and other
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

7.10 _Other Remedies; Injunctive Relief_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
subject to Section 7.13 hereof, the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court in the state of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In any action at law or suit in equity to
enforce this Agreement or the rights of the parties hereunder, the prevailing
party in any such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable
sum for its attorneys' fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in such action or suit.

  



  

7.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures
shall be deemed valid and binding.

  



  

7.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement has been entered into and shall
be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without reference to the choice of law principles thereof.

7.13 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. This Agreement shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware. The parties to
this Agreement agree that any breach of any term or condition of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach occurring in the State of Delaware
by virtue of a failure to perform an act required to be performed in the State
of Delaware and irrevocably and expressly agree to submit to the jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Delaware for the purpose of resolving any
disputes among the parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or any judgment entered by any court in respect hereof
brought in the State of Delaware, and further irrevocably waive any claim
that any suit, action or proceeding brought in the State of Delaware has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  



  

7.14 _Participation of Parties_. The parties hereby agree that they
have consulted their respective counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding, or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

  



  

7.15 _Further Assurances_. The parties hereto shall deliver any and
all other instruments or documents reasonably required to be
delivered pursuant to, or necessary or proper in order to give effect to, all
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation,
all necessary stock powers and such other instruments of transfer as may be
necessary or desirable to transfer full and complete ownership of the Sold
NVPL Stock to the Company or the issuance of the applicable Securities to the
Investors for the Consideration, as the case may be, free and clear of any
liens or encumbrances.

  



  

7.16 _Publicity_. No public announcement or other publicity concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be made
without the prior written consent of both the Company and Investor as to
form, content, timing and manner of distribution. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent any party from making any filing required by federal or state
securities laws or stock exchange rules of the United States of America.

  



  

7.17 _No Solicitation_. None of NVPL, Investor nor the Company shall
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, agents,
representatives, managers, members, agents, or advisors to solicit, initiate
or encourage or take any action to facilitate the submission of
inquiries, proposals or offers from any person relating to any matter
concerning any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving NVPL or the Company,
respectively, other than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
or any other transaction the consummation of which would or could reasonably
be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or delay the Exchange or which
would or could be expected to dilute the benefits to each of the parties of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Investor and the Company will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing.
