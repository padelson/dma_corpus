agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent
and unconditional and, except with respect to the termination of its

written notice to the Earn-Out Guarantor of Parents failure to pay any such
Earn-Out Amount when due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

the Earn-Out Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against the
Parent or any such guarantor (if any) and whether or not the Parent or any
such guarantor (if any) is joined in any such action or actions (but in any
event, subject to the other terms of this Section 2.03(b)(iv) including the
proviso to the last sentence of Section 2.03(b)(iv)(A) and the conditions

14.14 as the Earn-Out Guarantor hereunder, and (cc) shall expressly make
the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.03(b)(iv),
applied _mutatis mutandis_ to such Person. Upon any consolidation or
amalgamation of the Earn-Out Guarantor with, or merger of the Earn-Out

all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Earn-
Out Guarantor in accordance with this Section 2.03(b)(iv)(C), the successor
or resulting Person formed by or resulting upon such consolidation or
amalgamation or into which the Earn-Out Guarantor is merged or to which such
conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Earn-Out Guarantor under
this Agreement with the same effect as if such successor Person had been
named as the Earn-Out Guarantor herein, and thereafter the predecessor Person
shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Agreement and

Earn-out Amount(s)) among the assets and liabilities of the Group Entities in
a manner reasonably determined by the Member Representative in accordance with
Sections 734, 743, 751 and 755 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder;
provided, that (i) the Member Representative shall allocate no less than the
GAAP book value shown on the Group Balance Sheet to any assets classified as

less than the value taken into account pursuant to Section 2.14(c) to any
balance sheet items taken into account in the Final Adjusted Purchase Price,
(ii) the Member Representative shall consider in good faith any reasonable

if it concludes that the allocation is unreasonable and may only make such
changes to the allocation as it determines are necessary to render the
allocation reasonable. The determination and allocation of the Closing Merger
Consideration and other amounts derived pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.11_ shall be binding on the parties hereto for all Tax reporting purposes.

Section 2.12.  _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each Acquired Entity, Parent and their respective

otherwise payable to any Person pursuant

 



40  to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment pursuant to any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign tax law. If any Acquired Entity, Parent or one of
their respective agents, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and pays
such amounts to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Holdings Pre-Closing Interests in respect of which the applicable Acquired
Entity, Parent or the agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding. Each of the Acquired Entity, Parent and their respective agents,
as appropriate, shall, within a reasonable time prior to any such deduction
and withholding, notify the Person of its intention to withhold and furnish
all information reasonably required by such Person to ascertain how such
withholding may be mitigated and, if necessary, to contest such withholding.

Section 2.13. _Payment and Issuance Procedures_.

(a) _Member Documents_. The Member Representative has, prior to the date
hereof, delivered to Rollover Holdco and each Member a letter of transmittal
and general release in substantially the form set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ G_
(" _Letter of Transmittal_ ").

 

(b) _Payment_ _of Merger Consideration_. If the Closing is consummated and a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed by Rollover Holdco
or a Member (including each Direct Rollover Member) in accordance with the
instructions (together with such other customary documents as are specified in
the Letter of Transmittal) has been received by the Member Representative,
such Person shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.04(c)_ with respect to all Holdings Pre-Closing Interests issuable thereto
in connection with the Restructuring and surrendered pursuant to such Letter
of Transmittal, and the Holdings Pre-Closing Interests so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If the Closing is consummated, all Holdings Pre-Closing
Interests issuable to the Holdings Pre-Closing Members in connection with the
Restructuring shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.04(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)_. If a Letter of Transmittal (duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (together
with such other customary documents as are specified in the Letter of
Transmittal)) is properly delivered by Rollover Holdco or a Member to the
Member Representative not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (or less if such payment is agreed to by prior written consent of
Parent), then (A) the Member Representative will pay such Members Closing
Cash Consideration (if any) in immediately available funds as promptly as
practicable after receipt of the Closing Cash Consideration by the Member
Representative at the Closing and (B) upon the consummation of the Closing,
with respect to Rollover Holdco and the Direct Rollover Members, Rollover
Holdco and the Direct Rollover Members shall become the record owners of Class
A Holdings Interests representing the Closing Rollover Consideration to be
issued to Rollover Holdco and the Direct Rollover Members upon the
consummation of the Closing. If a Letter of Transmittal is properly delivered
by a Member to the Member Representative less than three Business Days prior
to the Closing or following the Closing Date, then the Member Representative
will pay to such Member such Members Closing Cash Consideration (if any) in
immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business Days following
such delivery. The Member Representative has provided Parent with all Letters
of Transmittal received by the

 



41  Member Representative as of three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, and the Member Representative shall promptly provide Parent with any
additional Letters of Transmittal received by the Member Representative at
least three (3) Business Days prior (or less if such earlier payment is agreed
to by prior written consent of Parent) to the Member Representative making any
payment with respect to such Letters of Transmittal. For the avoidance of
doubt, upon satisfaction of its obligations under Section 2.10(d)(i), Parent
shall not be responsible for payment with respect to any individual Letter of
Transmittal (other than any payment obligations to the Member Representative
(for example purposes only, any payment required to be made by Parent to the
Member Representative under Section 2.14(c)(i)), if any, required to occur
following the Closing as set forth in this Agreement).

 

Section 2.14. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Member Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ ") of its good faith determination of the following: (i) Closing
Net Working Capital, (ii) Closing Indebtedness (which shall include the amount
of any Payoff Debt), (iii) the Balance Sheet Adjustment, (iv) Transaction
Expenses, (v) the Adjusted Purchase Price, and (vi) the Cash Purchase Price.
In connection with Parents preparation of the Post-Closing Statement,
Holdings, the Management Sellers and Member Representative shall afford, and
shall cause each Acquired Entity and its Subsidiaries to afford, to Parent and
any Representatives retained by Parent in connection with the preparation of
the Post-Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.14, full access
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the
properties, books, contracts, personnel, Representatives (including the
accountants of the Acquired Entities) and records of the Acquired
Entities, each Subsidiary of the Acquired Entities and such Representatives
(including, in the event Parent and its applicable Representatives shall sign
a release and non-reliance letter in a form customarily requested by the
accountants of the Acquired Entities, the work papers of the accountants of
the Acquired Entities) relevant to the preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement and calculation of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price in accordance
with this Section 2.14. For the avoidance of doubt, the Management Sellers
shall cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in connection with any
reasonable requests by Parent or its Representatives in connection with
Parents preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and calculation of the
Final Adjusted Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.14.

(b) The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date on which the Post-
Closing Statement was delivered to the Member Representative, unless the
Member Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement with the
Post-Closing Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Parent prior to
such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail
the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include
good faith disagreements based on the components of the Post-Closing Statement
not being mathematically correct or prepared in accordance with this Section
2.14 and the definitions of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
(which shall include the amount of any Payoff Debt), Balance Sheet Adjustment,
Transaction Expenses, Adjusted Purchase Price and Cash Purchase Price (and
the definitions in such definitions). If a Notice of Disagreement is received
by Parent in a timely manner, then the Post-Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) 

 



42  shall become final and binding upon the Members and Parent on the earlier of
(i) the date the Member Representative and Parent resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.14(b)_.
During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Member Representative and Parent shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such thirty
(30)-day period the Member Representative and Parent have not resolved in
writing the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Member
Representative and Parent shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the
" _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.14(b)_, only such matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be
Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by the Member Representative and Parent in writing. The Member
Representative and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the
Accounting Firm within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of such
submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the
items in dispute were determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.14_ and the definitions of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
(which shall include the amount of any Payoff Debt), Balance Sheet Adjustment,
Transaction Expenses, Adjusted Purchase Price and Cash Purchase Price (and
the definitions in such definitions), and the Accounting Firm is not to make
any other determination not disputed in such Notice of Disagreement. The
Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on written submissions by
the Member Representative and Parent and their respective representatives and
not by independent review and shall be final and binding on all of the parties
hereto. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.14(b)_ shall be borne by the Members (payable first out of the Expense
Holdback Amount), on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in
proportion to the final allocation made by such Accounting Firm of the
disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by the Member
Representative and Parent, such that the prevailing party pays the lesser
proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if Parent claims
that the appropriate adjustments are, in the aggregate, $1,000 greater than
the amount determined by the Members and if the Accounting Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to Parent an aggregate of $300 of
the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
will be allocated 30% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Members and 70% ( _i.e._
, 700 ÷ 1,000) to Parent.

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Adjusted Purchase Price_ "
means the Adjusted Purchase Price as finally agreed or determined in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.14(a) or (b)_.

 



43 (i) If the Final Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Adjusted
Purchase Price, within five (5) Business Days after such Final Adjusted
Purchase Price is finally determined, (x) Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds equal to sixty two and one-half percent (62.5%)
of the amount of such excess to the Member Representative for the benefit of
and distribution to the Members, and (y) Parent and the Member Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, a wire transfer in an
amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Member
Representative for the benefit of and distribution to the Members, which
amounts (in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y)) shall be allocated by the
Member Representative in accordance with the Restructuring Agreement based on
the Balance Sheet Adjustment Allocation with respect to each Member (as the
same shall be adjusted to give effect to the Final Adjusted Purchase Price).

(ii) If the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Final Adjusted
Purchase Price, Parent and the Member Representative shall, within five (5)
Business Days after such Final Adjusted Purchase Price is determined, deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release, in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (x) a wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Parent or another Person designated by Parent from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
sixty two and one-half percent (62.5%) of such excess and the (B) the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, and in the event the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund is less than such excess amount, Parent may also proceed (aa)
first, against the Indemnity Escrow Fund for the amount of such shortfall (and
Parent and the Member Representative shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to release such amount), and (bb) then, in the event the
Indemnity Escrow Fund is less than such remaining excess amount, against the
Members, severally and not jointly (in accordance with the Holdings Allocation
Percentage of each such Member) in order to recover the amount by which the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if
applicable, is less than such excess, and (y) a wire transfer in an amount
equal to any remaining portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund
(if any) to the Member Representative for the benefit of and distribution to
the Members, which amount shall be allocated by the Member Representative in

be expected to impair or delay in any material respect such Acquired Entitys
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party or to consummate the

in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 11.01. _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
parties hereto agree to treat the Merger and the Transactions, with respect
to the Members, as a sale to Parent of Holdings Pre-Closing Interests for cash
to the extent of the cash consideration received by the Members hereunder
followed by a redemption of the Redeemable Holdings Interests. Parent shall
cause Holdings to allocate all items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit attributable to the taxable period of Holdings in which the Closing
occurs based on a closing of Holdings books as of the end of the Closing
Date. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any Transaction Tax
Deductions shall be treated as accruing on or prior to the Closing Date and
shall be allocated to the taxable period of the Holdings that ends or
is deemed to end on the Closing Date, and Parent shall not be allocated and
shall not claim any such Transaction Tax Deductions. No party shall take a
position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority or in any
proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent with the Tax treatment
described in this paragraph without the prior written consent of all of the
other parties or unless specifically required pursuant to a determination by
an applicable Governmental Authority.

 

Section 11.02. _Tax Returns_. All Acquired Entity Returns that relate to any
Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date shall be prepared and
filed by Holdings in a manner reasonably determined by the Member
Representative and consistent with each Acquired Entitys and each of its
Subsidiarys past practice except as otherwise required by the provisions
of this Agreement or as otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Transactions result in a deemed
partnership termination pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, an
election under Section 754 of the Code shall be made with respect to the
predecessor partnership. Except as provided in this Agreement, without the
prior written consent of the Member Representative, Parent shall not file any
amended Acquired Entity Return or make any Tax election with respect to any
Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law. Acquired Entity Returns that relate to any Tax period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date (such period, a " _Straddle
Period_ ", and such Acquired Entity Returns, " _Straddle Period Returns_ ")
shall be prepared and filed by Holdings (A) in a manner reasonably determined
by the Member Representative with respect to the pre-Closing portion of such
Straddle Period Return to the extent that items in the post-Closing portion of
the Straddle Period or subsequent periods are not affected and (B) in all
cases, consistent with each Acquired Entitys and each Subsidiary of an
Acquired Entitys past practice except as otherwise required by the provisions
of this Agreement or AandR Holdings LLC Agreement or as otherwise required by a
change in Applicable Law.

 

Section 11.03. _Transfer Taxes_. 50% of actual Transfer Taxes paid or required
to be paid in connection with the Transactions (including any real property
transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be deemed Transaction Expenses in
accordance with the definition thereof, and the remaining 50% shall be borne
by Parent; provided, however, that Parents liability to pay Transfer Taxes
hereunder shall in no event exceed $200,000, and the entire amount of Transfer
Taxes in excess of $400,000 shall be deemed Transaction Expenses. Parent will
file, or cause to be filed, all necessary Tax Returns with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes and will pay or cause to be paid all such Transfer
Taxes.

 



96 Section 11.04. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent and the Holdings Pre-
Closing Members shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of
any Tax Return, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Holdings shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Acquired Entities and the Subsidiaries relating to pre-
closing periods until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority for all periods required by such Taxing Authority, and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Members with at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice before destroying any such books and
records, during which period any Member that so requests can elect to take
possession, at their own expense, of a copy of such books and records.

 

Section 11.05. _FIRPTA Certificate and W-9_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
the Holdings Pre-Closing Members or the Acquired Entities, as applicable,
shall deliver to Parent IRS Forms W-9 and certificates in compliance with
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2 or 1.1445-11T(d)(2), as applicable,
certifying that the Transactions are exempt from withholding under Section
1445 of the Code; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parents sole right if the Members or the Acquired
Entities, as applicable, fail to provide such certificates shall be to make an
appropriate withholding of Tax. Parent agrees that, if on or before the
Closing Date it receives the statements described in this Section 11.05, no
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code is required in connection with the
transactions described in Article 2\.

 

Section 11.06. _754 Elections_. The Holdings Pre-Closing Members and Parent
shall cause Holdings (i) to make valid elections under Section 754 of the
Code, effective for the taxable years of Holdings and 632 N. Dearborn
Operations, LLC including the Closing Date and (ii) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to make a valid election under Section 754 of the Code,
effective for the taxable year of IP BISC LLC including the Closing Date.

 

Section 11.07. _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Member Representative shall control the conduct, through counsel
of its own choosing and at the expense of the Holdings Pre-Closing Members, of
any Proceeding with respect to Taxes of an Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary
thereof, in each case, relating to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the Member
Representative shall not settle or compromise any such Proceeding in a manner
that would adversely affect the Tax Liability of any Acquired Entity or
Parent or any of its Affiliates for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
following the Closing without the consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) with respect to any
such Proceeding that relates to a Tax period beginning before and ending after
the Closing

 



97  Date, (A) the AandR Holdings LLC Agreement shall govern the conduct of such
Proceeding and (B) the Member Representative and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate to sever the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of any such
Proceeding, if possible, or to treat such Proceeding as severed for purposes
of exercising their rights under this Section 11.07.

 

Section 11.08. _Refunds_. Holdings shall, within ten (10) days after the
receipt thereof, pay to the Member Representative for the benefit of and
distribution to the Members as allocated at the direction of the Member
Representative any net refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to any
Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary thereof that relate to a Tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (determined in a
manner consistent with the definition of Pre-Closing Taxes) in each case if
actually received, applied against, credited to, or used to offset Taxes;
provided, that, in each case, this sentence shall not apply to (a) any refund
or credit included in the calculation of Final Adjusted Purchase Price, and
(b) any refund or credit attributable to any Tax item or attribute arising
in a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Parent
will cooperate, and will cause each Acquired Entity and any Subsidiary thereof
to cooperate in using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Tax refund
that the Member Representative reasonably requests Holdings to obtain,
including through filing appropriate forms with the applicable Taxing
Authority.

_Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)_, (x) in
the aggregate, exceed the aggregate Closing Cash Consideration (including any
adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_), _plus_ any Earn-Out Amount(s)
actually paid in accordance with Section 2.03(b) (including by issuance of
Qualified MSG Stock or Qualified Successor Stock in accordance with Section
2.03(b)), _plus_ any distributions from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund received by the Members (or the Member Representative on behalf of the
Members) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or, (y) with respect to any
individual Member, exceed an amount equal to (A) the Purchase Price _plus_
any Earn-Out Amount(s) actually paid in accordance with Section 2.03(b)
(including by issuance of Qualified MSG Stock or Qualified Successor Stock in
accordance with Section 2.03(b)), _multiplied_  by (B) such Members Holdings
Allocation Percentage. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
foregoing clause (iii)(y), irrespective of whether a Member delivers a Letter
of Transmittal to the Member Representative, the limitation on
indemnification of a Parent Indemnitee with respect to the Members shall be
calculated as if such Member had submitted a Letter of Transmittal and such
Member had received its allocable portion of the Purchase Price (and any Earn-
Out Amount(s) actually paid in accordance with Section 2.03(b) (including by
issuance of Qualified MSG Stock or Qualified Successor Stock in accordance
with Section 2.03(b)) _multiplied_ by such Members Holdings Allocation
Percentage), and in the event of an indemnification obligation of such Member,
the Member Representative

 



102  shall pay the applicable amount out of the proceeds with respect to such
Member held by the Member Representative to the applicable Parent Indemnitee
notwithstanding the failure to receive such Letter of Transmittal but
otherwise subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to this _Section_ __ _
12.03_, the value of the Qualified MSG Stock or Qualified Successor Stock
will be equal to the value attributed at the time of issuance pursuant to
Section 2.03(b).

(b) With respect to indemnification of Parent Indemnitees by the Members for
Group Warranty Breaches and Member Warranty Breaches pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 12.02(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , other than
for fraud or for the inaccuracy or breach of the Fundamental Representations,
the Special Representations or the representations and warranties in Section
4.06(d), the Members shall not be liable (i) for any Group Warranty Breaches
or Member Warranty Breaches with respect to which the aggregate Damages
incurred by the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries, collectively, when
taken together with their aggregate Damages with respect to any related Group
Warranty Breach(es) or Member Warranty Breach(es), do not amount to more than
$35,000 (such related Group Warranty Breach(es) or Member Warranty Breach(es)
that do not exceed in the aggregate $35,000, a " _De_ _Minimis_ _Breach_ ")
(for the avoidance of doubt, solely for purposes of determining whether
Damages exceed $35,000 for determining a De Minimis Breach, and without taking
into consideration the fact that the Damages incurred by the Parent
Indemnitees may have been less in respect of any such Group Warranty Breaches
or Member Warranty Breaches) or (ii) unless the aggregate amount of Damages of
Parent Indemnitees with respect to all Group Warranty Breaches or Member
Warranty Breaches, other than De Minimis Breaches, exceeds $1,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only for amounts of Damages in excess of the
Deductible.

 

(c) With respect to indemnification by Parent for Parent Breaches pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.02(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , other than for fraud or for the
inaccuracy or breach of the Fundamental Representations (i) Parent shall not
be liable (A) for any Parent Warranty Breaches for which the Damages with
respect thereto, when taken together with the Damages with respect to any
related Parent Warranty Breaches, do not amount to more than $35,000 (such
Parent Warranty Breaches that do not exceed $35,000, a " _Parent De_ _Minimis_
_Breach_ ") or (B) unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all
Parent Warranty Breaches, other than Parent De Minimis Breaches, exceeds the
Deductible, and then only for amounts of Damages in excess of the Deductible,
and (y) the maximum liability for all Parent Warranty Breaches (except for
any inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental Representations) shall not
exceed the Business Cap and (z) the maximum liability for all Parent Breaches
shall not exceed the Cap.

 

(d) For purposes of indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ 12_, (i) each
of the representations and warranties that contain any qualifications as to
materiality, material or Group Material Adverse Effect (or any correlative
terms) (other than such qualifications in _Section_ __ _ 4.04(iv)_, _Section_
__ _ 4.07(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.08(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.08(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.24_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(iv)_, the definition of (except as provided in subclause
(iv) thereof) and references to "Material Contracts" and for the avoidance of
doubt, any dollar thresholds in _Section_ __ _ 4.09_ or _Section_ __ _
4.10(a))_, each of which shall not be disregarded) and (ii) the
representation and warranty in Section 4.05(a)(i) that contains qualification
as to de minimis failures, shall be deemed to have been given as though there
were no such qualifications in determining the Damages attributable to any
such breach or inaccuracy and in determining whether there has been any breach
of, or inaccuracy in, any representations or warranties hereunder.

 



103 (e) If a Parent Indemnitee becomes entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Sections _12.02(a)_ or _12.02(b)_ , except with respect to breaches of
the covenants and agreements made or to be performed pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.04_ (which shall only be paid directly by the applicable Principal(s)),
such indemnification payment will be made first out of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund and, in the event the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund is not
sufficient to satisfy such entitlement in full, in cash by the Indemnitor
(subject to the other terms of this _Article 12_)); _provided_ , solely in
the event the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund is not sufficient to satisfy
such entitlement in full, that in the case of an Indemnitor that is a Rollover

indemnification obligation is finally determined to

 



104  be due and payable; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the entire Principal
Amount is not paid prior to the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the

date, shall be due and payable by the Rollover Holdco Member Indemnitor by
either of the methods set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above (such
payment to be made in the sole discretion of the Parent Indemnitee), and/or
the Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to set off and withhold any amounts
owed or payable to such Rollover Holdco Member Indemnitor (whether under this
Agreement or another Transaction Document, other than an Employment Agreement)
in respect of such outstanding amount. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to any claim under Section
_12.02(a)_ or _12.02(b)_ other than breaches of the covenants and agreements
made or to be performed pursuant to _Section 7.04_ (which shall only be paid

employees of each Acquired Entity and each of their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.06_): (i) each of the Members, Management
Sellers, Rollover Holdco, Rollover Holdco Members, Direct Rollover Members,
Member Representative and Acquired Entities acknowledges and agrees that he,
she or it does not have any right of indemnification, contribution or
reimbursement from or remedy against Parent, Parent Merger Sub, or

Section 12.04. _Exclusive Remedy_. Without limiting the effect of any other
limitation set forth in this Agreement, other than for fraud or with respect
to any claims under Section 9.11 (which claims may only be brought in
accordance with Section 9.11(d) and with respect to breaches of Section 9.11)
or with respect to any claims under Section 2.03(b)(iv) (which claims may
only be brought in accordance with Section 2.03(b)(iv) and with respect to
breaches of Section 2.03(b)(iv)), from and after the consummation of the
Closing, the indemnification provisions of Section 12.02 (together with the
related provisions of the Escrow Agreement) shall, except with respect to
_Section_ __ _ 2.11_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.14_, be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of the parties following the consummation of the Closing for

any representations or warranties or breaches or alleged breaches of any
covenants or agreements of the parties in this Agreement, the
Restructuring Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal, the officer certificates
delivered pursuant to Section 2.10 or the Transactions (other than the
Employment Agreements and the AandR Holdings LLC Agreement).

 

Section 12.05. _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. Prior
to any applicable expiration date under Section 12.01, if an Indemnitee has
incurred Damages, other than in connection with a Third Party Claim (as
defined below), such Indemnitee shall promptly deliver to the applicable
Member(s) or Parent subject to an indemnity obligation to such Indemnitee
pursuant to Section 12.02 (an " _Indemnitor_ ") or, in the event the
Indemnitor is a Member, the Member Representative a notice signed by any
officer thereof (or in the event the Indemnitee is not an entity, signed by
the Indemnitee) (an " _Indemnity Notice_ ") (i) stating that such Indemnitee
has incurred Damages and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail (to the extent
available) the individual items of Damages included in the amount so stated
and the nature of the breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. After the giving of any Indemnity Notice, the amount of Damages to
which the Indemnitee shall be entitled in respect thereof shall be
determined: (x) by a written agreement between the Indemnitor and Indemnitee
expressly stating that it is an agreement made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
12.05_ or (y) by a final judgment or 

 



106  decree of any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure by
an Indemnitee to deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly shall not prevent any
Indemnitee from being indemnified hereunder for any Damages, except to the
extent that the failure to so promptly notify the Indemnitor materially
prejudices the Indemnitor.

 

Section 12.06. _Indemnification Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnitee shall give prompt notice in writing to the Indemnitor (or,
in the event the Indemnitor is a Member, to the Member Representative) of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any Third Party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may
be sought pursuant to Section 12.02. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnitee). The
failure to so notify any Indemnitor (or, in the event the Indemnitor is
a Member, the Member Representative) shall not relieve any Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially
prejudiced the Indemnitor.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim, and if the Indemnitor (or, in the event the Indemnitor is
a Member, the Member Representative), elects to do so by giving the Indemnitee
a Control Notice (if permitted to make such election in accordance with the
definition of such term or by Parents prior written consent) within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such Third Party Claim
(and the other information required pursuant to Section 12.06(a)), then,
subject to the other limitations set forth in this Section 12.06, such
Indemnitor shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense (in each case, subject to Section
12.06(d)).

 

(c) If the Indemnitor shall assume the control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 12.06(b)_,
(x) the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if such settlement
does not release the Indemnitee and its Affiliates from all Liabilities with
respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement requires an admission of
fault or imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee
or any of its Affiliates, (y) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose (the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be paid by the Indemnitee unless (A) such Third Party Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief against any Indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates (other than Holdings or its Subsidiaries), (B) the Indemnitee
is named as a defendant in such Third Party Claim, or (C) the Indemnitee
determines with advice of counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnitor or, in the case named as defendants, Holdings or
its Subsidiaries, or that a conflict of interest among any of such parties may
exist in respect of such Third Party Claim, in which case of clauses (A), (B)
or (C), the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnitor)), and (z) the Indemnitor (or, in the event the Indemnitor is a
Member, the Member Representative) shall keep the Indemnitee reasonably
apprised (including by reasonably prompt delivery of copies of all filed
documentation and reasonable consultation rights) of all material events with
respect to such

 



107  Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article 12 or in the AandR Holdings LLC Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 11.07_
shall govern the conduct of any Proceeding with respect to Taxes of an
Acquired Entity or any Subsidiary thereof to the extent provided therein and
the AandR Holdings LLC Agreement shall govern the conduct of any Proceeding if
and to the extent so provided in  _Section_ __ _ 11.07_ or if such
Proceeding is not otherwise addressed by _Section_ __ _ 11.07_.

(d) If the Indemnitor (or in the event the Indemnitor is a Member, the Member
Representative) elects not to assume the defense, settlement, adjustment or
compromise of an asserted Liability, fails to timely and properly notify the
Indemnitee of his, her or its election as herein provided (including the
information required pursuant to Section 12.06) and fails to cure such failure
within five (5) days following written notice to such Indemnitor of such
failure, or, at any time after assuming such defense, fails to diligently
defend against such Third Party Claim in good faith (and fails to cure such
failure within twenty (20) days following written notice to such Indemnitor of
such failure), fails to reasonably demonstrate that such Indemnitee has
access to sufficient resources to pay the amount of any Damages of the
Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim (as required pursuant to
clauses (i)(B) and (ii)(B) respectively of the definition of "Control Notice"
herein) or if the Indemnitee is otherwise entitled pursuant to this Agreement
to have control over the defense, settlement or compromise of such Third Party
Claim, then (i) Holdings shall, in the case of any Third Party Claim arising
out of, relating to, resulting from, in connection with or otherwise in
respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty that is
subject to the Business Cap pursuant to Section 12.03(a), at Holdings
expense, pay, defend, settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim and
such expenses of Holdings shall be included in the calculation of the
Indemnitees Damages (as determined in accordance with Section 12.07(c)) in
the event such inaccuracy and/or breach has occurred, and (ii) in the case of
any other Third Party Claim, Indemnitee may pay, defend, settle, adjust or
compromise such Third Party Claim (subject to the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim) and such
expenses of Indemnitee shall be included in the calculation of the
Indemnitees Damages payable to the Indemnitee hereunder in the event such
inaccuracy, breach and/or other indemnifiable event pursuant Section 12.02 has
occurred. If Holdings has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 12.06(d), then the parties agree that the
defense of such claim by Holdings, including all decisions as to the manner in
which such Third Party Claim is defended, shall be directed by Indemnitee
subject only to (x) the approval of the settlement of such Third Party
Claim by Indemnitor in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of
this Section 12.06(d) and (y) any approval rights with respect to such
settlement pursuant to Section 4.1(g)(i)(C)(III) of the AandR Holdings LLC
Agreement.

 

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. In addition, the
party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall make reasonably
available its employees involved in the defense of such third Party Claims on
a mutually convenient basis (at reasonable regular intervals) for providing
additional information and explanation of any issues, material defense
decisions and/or strategies, and reasonably timely updates on the status of
any such Proceedings.

 



108 Section 12.07. _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(a) No Indemnitee shall be required to mitigate any Damages for which such
Indemnitee seeks indemnification under this Agreement. The amount of any
Damages payable under Section 12.02 shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies or other
Contracts or from any other Person (net of any applicable deductible or
increase in insurance premiums (including retro-premium adjustments);
provided that the Indemnitee shall have no obligation to pursue or continue
the pursuit of any such recovery. If the Indemnitee receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person responsible for any
Damages subsequent to receipt of funds from the Indemnitors, then such
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitors for any funds delivered or
expense incurred by the Indemnitors in connection with the delivery of such
funds up to the amount received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses
(including any increase in insurance premiums (including retro-premium
adjustments)) incurred by such Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in collecting
such amount.

(b) Neither the Members nor Parent shall be liable under Section 12.02 for any
Damages (x) to the extent that there is a specific liability or reserve
relating to such matter that is included (A) in the Group Balance Sheet
(solely in respect of litigation-related, bad debt or customer deposit
reserves made in accordance with GAAP and specifically attributed to the
applicable litigation, account receivable or customer deposit that is the
subject of such indemnification claim under _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_) or
(B) in the calculation of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net
Working Capital, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.14, or (y) to the extent such Damages are otherwise taken into account in
the calculations of the amount of the Final Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the determination of De Minimis
Breaches set forth in Section 12.03, the amount of any Damages incurred by a
Parent Indemnitee arising out of, relating to, resulting from, in connection
with or otherwise in respect of any Damages incurred by Holdings or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed for all purposes herein, to the extent that any
Parent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in accordance with this
Article 12, to be the proportionate amount of such Damages sustained by any
Acquired Entities or any of their Subsidiaries (i.e., based on Parents
Percentage Share (as defined in the AandR Holdings LLC Agreement)) as of
immediately following the consummation of the Closing.

Section 12.08.  _Member Representative_. With respect to the matters for
which the Members are obligated to provide or are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)_ or _12.02(b)_ , notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Member Representative shall
make or receive all notices, waivers and consents applicable to the Members on
behalf thereof and Parent shall be obligated only to provide written notice to
the Member Representative (who shall be deemed the "Indemnitor" or
"Indemnitee", as the case may be, which respect to all notices, waivers and
consents applicable to the Member under _Article_ __ _ 12_).

 



109 Section 12.09. _Treatment of Adjustments_. Unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, any amount paid by the Members or Parent under Section 12.02
will be treated as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file

amendment, by Parent and the Member Representative (subject to (x) clause (i)
of _Section_ __ _ 14.14(a)_, and (y) with respect to Section 9.11 or Section
2.03(b)(iv) or any addition to the scope of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements provided by The Madison Square Garden Company or the
Earn-Out Guarantor respectively under this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement, the written consent of The Madison Square Garden Company or the
Earn-Out Guarantor, as applicable) or, in the case of a waiver, by Parent (in
the case of any waiver against Parent or Parent Merger Sub) or by the Member
Representative (in the case of any waiver against any Management Seller,
Rollover Holdco, other Rollover Holdco Member, Direct Rollover Member or
Acquired Entity (subject to clause (i) of _Section_ __ _ 14.14(a)_).

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 14.03. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ , that (x) the Transaction
Expenses of each Acquired Entity shall

 



111  be borne by the Members pursuant to the deduction thereof in the definitions
of "Cash Purchase Price", or if not paid in connection with the Closing or
pursuant to Section 2.12, to be paid in accordance with Article 12; and (y)
the Debt Financing Expenses shall be borne entirely by Holdings, and promptly
after the consummation of the Closing, Holdings shall reimburse Parent and the
Management Sellers, Direct Rollover Members and other Rollover Holdco Members
and their respective Affiliates in respect of any Debt Financing Expenses
incurred by them.

 

Section 14.04. _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties that are contained in this Agreement, but only
if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties is readily apparent on the
face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to be
material or have a Group Material Adverse Effect.

Section 14.05.  _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto, the respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties
hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 14.02(a)_ and the proviso to
_Section_ __ _ 14.02(a)_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons identified therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
indemnified Persons (in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.06)_ shall be third
party beneficiaries to the covenants and obligations set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.06;_ and (ii) the Members, Management Sellers and their Affiliates,
and Members Counsel (including their partners and employees) shall be third
party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 14.13_. Any assignment in violation of
this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement (including any rights with respect to all or
any portion of an Earn-Out Amount) without the consent of each other party
hereto, provided that (i) Parent and Parent Merger Sub may assign any or all
of their respective rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more
wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of The Madison Square
Garden Company (provided that such assignment shall not relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder) and (ii) each Member may assign any or all of his, her
or its respective rights with respect to all or any portion of the Earn-Out
Amounts due and payable to such Member (A) with respect to any Member that is
an individual: (1) to a trust solely for the benefit of such individual or the
members of such individuals immediate family with such individual acting as
trustee of such trust and retaining control thereunder for so long as such
individual is physically able; or (2) to an entity that is owned solely by
such individual and the members of such individuals

 



112  immediate family with such individual retaining authority to appoint all of
the directors (or persons serving in a similar capacity) for so long as such
individual is physically able or (B) to any wholly-owned Affiliate.

Section 14.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 14.07.  _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates, but excluding matters determined
by the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ or _Section_ __ _
2.14_) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 14.01_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

Section 14.08. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

Section 14.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

Section 14.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreement embody the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to
the transactions and merges in, supersedes and cancels all prior written or
oral commitments, arrangements or understandings with respect thereto.

 



113 Section 14.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 14.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that there is adequate remedy at law. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Section 14.13. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing
that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Stern Tannenbaum and Bell
LLP, Andrews Kurth Kenyon LLP, Jackson Lewis P.C., Grubman Shire and Meiselas,
P.C. and Fishman and Decea, LLP (" _Members_ __ _Counsel_ ") have acted as
legal counsel to the Members, the Management Sellers, the Acquired Entities
and their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Members
Counsel may act as legal counsel to the Members, the Management Sellers
and/or their Affiliates after the Closing, (i) each of Parent and each
Acquired Entity hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
respective Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with any of Members Counsel representing the Members, the Management Sellers
and/or their Affiliates after the Closing relating to Members Counsels
representation prior to the Closing, and (ii) each of Parent, each Acquired
Entity and each of their respective Subsidiaries hereby agrees that, in the
event that a dispute arises between or among any of Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, each Acquired Entity and
each of their respective Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Member,
Management Seller and/or their Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing,
each Acquired Entity and each of their respective Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, each of the parties hereto agree that any of Members Counsel
may, to the extent permitted by applicable ethics rules, represent any Member,
Management Seller and/or their Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Member, Management Seller and/or such Affiliate may be
directly adverse to Parent, an Acquired Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates at that time (including, after the Closing, each Acquired Entity
and each of their respective Subsidiaries), and even though Members Counsel
may have represented the Acquired Entities and their respective Subsidiaries
in a matter

 



114  substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters
for the Members, Management Sellers and/or their Affiliates, Parent and each
Acquired Entity hereby waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their
respective Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such
representation by any of Members Counsel relating to Members Counsels
representation prior to the Closing. Parent further agrees that, as to all
communications among any of Members Counsel, the Acquired Entities and their
respective Subsidiaries that directly and specifically relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege,
the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege, belong solely to the Member Representative in any dispute with
Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, each Acquired Entity
and each of their respective Subsidiaries) and shall be solely controlled by
the Member Representative in any dispute with Parent or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, each Acquired Entity and each of their
respective Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises
after the Closing between Parent or any Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and
a third party other than (and unaffiliated with) the Members, Management
Sellers and their Affiliates, on the other hand, then Parent or Affiliate (to
the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such third party of confidential communications by a Members
Counsel, and, in relation to such dispute, no Member, Management Seller,
or Affiliate of either shall be permitted to waive its attorney-client
privilege with respect to such confidential communications without Parents
prior written consent. The parties hereto agree to take, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the intent of
this _Section_ __ _ 14.13_. Parent acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, each Acquired Entity and each of
their respective Subsidiaries), that each has had the opportunity to discuss
and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks
of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and
other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than a Members Counsel. This _Section_ __ _ 14.13_ is for the
benefit of the Members, Management Sellers and their Affiliates, and Members
Counsel (including their partners and employees), each of which are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 14.13_.

 

Section 14.14. _Member Representative_.

 

(a) Pursuant to the Deal Approval, and in any event upon the delivery (whether
prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise) of an executed Letter of
Transmittal to Parent in accordance with this Agreement and without any
further action on the part of any Member, each Member shall thereby, and each
Management Seller or other Rollover Holdco Member and, solely with respect
to the period prior to the consummation of the Closing, Rollover Holdco and
each Acquired Entity does hereby, irrevocably appoint the Member
Representative as the sole representative of such Member, Management Seller or
other Rollover Holdco Member or, solely with respect to the period prior to
the consummation of the Closing, Rollover Holdco and each Acquired Entity as
the case may be (each, a " _Represented Party_ "), to act as the agent and on
behalf of such Represented Party regarding any matter relating to or under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the Letters of
Transmittal (the " _Represented Documents_ ") including for the purposes of
(i) executing and delivering the Represented Documents (it being understood
that no amendment thereto shall be made that by Law requires further approval
by such Represented Party without such further

 



115  approval), and taking all actions required or permitted to be taken under
such Represented Documents, (ii) on behalf of the Members, (x) directing the
Escrow Agent to make payment of the Escrow Funds in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.14_, _Article_ __ _ 12_ and the Escrow Agreement, (y) agreeing to,
negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of and complying with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to _Section_ __ _
2.14_, _Article_ __ _ 12_ and the Escrow Agreement and (z) acting for the
Members with regard to all matters pertaining to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.14_, _Article_ __ _ 12_ and the Escrow Agreement, including
the power to compromise any claim on behalf of the Members thereunder and to
transact matters of litigation or other claims and to bring any Proceeding on
behalf of the Members under Section 2.03(b)(iv), _Article_ __ _ 12_, Section
9.11 or Section 14.05, (iii) giving, receiving and forwarding all notices and
communications required to be given or received by the Represented Parties
under the Represented Documents and in connection with any of the
Transactions, including receiving service of process in connection with any
claims thereunder, (iv) engaging attorneys, accountants, financial and other
advisors, paying agents and other Persons necessary or appropriate, in the
sole discretion of the Member Representative in the performance of its duties
under the Represented Documents, and authorizing and directing the
disbursement of funds to pay the fees and expenses of such Persons (v)
granting any consent, approval or waiver on behalf of the Members, the
Management Sellers or other Rollover Holdco Member or, prior to the Closing,
the Acquired Entities under this Agreement prior to, at and following the
Closing (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.02_); and (vi) taking all
actions or refraining from doing any further act or deed on its own behalf or
on behalf of any Represented Party that the Member Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in its discretion relating to the subject matter of
the Represented Documents, as fully and completely as the Represented Parties
could do if personally present. All decisions and actions by the Member
Representative are binding upon all Represented Parties, and no Represented
Party shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same. As the representative of the Represented Parties under this
Agreement, the Member Representative shall act as the agent for all
Represented Parties, shall have authority to bind each such Represented Party
in accordance with this Agreement, and Parent may rely on such appointment and
authority until the receipt of notice of the appointment of a successor in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 14.14(d)_. Parent may conclusively rely upon,
without independent verification or investigation, all decisions made by the
Member Representative in connection with the Represented Documents in
writing.

(b) The Member Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to
incur such costs as the Member Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, and the Member Representative shall be reimbursed by the Members
for all such fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses and any fees and costs of the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section
2.09 or _Section_ __ _ 2.14_). In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall
deposit the Expense Holdback Amount with the Member Representative in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.10(d)(v)_ in order for the Member
Representative to pay any such fees and expenses. As soon as practicable
following the completion of all procedures described under _Section_ __ _
2.14_, _Section_ __ _ 12.01_ and the Escrow Agreement, the Member
Representative shall deliver the balance of the Expense Holdback Amount (if
any) to the Holdings Pre-Closing Members (in proportion to the amount the
Closing Merger Consideration payable to such Holdings Pre-Closing Member
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_ was reduced by such Expense Holdback
Amount).

 



116 (c) The Member Representative (in its capacity as such) shall not be liable to
any Represented Party, Parent, Parent Merger Sub or any other person in the
absence of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Members shall,
severally (pro rata in accordance with each Members Holdings Allocation
Percentage), but not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Member
Representative and its successors and assigns from and against any and all
Damages arising as a result of or incurred in connection with any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by the Member Representative, in each case as
such Damages are incurred or suffered; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event it is finally adjudicated that such Damages or any portion thereof were
primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Member
Representative, the Member Representative will reimburse the Members the
amount of such indemnified Damages attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Member Representative by the
Members, any such Damages may be recovered by the Member Representative from
amounts released from the Escrow Funds to the Members after the Expiration
Date in accordance with Section 2.15 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and/or the Expense Holdback Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that this does
not relieve the Members from their obligation to promptly pay such Damages as
such Damages are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Member
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at Law or otherwise.

(d) All of the immunities granted to the Member Representative under this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement.
The grant of authority provided for herein is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any of the Represented Parties, but shall terminate with
respect to the Acquired Entities upon the consummation of the Closing.

(e) The Member Representative may be changed from time to time upon written
notice from the Members to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Member
Representative may not be removed unless Members representing a greater than
fifty percent (50%) Holdings Allocation Percentage agree in writing to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted Member Representative and such
substituted Member the substitution is reasonably acceptable to Parent. Upon
any resignation of the Member Representative, or any other vacancy in the
position of the Member Representative, such vacancy may be filled by such a
majority.

 

Section 14.15. _Releases_.

 

(a) Each Principal, Rollover Holdco Member, Direct Rollover Member and each
other Equityholder (together with the Principals, Rollover Holdco Members and
Direct Rollover Members, the " _Member_ _Releasor_ ") hereby agrees that, in
consideration of benefits he, she or it will receive in connection with the
Transactions, effective upon the consummation of the Closing, he, she or it
knowingly and voluntarily irrevocably releases and forever discharges (i) the
Acquired Entities (ii) the respective Subsidiaries of the Acquired Entities,
(iii) Rollover Holdco, and (iv) the respective managers, officers, agents and
representatives of the Acquired Entities, their respective Subsidiaries and
Rollover Holdco (collectively clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the "
_Acquired Entity Released Parties_ ") from any and all claims, controversies,
actions, causes of action, cross-claims, counter-claims, rights, demands,
debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary
damages, other damages, claims for costs or attorneys fees, or Liabilities of
any nature whatsoever in law, equity or otherwise, and whether

 



117  known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, or claimed or unclaimed (and
including without limitation for or on account of fraud), against any of the
Acquired Entity Released Parties that the Member Releasor or any of his, her
or its successors or assigns has ever had, may now have or hereafter can,
shall or may have to any extent relating in any way to or in connection with
any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to and
including the consummation of the Closing (subject to the proviso below, all
of the foregoing collectively referred to herein as the " _Member Released
Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release shall not
include, and no release or discharge is given hereunder in respect of any
obligations required to be performed or amounts due or owed by any Acquired
Entity Released Party (x) under this Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement
and/or any other Transaction Document after the Closing Date (including
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.06_) (provided that the exception in this clause
(x) shall not apply to Rollover Holdco and its managers, officers, agents
and representatives with respect to each Equityholder that is not a
Principal, Rollover Holdco Member or Direct Rollover Member), (y) with respect
to employees of the Acquired Entities or Subsidiaries of the Acquired
Entities, earned but unpaid Ordinary Course salary and bonuses or
reimbursement of expenses in the Ordinary Course to the extent not past due as
of the Closing Date, or (z) with respect to any obligations included in the
calculation of the Balance Sheet Adjustment or Transaction Expenses as
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.14_. For the avoidance of
doubt, except for the Affiliate Contracts and Affiliate Transactions listed on
_Schedule_ __ _ 14.15_ of the Disclosure Schedule, this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, each of the Affiliate Contracts and Affiliate
Transactions are hereby terminated as of the consummation of the Closing and
none of the Affiliate Contracts or Affiliate Transactions shall have any
further force or effect, notwithstanding any survival or other provision
contained therein to the contrary or any past practice.

 

(b) Each of the Acquired Entities (for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
14.15(b)_, the " _Acquired Entity Releasor_ " and with the Member Releasor,
each a " _Releasor_ " and together the " _Releasors_ ") hereby agrees that, in
consideration of benefits it will receive in connection with the Transactions,
effective upon the consummation of the Closing, it knowingly and voluntarily
irrevocably releases and forever discharges the Principals, and solely as to
their capacity as a Member or holder of Equity Interests in any of the
Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries, the Equityholders (together with the
Principals, the " _Member Released Parties_ " and the Member Released Parties
together with the Acquired Entity Released Parties, the " _Released Parties_
") from any and all claims, controversies, actions, causes of action, cross-
claims, counter-claims, rights, demands, debts, compensatory damages,
liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for
costs or attorneys fees, or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law,
equity or otherwise, and whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
or claimed or unclaimed against any of the Principals that each Acquired
Entity Releasor or any of its successors or assigns has ever had, may now
have or hereafter can, shall or may have to any extent relating in any way to
or in connection with any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning
of the world to and including the consummation of the Closing (subject to the
proviso below, all of the foregoing collectively referred to herein as the "
_Acquired Entity Released Claims_ " and together with the Member Released
Claims, the " _Released Claims_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing release shall not include, and no release or discharge is given
hereunder in respect of any obligations required to be performed or amounts
due or owed by any Acquired Entity Released Party (i) under this Agreement
and/or any other

 



118  Transaction Document, (ii) with respect to any Member Released Party other
than a Principal, to the extent not relating to such Member Released Partys
capacity as a Member or holder of Equity Interests, or (iii) with respect to
any claim for fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, except for the Affiliate
Contracts and Affiliate Transactions listed on Schedule 14.15 of the
Disclosure Schedule, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, each
of the Affiliate Contracts and Affiliate Transactions are hereby terminated as
of the consummation of the Closing and none of the Affiliate Contracts or
Affiliate Transactions shall have any further force or
effect, notwithstanding any survival or other provision contained therein to
the contrary or any past practice.

(c) Each Releasor acknowledges and intends that the releases given in this
_Section_ __ _ 14.15_ shall be effective as a bar to each and every one of
the Released Claims herein above mentioned or implied. Each Releasor expressly
consents that the releases given in this _Section_ __ _ 14.15_ shall be
given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and
provisions, including those relating to unknown and unsuspected Released
Claims (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the
effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected or unanticipated
Released Claims), if any, as well as those relating to any other Released
Claims herein above mentioned or implied. Each Releasor expressly waives and
relinquishes all rights and benefits he, she or it may have under Section 1542
of the California Civil Code, which reads as follows:

 

"SECTION 1542. CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY GENERAL RELEASE. A GENERAL
RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT
TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF
KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH
THE DEBTOR."

 

(d) Each Releasor acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an essential and
material term of the release given in this  _Section_ __ _ 14.15_ and that
without such waiver Parent would not enter into this Agreement or consummate
the Transactions. Each Releasor further agrees that in the event it should
assert any claim seeking damages against any of the Released Parties, the
release given in this _Section_ __ _ 14.15_ shall serve as a complete defense
to any such Released Claim. Other than with respect to the Releasors rights
that arise from claims that are excluded pursuant to the proviso set forth in
clause (a) of this Section, each Releasor further agrees that there does not
exist any claim of the type described in or implied by clause (a) hereof and
it is not aware of any pending or threatened claims of the type described in
or implied by clause (a) hereof.

(e) Each Releasor agrees that neither the releases given in this  _Section_
__ _ 14.15_, nor the furnishing of the consideration for the releases given
in this _Section_ __ _ 14.15_, shall be deemed or construed at any time to be
an admission by any Released Party or the Releasor of any improper or
unlawful conduct.

(f) Each Releasor acknowledges and agrees that such Releasor may hereafter
discover facts different from or in addition to those now known, or believed
to be true, regarding the subject matter of the releases given in this
_Section_ __ _ 14.15_ and further acknowledges and agrees that the releases
given in this  _Section_ __ _ 14.15_ shall remain in full force and effect,
notwithstanding the existence of any different or additional facts.
