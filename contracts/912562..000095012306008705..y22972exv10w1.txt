Closing Working Capital Adjustment"), after the Closing as follows:   (a)
within forty-five (45) days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller a closing balance sheet of the Business (the "Closing
Date Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and in a manner consistent with the

Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the footnotes thereto,
which shall include, without limitation, all Assumed Liabilities.   (b) the
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be deemed to be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Seller to
notify Purchaser of a dispute within forty-five (45) days after receiving the
Closing Date Balance Sheet; (ii) the resolution of all disputes by the Seller
and Purchaser; or (iii) the resolution of all disputes by the Independent
Accounting Firm. Within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date
Balance Sheet is deemed to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, a
cash adjustment shall be   6   made as follows: in the event that the Net
Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than
$15,334,000 (the amount of such difference being the "Seller Working Capital
Adjustment"), then the Seller shall pay the Purchaser the amount of the
Seller Working Capital Adjustment together with interest thereon as
determined below in immediately available funds by certified or official bank
check or by wire transfer to an account specified by Purchaser and, in the
event that the Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet is greater than $15,834,000 (the amount of such difference being the
"Purchaser Working Capital Adjustment"), then the Purchaser shall pay to the
Seller the amount of the Purchaser Working Capital Adjustment together with
interest thereon as provided below in immediately available funds by
certified or official bank check or by wire transfer to an account
specified by the Seller. The amount payable by Seller to Purchaser or by
Purchaser to Seller as determined by the preceding provisions of this Section
2.06(b) shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date that any such
payment is made at an annual rate equal to six percent (6%). Schedule 2.06(b)
hereto sets forth certain accounts receivable which shall be excluded from
current assets on the Closing Date Balance Sheet when determining Net Working
Capital.   (c) Seller may dispute the amounts reflected on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet by delivering written notice (a "Closing Date Dispute
Notice") to Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after receiving the initial
Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Closing Date Dispute Notice shall identify
each disputed item on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, specify the amount of
such dispute and set forth the general basis for each item in dispute. In the
event of such a dispute, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
items shall be final, binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach a resolution of their differences
within twenty (20) days after the date the Seller delivers the Closing Date
Dispute Notice to Purchaser, then Seller and Purchaser shall promptly submit
any remaining disputed items to any independent accounting firm of
international reputation mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (an
"Independent Accounting Firm"). If any remaining disputed items are submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution (i) each party will furnish
to the Independent Accounting Firm such workpapers and other documents and
information relating to the remaining disputed items as the Independent
Accounting Firm may request and are available to such party, and each party
will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting
Firm any material relating to the disputed items and to discuss
the resolution of the disputed items with the Independent Accounting Firm;
(ii) each party will use its good faith best efforts to work with the other
parties and the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve the disputed items
within forty-five (45) days of submission of the disputed items to the
Independent Accounting Firm; (iii) the determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm, as set forth in a written notice to Seller and Purchaser
setting forth the reasons underlying such determination, shall be final,
binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser; and (iv) the fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between
Seller and Purchaser so that Seller pays for the percentage of such fees and
disbursements equal to the ratio that the amount of the disputed items
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed
by Seller (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to
the total amount of all disputed items submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm, and Purchaser shall pay the balance of such fees and
disbursements.   7    SECTION 2.07 Payment for Nemak Project Payments.
(a) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a statement setting forth in reasonable detail (the "Nemak Project
Payments Statement"), the total amount paid by the Seller (including, but not
limited to, checks issued by Seller which have not yet cleared) during the
period beginning March 20, 2006 and ending on the Closing Date for work,
labor and services performed for the Seller and products, goods, materials
and equipment purchased by Seller in connection with the implementation by
Seller of the Nemak Project (such amount being hereinafter the "Nemak Project
Payments"). The Purchaser agrees that, in addition to the Purchase Price, the
Purchaser shall, subject to the following provisions of this Section 2.07,
pay an amount equal to the Nemak Project Payments to the Seller no later than
three (3) Business Days after the amount of the Nemak Project Payments are
deemed to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties as provided for in
Section 2.07(b) below.   (b) The amount of the Nemak Project Payments shall
be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties upon the
earliest of: (i) the failure of Purchaser to notify Seller of a dispute with
respect to the amount of the Nemak Project Payments within thirty (30) days
after receiving the Nemak Project Payments Statement; (ii) the resolution of
all disputes by the Seller and Purchaser with respect to the amount of the
Nemak Project Payments; or (iii) the resolution of all disputes with respect
to the amount of the Nemak Project Payments by the Independent Accounting
Firm.   (c) Purchaser may dispute the amount of the Nemak Project
Payments reflected in the Nemak Project Payments Statement by delivering
written notice (a "Nemak Payments Dispute Notice") to Seller within thirty
(30) days after receiving the Nemak Project Payments Statement from the
Seller. The Nemak Payments Dispute Notice shall specify the amount of such
dispute and set forth the general basis for each item in dispute. In the
event of such a dispute, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
items shall be final, binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach a resolution of their differences
within twenty (20) days after the date the Purchaser delivers the Nemak
Payments Dispute Notice to Seller, then Seller and Purchaser shall promptly
submit the dispute as to the amount of the Nemak Project Payments to the
Independent Accounting Firm. Upon submission of the dispute with respect to
the amount of the Nemak Project Payments to the Independent Accounting Firm,
the timing and process for the resolution of such dispute (including the
responsibilities of the parties in the context of such proceeding and the
allocation of the fees of the Independent Accounting Firm) shall be the same
as the timing and process set forth in Section 2.06(c) for the resolution of
disputes with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet.   SECTION 2.08
Consent of Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an
attempt by Seller to assign to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement any
Contract, Permit, franchise, claim or asset included in the Assets that is by
its terms or by Law non-assignable without the consent of any other party or
parties, unless such consent or approval shall have been given, or as to
which all the remedies for the enforcement thereof available to Seller would
not by Law pass to Purchaser as an incident of the assignments provided for
by this Agreement (a "Non-Assignable Contract"). To the extent that
any consent in respect of, or a   8   novation of, a Non-Assignable
Contract shall not have been obtained on or before the Closing Date, Seller
shall continue to use reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent or
novation after the Closing Date until such time as it shall have been
obtained or the requirement to obtain such consent or novation shall
have been waived by Purchaser, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in
any economically feasible arrangement to provide that Purchaser shall receive
the interest of Seller in the benefits under such Non-Assignable Contract,
including performance by Seller as agent if economically feasible, provided
that Purchaser shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding
Liabilities arising after the Closing Date under the terms of any such Non-
Assignable Contract solely to the extent that Purchaser would have been
responsible therefor if such consent or approval had been obtained.  
SECTION 2.09 Assignment of all Intellectual Property of Seller. The Seller
hereby agrees that all of the Intellectual Property owned by the Seller or
with respect to which Seller has an interest which is now or has

limitation of the foregoing, on the Closing Date and as a condition to the
obligations of the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the Seller shall enter into
an agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule 2.04(d)(i)
(wherein the Seller shall assign and transfer to the Purchaser all such
Intellectual Property (a "Seller IP Assignment").   SECTION 2.10 Transfer

customs, duties, fees, transfer or other Taxes (other than sales taxes)
assessed in connection with the transfer of the Assets. For purposes of
determining such transfer taxes the fair market value of each of the Assets
shall be deemed to be equal to the value allocated to such Assets in Schedule
2.12. Further, such transfer taxes shall be paid in accordance
with applicable Law, whether based on the fair market value of the relevant
Assets, the value of such Assets contained in the Balance Sheet or any other
value provided by Law. Purchaser shall pay any sales taxes imposed on the
sale of the Assets and all recording fees relating to the filing of any
instruments or assignments by which the Seller conveys the Owned Real
Property or other Assets and any assignment of any Intellectual Property to
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.   (b) The following
apportionments shall be made between the parties at the Closing as of the
close of the business day prior to the Closing Date: real estate taxes,
personal property taxes assessed on an annual basis, rent, water charges and
sewer rents, if any, on the basis of the fiscal period for which assessed. If
the Closing shall occur before a new tax rate is fixed, the apportionment of
taxes shall be upon the basis of the old tax rate for the preceding period
applied to the latest valuation. Promptly, after the new tax rate is fixed,
the apportionment of taxes shall be recomputed and any discrepancy resulting
from such recomputation shall be promptly corrected, which obligations shall
survive Closing. If there is a water meter upon the Premises, Seller shall
cause a final reading to be made within three business days of the date of
Closing. This provision shall survive the Closing.   (c) The Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly file an election pursuant to Section 167 of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada) exempting the sale of Assets from the goods and
services Tax and, exempting qualified Assets from the Province of Ontario
retail sales tax.   9    SECTION 2.11 Power of Attorney. The Seller
hereby irrevocably grants Purchaser and its successors full power and

SECTION 2.13 Accounting. All accounting determinations required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement (including determinations of the Post

with GAAP applied consistently with the past practices of the Seller,
provided, however, that it is understood and agreed that it shall not be a
breach of this section if the Closing Date Balance Sheet does not include any
cash or cash equivalents as contemplated by Section 2.01(b)(i).   SECTION
2.14 Purchaser\'s Title and Survey Expenses. Fifty percent (50%) of the
reasonable expenses of the Purchaser in surveying and examining title to the

the Leased Real Property, there are no facts that would prevent the Leased
Real Property from being occupied by the Purchaser after the Closing in the
same manner as occupied by the Seller immediately prior to the Closing. The
Seller shall   18   not enter into any agreement affecting use and/or
occupancy of the Leased Real Property which would be binding upon or
otherwise adversely affect Purchaser after Closing. All sums due to the

information with respect to the Purchaser and the Business. In the event any
Person is requested or required (by oral or written request for information
or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process or by Law) to disclose any such
confidential information, then Gibraltar shall notify Purchaser promptly of
the request or requirement so that Purchaser, at its expense, may seek an
appropriate protective order (with the reasonable assistance of Gibraltar) or
waive compliance with this Section 5.04. If, in the absence of a protective
order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, any such Person is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose such confidential information such Person may
so disclose the confidential information. The provisions of this Section 5.04
shall not be deemed to prohibit the disclosure of confidential information
relating to the operations or affairs of the Business by the Seller to the
extent reasonably required (i) to prepare or complete any required Tax
Returns or financial statements, (ii) in connection with audits or other
proceedings by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority, (iii) in connection
with any insurance or claims to any insurer or any Person acting as an
insurer, or (iv) to provide services to Purchaser or an Affiliate in
accordance with the terms and conditions of any of the Ancillary
Agreements.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Section 5.04 shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a disclosure by Gibraltar or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) is or becomes available to Gibraltar or any of its
subsidiaries after the Closing on a non-confidential basis from a source that
is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation or (iii) is or has been independently developed by
Gibraltar or any of its subsidiaries (other than primarily for the Business)
without access to the information described in Section 5.04(a).   (c) Each
of the parties agrees and acknowledges that remedies at law for any breach of
their obligations under this Section 5.04 are inadequate and each party shall
be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, in the event of or to preclude any such breach.  
SECTION 5.05 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents. (a) Each of the
parties hereto shall obtain all authorizations, consents, orders,
and approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or
become necessary for such parties\' execution and delivery of, and the
performance of their respective obligations pursuant to, this Agreement
and   32   each Ancillary Agreement, and will cooperate fully with each
other in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals.   (b) Each of the parties hereto shall (i) give promptly
such notices to third parties, and (ii) use its best efforts to obtain such
third party consents, each to the extent necessary or useful in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to assist each
other in giving such notices and obtaining such consents; provided, however,
that no party hereto shall have any obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice or consent or
to consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement which
such party in its sole and absolute discretion may deem adverse to the
interests of the Purchaser, the Seller, the Assets or the Business; provided
further, however, that in the event a consent is not obtained by the Seller
the parties shall negotiate in good faith a reduction in the Purchase Price
equal to the Purchaser\'s reasonable cost of obtaining the benefit of the
asset for which such consent is necessary.   SECTION 5.06 Non-Competition.
(a) From the date of this Agreement through the sixth anniversary of the
Closing (the "Noncompetition Period"), the Sellers and their Affiliates agree
not to, whether individually or in their capacity as a director, officer,
manager, member, partner, shareholder, agent or representative of or to a
Person or entity (other than the Purchaser) or otherwise, directly or
indirectly:   (i) engage in a "Competitive Business", which for the 
purpose of this Agreement, means a business located in or transacting 
business in North America that is competitive with the Business; or   (ii)
either (A) solicit for a Competitive Business or  endeavor to entice away,
any Person or entity who is a current customer  of the Business as of the
date hereof and during the Noncompetition  Period or who has been a customer
of the Business within the past  twelve (12) months or at any time during the
term of this Agreement to  use any products or services offered by a
Competitive Business; (B)  perform any action, activity or course of conduct
which is detrimental  in any material respect to the Business or business
reputation of the  Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), including, without

of  its Affiliates), and/or (2) encouraging any employee of the Purchaser 
(or any of its Affiliates) to leave the employment of the same; or (C) 
assist any Person or entity in any way to do, or attempt to do,  anything
prohibited by Section 5.06(a)(i) or this Section 5.06(a)(ii)  (except for
responding to requests for reference checks).   (b) The Seller acknowledges
that a material breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 5.06
would result in material irreparable injury to the Purchaser for which there
is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages
for such injuries precisely and that the Purchaser will be entitled to obtain
a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the Seller from engaging in   33    activities prohibited
by this Section 5.06, and such other relief as may be required to
specifically enforce any of the covenants in this Section 5.06.   (c) The
Purchaser and the Seller agree and acknowledge that the provisions of this
Section 5.06 constitute an integral part of the purchase of the Business and
the Assets from the Seller by the Purchaser, and that without such provisions
the Purchaser would be unwilling to proceed with the purchase of the Business
and the Assets and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Section
5.06 shall be enforceable irrespective of the terms of any other agreements
that may be entered into among the Purchaser (or their successors or
Affiliates) and the Seller. If any provision or portion of this Section 5.06
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,
any such invalid or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be
deemed, without further action on the part of the parties hereto, modified,
amended or limited to the extent necessary to render the same valid and
enforceable.   (d) Nothing in this Section 5.06 shall preclude or
prohibit Gibraltar or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring the stock or
assets of any Person which derives (both at the time of acquisition and at
all times thereafter) less than (i) five (5%) of its revenues and (ii) less
than $20 million per annum from the conduct of a Competitive Business;
provided, however, that if such Person exceeds the limits set forth in items
(i) or (ii) of this subsection at any time, then Gibraltar shall divest
itself of such business and, in connection with such divestiture, shall first
offer such business for sale to Purchaser at a price and on terms and
conditions to be agreed.   SECTION 5.07 Further Action. Each of the parties
hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, each as may be required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.   SECTION 5.08 Name Change. Simultaneous with the

Heat Treating, Inc.", "Harbor Metal Treating Co.", "Harbor Metal Treating of
Indiana, Inc.", "Hi-Temp Heat Treating, Inc." and "Pennsylvania Industrial
Heat Treaters, Inc." to different names not similar or confusing with such
names, and shall execute and deliver any documents necessary or desirable to
permit the Purchaser to continue their use of their existing corporate and
trade names.   SECTION 5.09 No-Shop Covenant. (a) The Seller covenants
and agrees that until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date and the
Termination Date, the Purchaser shall be, and is hereby, granted the
exclusive right to (i) hold discussions and negotiations with the Seller with

related thereto, with respect to the proposed acquisition by the Purchaser of

indebtedness or other obligations with respect to the Assets in order to
render the Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances, and at Closing the
Seller shall deliver evidence of the foregoing satisfactory to the
Purchaser.   SECTION 5.11 Satisfaction of Excluded Liabilities. The
Seller hereby agrees that (a) all Excluded Liabilities, including, without
limitation, the Accrued Bonuses, shall remain the sole and exclusive

SECTION 5.13 Employees. The Seller shall be solely responsible for offering
and providing any continuation coverage required under Section 4980B of the
Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA Coverage") with respect to any

a "qualifying event" at or prior to the Closing. The Purchaser shall make
offers of employment to all current employees of the Seller engaged primarily
in the conduct of the Business, (including any employees on family leave),
other than those employees that are not active full time employees of the
Business or who are on long term disability leave, which offers of employment
shall provide for compensation and benefits which are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits currently
provided by the Seller to such employees and those employees who accept such
offers of employment shall, for purposes of this Agreement be referred to as
"Transferred Employees". For the purposes hereof, the term "full time" shall
mean working a minimum of thirty five (35) hours per week for each week
during the preceding three (3) month period. The Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for offering and providing any COBRA Coverage required with
respect to any Transferred   35    Employee (or other qualified

in Section 4980B of the Code.   SECTION 5.14 Change of Lockbox Accounts.
Immediately after the Closing, the Seller shall cause Purchaser to be

agree that all attorney-client, work product and other legal privileges that
may exist with respect to the Assets and the Business shall, from and after
the Closing Date, be deemed joint privileges of the Seller and the Purchaser.
Both the Seller and the Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts after the Closing Date to preserve all privileges and neither the

necessary to comply with the HSR Act and to obtain early termination of any
waiting period pursuant thereto.   SECTION 5.18 Insurance. To the extent
that the Seller maintains per occurrence based insurance policies, the
Purchaser shall retain the benefits of such policies with respect to claims
which result from pre-closing events, acts or omissions. The Seller hereby
agrees to indemnify Carl Spezio for acts taken prior to the Closing Date, to
the same extent that Mr. Spezio would have been indemnified by a Seller under
any applicable Seller\'s Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, Operating
Agreement or other similar organizational documents.   SECTION 5.19
Schedules. Seller reserves the right to update the Schedules attached hereto
between the date hereof and the Closing with respect to matters arising
during such period, provided, however, that no such update shall diminish the
liabilities of Seller under this Agreement or materially reduce the scope of,
or increase the exceptions to, the representations and warranties set forth
herein. Further, any such update will be disregarded, and interpreted as if
such update had never been made, when determining whether the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 6.02 have been satisfied.   36     ARTICLE

is permitted to contribute under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Losses incurred by the Purchaser. The Seller shall
have no liability under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph unless
and until the aggregate of all Purchaser Losses exceed $1,000,000, in which
event Seller shall be liable for all Purchaser Losses to the extent that such
Purchaser Losses exceed $1,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller\'s obligation to indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against Purchaser Losses shall be (i) unlimited with
respect to Taxes, fraud, breaches of Sections 3.01, 3.15(b) and 3.22(b) and
the known environmental matters listed on Schedule 7.02(a), and (ii) for all
other matters, limited to $13,500,000.00.   (b) Indemnification of Seller.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VII, the Seller and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(for purposes of the Article VII, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser, for the amount of any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, awards, judgments
and penalties actually suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party
(including, without limitation, any Action brought or otherwise initiated by
such Seller) (hereinafter a "Seller Loss"), arising out of or resulting from
any misrepresentation or breach of representation or covenant made or to
be performed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have no
liability under this Section (b) unless and until the aggregate of all  
40    Seller Losses exceeds $1,000,000, in which event the Purchaser shall
be liable for all Seller Losses to the extent that such Seller Losses exceed
$1,000,000. To the extent that the Purchaser\'s undertakings set forth in
this Section 7.02 may be unenforceable, the Purchaser shall, collectively,
contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted to contribute under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Losses incurred by the
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser\'s obligation to
indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against Seller
Losses shall be limited to and shall not, in the aggregate, exceed
$13,500,000.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations contained in
this Section 7.02(b) shall not be applicable to any failure by Purchaser to
pay all or any portion of the Purchase Price when due or to any Seller Losses
resulting from any breach of the lease between BandW; Leasing. LLC and Corvus
Nodular Interests II, LLC (for the lease of the premises occupied by BandW; of
Michigan, Inc., located in Saginaw, Michigan) ) (the "Saginaw Lease") by the
Purchaser or its successors or assigns. Further, Purchaser covenants
and agrees that, for so long as Seller or any of its Affiliates has a
guaranty obligation outstanding with respect to the Saginaw Lease, neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates will assign the Saginaw Lease to any Person
unless such Person assumes the indemnity obligation of Purchaser relating
thereto.   (c) Notice of Claims. Any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party (hereinafter an "Indemnified Party") that
suffers, respectively, a Purchaser Loss or a Seller Loss (hereinafter a
"Loss") shall give the applicable party obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") notice of any matter which the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Article VII (a "Claim"), within thirty (30) days
of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method
of computation thereof. If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any
claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided
for in this Article VII ("Third Party Claims"), the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim within ten (10)
days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice. The failure to
provide notice of a Claim or a Third Party Claim as provided for in this
subsection shall not release the applicable Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article VII unless such failure causes actual
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party hereunder, in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be released only to the extent of such prejudice.   (d)
Procedures for Third Party Claims. The obligations and liabilities of an
Indemnifying Party under this Article VII with respect to Losses arising from
Third Party Claims shall be governed by and be contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if there exists or is reasonably
likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in
the judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for the fees   41    and expenses of more than one counsel,
in addition to local counsel, for all Indemnified Parties). In the event the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate, and shall use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents to cooperate, with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the
Indemnified Party\'s control, and shall use its best efforts to cause its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents to make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the possession or under the
control of any of them, relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate, and shall use its best efforts to cause its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents to cooperate, with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under
the Indemnifying Party\'s control, and shall use its best efforts to
cause its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents to make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all
witnesses, records, materials and information in the possession or under the
control of any of them, relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that if the Indemnified Party does not consent to
such a settlement and such settlement involves solely monetary damages, then
in no event may the Indemnifying Party\'s liability to the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim exceed the amount of the proposed
settlement.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION AND WAIVER   SECTION 8.01
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing (the "Termination Date"):   (a) by the Purchaser if, between the

Purchaser\'s receipt of written notice of such breach from the Seller;  
42     (c) by the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred by July 30, 2006; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(c) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or prior to such date;   (d) by either the Purchaser or the
Seller in the event that any Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
any of such rights.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 9.01
