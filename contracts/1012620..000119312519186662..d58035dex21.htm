applicable Law to (i) ensure that the Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate in
its entirety immediately prior to the Effective Time and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the Stock Purchase Plan thereafter, (ii)
ensure that no enrollment for offering periods under the Stock Purchase Plan
shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the

but in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date following
the Closing Date, the applicable former holders of Options, Stock Units and
PSUs will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation, through its
payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such
former holders in respect of Options, Stock Units and PSUs that were cancelled
and converted pursuant to _Sections 2.2(a)_ , _2.2(b)_ or  _2.2(c)_ , as
applicable (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided

Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder (less
applicable withholding Taxes), which check will be sent by courier to such
holder as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date (but
in any event on or prior to the next regularly scheduled payroll date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such amounts relate to
a Company Equity Award that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall pay such amounts at the earliest
time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such Company Equity Award that will not trigger a tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the
Company shall become entitled pursuant  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, a cash amount in immediately available funds that, when taken
together with cash available on the Companys balance sheet that is deposited
with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, are sufficient in the aggregate
to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. With respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall not be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the Per Share Merger Consideration
that would be payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if such Dissenting
Shares were not Dissenting Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund
lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_
shall not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 2.3(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any (" _Certificates_ "),
and, if required by the Paying Agent, each former holder of record of Shares
held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than holders of
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including
a letter of transmittal in customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of evidence,
if any, of the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request, such transmittal materials to be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of Certificates to the Paying Agent,
each holder of record of one or more Certificates, if any, shall be entitled
to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ __ (A) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificates by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates
so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be
required to deliver a Certificate to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of evidence, if any, of the book-entry
transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the Paying Agent may reasonably request be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a
cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ _ _ (A) the number of Shares represented by
such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-
Entry Shares.

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates is
registered, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificates may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the
Certificates

 formerly representing such Shares so surrendered are properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form and accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or
other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made
to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if
applicable, with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 2.3(b)_, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such
holders claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and
acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Article
II_ , it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ (without interest and less applicable withholding
Taxes). The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates
or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message", if applicable, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance

 



-8- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (and any agent thereof) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares, Options, Stock Units and PSUs such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (as
reasonably determined by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(or any agent thereof)). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any
agent thereof), as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares, Options, Stock Units and PSUs (as the case may be) in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 SECTION 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby) any Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have
not voted such Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and who are
entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, have complied in all respects
with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_, unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Persons right to appraisal or
payment under the DGCL, at which time such Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, without interest and after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and such Shares
shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to
have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each Dissenting Share shall
no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and
shall cease to exist at the Effective Time, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of, and as
provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise
lost or failed to perfect such Persons right to appraisal or payment under
the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal or withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company
relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands,
or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with the
provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in the event that the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a
different number of Shares or securities or a different class as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination,
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Shares, Options, Stock Units and PSUs the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any
subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in equity for the periods

 and the financial institutions party thereto (including all exhibits,
schedules, and annexes thereto, and the executed fee letter associated
therewith and referenced therein (except that the fee letter is subject to
redactions further described below), as may be amended or modified in
accordance with the terms hereof, collectively, the " _Debt_ _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the lenders thereto have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set
forth therein (the " _Debt_ _Financing_ ") for the purposes of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and related fees and expenses
and the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness of the Company and (b)
the executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof, from each
Guarantor (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the "
_Equity Financing Commitment_ ", and, together with the Debt Financing
Commitments, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which each
Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ ", and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The
Equity Financing Commitment provides that the Company is a third-party
beneficiary thereof, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
and herein. None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement no such
amendment or modification is contemplated (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, amendments to the Debt Financing Commitments solely to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties
thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date
hereof), and as of the date of this Agreement the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. Except for fee letters (complete copies of which have been
provided to the Company, with only fee amounts, "market flex" (other than any
structure flex) and other economic terms redacted), as of the date hereof
there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof
and except for any agreements among the Guarantors which do not affect the
availability of the Equity Financing. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and Parent will, directly or
indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as
and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that any payment due and payable on the Closing Date shall be
funded contemporaneously with the Closing and subject to the satisfaction of
the other funding conditions in respect of the Financing on the Closing Date.
As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect with respect to, and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of, Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof.
As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of
Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing
Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub or any other party thereto under the Financing
Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the Financing Commitments being
unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent has

 



-32- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments applicable to it will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Commitments and the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the
Closing Date funds sufficient to (A) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration and the other payments under _Article II_ , (B) pay any and all
fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Financing, (C)
pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its
subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments and
(D) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation contemplated hereunder. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the
Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 SECTION 4.9 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent has furnished the Company with a
true, complete and correct copy of each Parent Guarantee. Each Parent
Guarantee is in full force and effect and has not been amended or
modified. Each Parent Guarantee is a (i) legal, valid and binding obligation
of the applicable Guarantor and of each of the other parties thereto and (ii)
enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against the applicable
Guarantor and each of the other parties subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. There is no default under the Parent Guarantee by the applicable
Guarantor, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the applicable
Guarantor.

SECTION 4.10 _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities that are convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or
vote any Shares (other than pursuant to this Agreement).

 SECTION 4.11 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(other than Merger Sub) is necessary to approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The adoption of this
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have
occurred immediately following the execution of this Agreement) is the only
vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

SECTION 4.12 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived, (b) the Required
Information fairly presents the consolidated financial condition of the
Company as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of earnings of the Company for the periods covered thereby, (c) the
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, (d) the
representations and warranties of the Company in  _Article III_ are accurate
and (e) the most recent projections, forecasts or estimates of the Company and
its subsidiaries that have been provided to Parent have been prepared in good
faith based on assumptions that were reasonable at such time, then

entitled under _Article II_ , funding of any obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or its subsidiaries which become due or payable by the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the
Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation
and each of its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will not: (i) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair
market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is
less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing
debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have
unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts, or be
expected to incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond

Corporation following the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 4.14 _No Other Information_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub.

Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) the documents provided by the Company
for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) has been
afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers
of the Company and (d) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company and its subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or
other statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement and that all other
representations and warranties are specifically disclaimed. Without limiting
the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub further acknowledges and agrees
that none of the Company or any of its stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives has made any
representation or warranty concerning any estimates, projections, forecasts,
business plans or other forward-looking information regarding the Company, its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses and operations. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in

and other forward-looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub are
familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for
making their own

thereto.

counterparty) after granting any such waiver, amendment or release and the
Board of Directors of the Company determines prior to the grant of such
waiver, amendment or release in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of the Board of Directors of
the Company to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ by any of the Companys subsidiaries, or any of
the Companys or its subsidiaries respective Representatives acting on the
Companys or one of its subsidiaries behalf, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, this Agreement shall not prevent the Company or its

 counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, that (i) such proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the actions specified in
clause (A) or (B) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ would be reasonably likely

or its Board of Directors may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
(A) make a Change of Recommendation or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Company pays to Parent
the Company Termination Payment required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _

that such termination shall not be effective unless such fee is so paid);
_provided further_ that the Company will not be entitled to make a Change of

_Company Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Companys Board of Directors
proposes to take such action and containing the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Board
of Directors of the Company (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal and a written summary of any material terms and conditions
communicated orally), and shall include with such notice unredacted copies of
the proposed transaction agreement (if any) and copies of any other documents
evidencing or specifying the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, and (y) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the third Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Company Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is
provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the third Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (it being understood that any material revision, amendment, update or
supplement to the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be
deemed to constitute a new Superior Proposal and shall require a new notice
but with an additional two Business Day (instead of three Business Day) period
from the date of such notice), the " _Notice Period_ "), the Board of
Directors of the Company reaffirms in good faith (1) after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if the adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent (if any) were to be
given effect and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make a Change of Recommendation or so terminate would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its
subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or
their Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _
6.3_ to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, in
response to an Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company or its Board of Directors may, prior to obtaining
the Company Requisite Vote, make a Change of Recommendation;  _provided_ that
the Company will not be entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, a
Change of Recommendation unless (i) the Company delivers to Parent a written
notice (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Companys
Board of Directors proposes to take such action and containing the material
facts underlying the Companys Board of

or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Intervening Event Notice
(such period from the time the Intervening Event Notice is provided until 5:00
p.m. New York City time on the third Business Day immediately following the
day on which the Company delivered the Intervening Event Notice (it being
understood that any material development with respect to an Intervening Event
shall require a new notice but with an additional two Business Day (instead of
three Business Day) period from the date of such notice), the " _Intervening
Event Notice Period_ "), the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by
Parent, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its or their Representatives to, during
the Intervening Event Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Change of
Recommendation.

7.1(b)(ii)(A)_) are reasonably expected to be satisfied prior to the STB
approving, authorizing or exempting the Merger and the other transactions

immediately following the Effective Time, and file with the STB all

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

other in advance, and consider in good faith the other Partys reasonable
comments in connection with, any filing, notice, application, submission,

other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person; and (vi) take any action (including those set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)(vi)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) in
order to (A) obtain all requisite or advisable approvals and authorizations,
or permit the expiration of waiting periods, for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any applicable Law or (B) obtain the approval,
authorization or exemption of any Governmental Entity for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case of the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B), with respect to any such approval, authorization, waiting period or

satisfy the condition in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ within the first period of

decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in connection with any planned divestiture by Parent
of the Companys interests in GandW Australia Holdings LP to a third party (the
" _Snow Australia Divestiture_ "), the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to reasonably assist and
reasonably cooperate with Parent, at Parents sole cost and expense, in
Parents efforts to consummate the Snow Australia Divestiture in the most

actions or nonactions by, any Governmental Entity or any third party, and
making, or causing to be made, all other necessary registrations, declarations

the Company and its subsidiaries and (y) none of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fee or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Snow Australia Divestiture or be required to
take any action that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to

to provide any indemnity in connection with the Snow Australia Divestiture or
any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
none of the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors (with respect to any subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall
be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Snow Australia Divestiture that is not contingent upon the Closing or that

communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ or

meeting or communication. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(g)_, and in
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall

6.4(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, with respect to which Parents
obligations are as set forth in Section 6.4(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter) to (x) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any,
that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law or other applicable Laws requiring receipt
of the Other Regulatory Approvals or (y) avoid the entry of, effect the
dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree,
order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the contemplated transactions, so as to enable the Parties to
close the contemplated transactions expeditiously (but in no event later than
the End Date), including, but without limiting the foregoing, and in each
case, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(g)_, (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders or

Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each member of the Parent
Group to, cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,

is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub
must defend, at their cost and expense, any action or actions, whether
judicial or administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to agree to any term or take any action with respect to any term in
connection with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ that is
not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or equity interests, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
6.4_, the Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, provide sensitive
information and materials of a Party to the other Party on an outside counsel-
only basis or directly to the applicable Governmental Entity while, to the
extent feasible, making a version in which the sensitive information has been
redacted available to the other Party. Materials provided to the other Party
or its counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company, privileged communications, or other sensitive material.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ (but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(i)_) shall (i)
require (A) any of Parent, any of its Affiliates or direct or indirect equity
holders of Parent (including the Guarantors) or their respective Affiliates
or any investment funds advised or managed by one or more Affiliates of

 Parent (or any Guarantor) or any direct or indirect portfolio companies
thereof to agree or commit to any imposition of any condition or restriction
with respect to any such Person or their respective businesses, product lines
or assets (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its
subsidiaries) necessary to secure the requisite approvals and authorizations
or expiration of waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any applicable Law or to obtain the approval, authorization or
exemption of any Governmental Entity or (B) the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders
(including the Guarantors) or their Affiliates or investment funds advised or
managed by one or more Affiliates of Parent (or any direct or indirect
portfolio companies thereof) to propose, negotiate, agree, accept, commit to
or effect, by consent decree, hold-separate or administrative order or
otherwise, a Company Remedial Measure that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that a Snow Australia
Divestiture or a voting trust contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ shall
not be deemed to be, and shall not be taken into account in determining
whether a Company Remedial Measure would reasonably be expected to result in,
a Material Adverse Effect) (the matters described in clauses (A) and (B)
above, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ") or (ii) permit the Company and its
subsidiaries and other Affiliates to, without Parents prior written approval,
agree or commit to the imposition of any condition or restriction necessary
to secure the requisite approvals and authorizations or expiration of waiting
periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Law or to obtain the approval, authorization or exemption of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring Parent or Merger Sub to provide, or cause to be provided or agree
or commit to provide, any non-public financial information with respect to GIC
Private Limited or any of its Affiliates or any entity managed or advised by
GIC Private Limited (other than of the type or to the extent previously
provided to a Governmental Entity in previous applications under substantially
similar standards of confidentiality), and no failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to cause the provision of such information to a Governmental Entity shall be
deemed a breach of any provision in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub;
provided, however, that, in the event any such information is requested but
not provided, Parent shall enter into good faith discussions with the Company
and the Governmental Entity to, and use its reasonable best efforts to,
provide other information, within the constraints imposed on GIC Private
Limited and its Affiliates by applicable Law, organizational documents,
existing internal policies and past practices, that attempts in good faith to
address the topic(s) of inquiry then being made by such Governmental Entity.

 

(h) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material Contracts in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in seeking timely to obtain any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries will make or agree to make any payment of
a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary or economic
value for the purposes of obtaining any such consents without the prior
consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during
normal business hours to the Companys and its subsidiaries officers,
employees, properties, books and records, as necessary to facilitate

 prompt and timely discharge by such officers, employees and other authorized
Representatives of their normal duties and shall not include any environmental
sampling or testing. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or contravene any applicable Law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or disclose information in reliance on
the immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it
is withholding such access or information and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not waive such privilege or violate the applicable Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement, including
entering into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other
similar arrangement. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other
Person designated by the Company.

representatives to hold, treat and use, in confidence all non-public
documents and information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries

effect in accordance with their respective terms.

 

SECTION 6.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the New York Stock
Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act at the Effective Time.

SECTION 6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger
shall be a joint press release and, except in connection with an Acquisition

Agreement, thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including providing each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public announcement, and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect to any such press release or other public announcement, except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity, in each case,
as determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such
release (in which case, such Party shall

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other Party). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates may provide
ordinary course communications regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to existing or prospective general and limited partners,
equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of such
Person, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality

SECTION 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For at least the period ending on the later of (x) 12 months following
the Effective Time and (y) December 31, 2020 (the " _Benefit Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to
be employed by the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) a salary, wage, target annual
cash bonus opportunity and commissions opportunity that, in each case, is no
less favorable than the salary, wage, target bonus opportunity and
commissions opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee pension, welfare and
other benefits (other than equity compensation, defined pension benefits,
retiree medical and life insurance benefits) that have an aggregate value that
is substantially comparable to the employee pension, welfare and other
benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than equity compensation, defined pension benefits,
retiree medical and life insurance benefits). Parent intends to implement a
long term incentive plan during the Benefit Continuation Period in amounts and
on terms and conditions as determined by Parent. For the duration of the
Benefit Continuation Period, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain
for the benefit of each Continuing Employee a severance or termination
arrangement no less favorable than the severance or termination arrangement
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.
This  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ shall not apply to Continuing Employees whose
terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining
agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and
assumed, the terms of all Company Plans that remain in effect as of the
Effective Time, subject to the amendment and termination provisions thereof.

(c) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in
which Continuing Employees participate, Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Company and any subsidiaries thereof) shall (i) waive or cause
to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-
at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under a comparable Company Plans, (ii)
give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made and (iii) to the extent that it would not result in a duplication of
benefits and to the extent that such service was recognized under a similar
Company Plan, give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Company for purposes of eligibility

 



-53- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if
such service had been performed with Parent.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any Affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit
or other applicable plan, policy or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating
any Company Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create any third-
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or any collective
bargaining representative thereof.

SECTION 6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, to the extent
acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time in such
Persons capacity as a director or officer of the Company, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law and its Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person (and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding, including
any expenses incurred in successfully enforcing such Persons rights under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, regardless of whether indemnification with respect
to or advancement of such expenses is authorized under the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; _provided_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_). In the event of any
such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent relates only to monetary damages for
which the Surviving Corporation is 

 



-54- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 entirely responsible or includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such
matter. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party
and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Party
promptly after statements therefor are received, if the Surviving Corporation
shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iv) no
Indemnified Party shall be liable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent;
provided that for purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii) the Indemnified Party on
behalf of whom fees and expenses are paid provides an undertaking to repay
such fees and expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_).

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 6.10_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying Party.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the provisions in
the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former
or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such
directors and officers than such provisions contained in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(d) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years
from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. At
Parents option, in lieu of maintaining such current policies, the Company
shall purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no
later than the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
no less advantageous in the aggregate to the insured than the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay in the aggregate for such coverage
under each such

 



-55- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 policy more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In the event the Company
elects to purchase such a "tail policy", the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy"
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and
perform under, all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party.

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 6.10_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall survive the Merger
and, following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

 

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the comparable
governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it
being understood that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 

SECTION 6.11 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall, or shall cause its applicable subsidiaries to,
arrange for customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge to be
delivered at Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on
the Closing Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness under the Credit
Facility, and shall deliver, or cause its applicable subsidiaries to deliver,
prepayment and termination notices in accordance with the terms of such
indebtedness (provided that such prepayment and termination notices may be
conditional on the occurrence of the Closing).

 

SECTION 6.12 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full
force and effect the Financing Commitments until the earliest of the

 consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of
this Agreement or the time at which any Alternative Financing is obtained,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis, to the extent within their control, all
conditions to funding in the Debt Financing Commitments and such definitive
agreements to be entered into pursuant thereto (including by consummating the
Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing), (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions described
in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any "flex" provisions contained
therein) or otherwise consistent in all material respects with the Debt
Financing Commitments and on other terms that would not (A) reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would be
less than an amount that would be required to consummate the Merger and make
the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation hereunder or otherwise contemplated in connection herewith and
repay or refinance the debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount) or (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely
amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in each
case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the receipt of the Debt Financing prior to the Closing Date, (iv)
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments and (v) in the event
that all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments have been satisfied,
cause the lenders and other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing
Commitment upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing). To the extent
reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing (or Alternative Financing) and Parent shall provide
to the Company copies of all documents reasonably requested by the Company
related to the Financing (or Alternative Financing), except that provisions
related to fees, pricing, "market flex" (other than any structure flex) and
other customary economic terms may be redacted in a customary manner;
_provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any
obligation to disclose any information that (x) is subject to attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege or doctrine if Parent or Merger
Sub shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to disclose such
information in a manner that would not waive such privilege or doctrine or (y)
would contravene any applicable Law. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments for any reason (A) Parent shall promptly notify
the Company in writing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall
cause their respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount, when added with Parent and Merger
Subs existing cash on hand and the Equity Financing Commitment, sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, which would not (i)
involve terms and conditions that are materially less beneficial to Parent or
Merger Sub, (ii) involve any conditions to funding the Debt Financing that
are not contained in the Debt Financing Commitments and (iii) would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Debt Financing or such Alternative Financing or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without

 limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing (A) if Parent becomes aware that there exists any breach,
default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the
Financing Commitments (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination), (B) of the
receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or other written
communication from any lender or other debt financing source with respect to
any actual breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any
party to the Financing Commitments or (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger
Sub believes in good faith that (I) there is (or there is reasonably likely to
be) a dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitments or any definitive document related to the Financing or (II) there
is a reasonable possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing on the material terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents
related to the Financing (including the "flex" provisions set forth in the fee
letter). As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested in writing by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence that is in Parents possession; _provided_ , that in no
event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any
information that (x) is subject to attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege or doctrine if Parent or Merger Sub shall have used its
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a manner that
would not waive such privilege or doctrine or (y) would contravene any
applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor shall not (without the prior
written consent of the Company) consent or agree to any amendment,

State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law or conflict of
law principles thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would cause the

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties agree that any
claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action of any kind or nature (whether
based upon contract, tort or otherwise) involving a Lender Related Party that

separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an

agreement.

 

SECTION 9.12 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including

consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions, and accordingly, but subject to _Section_ __
_ 9.12(b)_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms

or in equity. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.12(b)_, the Parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing if, and only
if, (i) Parent is required to complete the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.2_ and Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (ii) the
financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or, if applicable,
the Alternative Financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company
has confirmed that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur.

 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, for the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may concurrently seek (i) specific
performance or other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee if, as
and when required pursuant to this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Financing Commitment), on the one hand, and payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to submit itself to the
sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.4_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process
in accordance with

 



-79- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would
hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to
which the Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America; _provided_ that each such Partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ is solely
for the purpose referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and shall not be
deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware
other than for such purpose.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or
support any litigation against any Lender Related Party under the Debt
Financing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the
City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any such action, suit or proceeding. The parties hereto further agree to waive
and hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now have or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and makes the agreements, waivers and consents set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.13(a)_ mutatis mutandis but with respect to the
courts specified in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13(b)_.

 

SECTION 9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING ANY LENDER RELATED
PARTY UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 

SECTION 9.15 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Exhibit, Schedule or Section, such reference shall be to an
Article, Exhibit, Schedule or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words

and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ")
except as otherwise provided by applicable law. The number of directors of the
Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by, or in the manner provided in,
the By-Laws of the Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "). Election of directors
need not be by written ballot unless the By-Laws shall so provide.

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

SEVENTH: The Board of Directors may make, alter or repeal the By-Laws except
as otherwise provided in the By-Laws adopted by the Corporations
stockholders.

 

EIGHTH: (a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made
party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"),
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by the indemnitee in connection therewith, and such indemnification
shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section (b) of this Article 8 with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article
8 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance
of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided,
however, that, if the DGCL so requires, an advancement of expenses incurred
by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in
any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including without limitation service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final
adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such
expenses under this Article 8 or otherwise.

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(b) If a claim under Section (a) of this Article 8 is not paid in full by
the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by
the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses,
in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may
at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such
suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In
any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
hereunder (other than a suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to
an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not
met the applicable standard of conduct set froth forth in the DGCL. In any
suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover
such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense of such a suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to
such indemnification or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article 8
or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.

(c) The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
conferred by this Article 8 shall not be exclusive of any other right which
any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended or
supplemented, the By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the DGCL.

(e) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article 8 with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.

NINTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is
hereafter amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of a director
of the Corporation, then a director of the Corporation, in addition to the
circumstances set forth here, shall have no liability as a director (or such
liability shall be eliminated) to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as
so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article NINTH by the
stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions for or with respect
to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such repeal or
modification.

 

TENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred herein upon
the Corporations stockholders, directors and officers are granted subject to
this reservation.
