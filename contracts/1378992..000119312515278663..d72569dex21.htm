to or greater than the Per Share Portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration, shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time.
Subject to compliance by each Company SARs Holder with _Section 3.2(c)_ and,
in each case, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and any
Company SARs Holder with respect to any of such Company SARs Holders Company
SARs, (I) all payments of Company SARs Closing Consideration shall be made
(without interest) by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation to such
Company SARs Holder no later than the next payroll payment date, but in no
event sooner than three Business Days, after the Closing Date, and (II) all
payments of the Remaining Amount (if any) or Excess Amount (if any) shall be
made (without interest) by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation to such
Company SARs Holder no later than the next payroll payment date, but in no
event sooner than three Business Days, after the receipt thereof by the
Surviving Corporation.

 



17 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Company Common
Stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Company Common Stock Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_, but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and each such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Company Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
3.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(f) All payments by the Surviving Corporation to any Company Optionholder,
Company RSU Holder, and Company SARs Holder pursuant to this Agreement shall
be reduced for any applicable state, local, or Federal tax withholding and
other payroll tax obligations, as calculated by the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.2 _Estimated Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting

_Estimated Working Capital Amount_ "), (ii) the estimated amount of Funded
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Funded Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the estimated
amount of Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (iv) the estimated amount of the
Company Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_
"), and (v) the estimated amount of Capital Expenditures (the " _Estimated
Capital Expenditures_ ") (which in the case of any Capital Expenditures
incurred after the latest month-end Capital Expenditure report, which report
shall tie to the Companys regular monthly financial statements for such
month-end, shall include reasonable supporting detail for such Capital
Expenditures), in each case as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and based on the Companys books and
records and other information available at the time.

 



18 (b) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each
Company Common Stockholder that holds Company Common Stock (other than the
Specified Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount equal to
the aggregate Company Common Stockholder Closing Consideration of such Company
Common Stockholder in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. At the
Closing, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Escrow Agent
an amount to be held in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement equal to $50,000,000 (the " _Escrow Funds_ ").

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall mail or otherwise deliver to each Company Common Stockholder a Letter of
Transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which for the avoidance of doubt, shall include
the obligation of each Company Common Stockholder to agree to _Section 10.15_
of this Agreement, together with any notice required pursuant to Section 262\.
Upon the delivery of any duly executed Letter of Transmittal, each such
Company Common Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the Company Common Stock Merger Consideration in
respect of its, his or her shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(d) All cash paid upon the surrender of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Securityholder Representative
or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 3.3 _Company Transaction Expenses_. Simultaneously with the Closing,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Company
Transaction Expenses in accordance with wire transfer instructions provided by
each payee thereof.

 

Section 3.4 _Funded Indebtedness_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent
shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company, all Funded
Indebtedness of the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with wire transfer instructions set forth in payoff letters or
redemption notices provided to Parent by the Company prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs prior to October 8,
2015, Parent shall not be required to pay the Waynesboro Buyout Amount to the
equipment lessor under the Waynesboro Equipment Lease until October 8, 2015.

 



19 Section 3.5 _Paying Agent_. Citibank, N.A. shall act, at Parents expense, as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in effecting the exchanges provided for
herein pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "). Each
Company Common Stockholder shall receive from the Paying Agent or the Escrow
Agent, as applicable, in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock such
Company Common Stockholder holds, by wire transfer of same day funds (i) on
the Closing Date, the Per Share Portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration,
(ii) the Per Share Portion of the Remaining Amount, if any, at the time of its
distribution and (iii) the Per Share Portion of the Excess Amount, if any, at
the time of its distribution.

Section 3.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Securityholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Parents good faith calculation of the Companys Working
Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital
Expenditures, in each case, as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date together with reasonable supporting
detail of each of the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement.

 

(b) During the 60 days immediately following the Securityholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "),
the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted
to review Parents working papers and the working papers of Parents
independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness,
Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures therein, as well
as the relevant books and records of the Company and Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the independent accountants of Parent shall not be obligated
to make any working papers available to the Securityholder Representative
unless and until the Securityholder Representative has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants. The Securityholder Representative shall notify Parent
in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the
Review Period if the Securityholder Representative disagrees with the Closing
Statement or the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash, Company
Transaction Expenses or Capital Expenditures set forth therein. The Notice of
Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the amounts involved and the Securityholder Representatives
determination of the amount of the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness,
Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures, in each case, as
of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. 

(c) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall seek in good
faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If no Notice of Disagreement
is received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of the Review
Period, then the Closing Statement and the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures set

 



20  forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Securityholder Representative and shall become final and binding upon Parent
and the Equity Holders. If the parties cannot agree on the Working Capital,
Funded Indebtedness, Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital
Expenditures within such 30 day period, the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash, Company Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures, in
each case solely to the extent not agreed between the Securityholder
Representative and Parent, shall be determined by KPMG LLP (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "). The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall furnish
the Independent Accountant with a statement setting forth the items from the
Notice of Disagreement which are still in dispute (the " _Independent
Accountant Dispute Notice_ "). In the event that KPMG LLP refuses or is
otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, the Securityholder
Representative and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national
recognition mutually agreeable to the Securityholder Representative and
Parent, in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within
30 days after the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or
as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on
the Securityholder Representative and Parent, of the appropriate amount of
each of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is
disagreement as specified in the Independent Accountant Dispute Notice. With
respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either the Securityholder Representative or Parent, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by the Securityholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement
or Parent in the Closing Statement with respect to such disputed line item.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not review any
line items or make any determination with respect to any matter other than
those matters in the Independent Accountant Dispute Notice that are in dispute
and shall make such decision based solely on the provisions of this
Agreement. The statement of Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash,
Company Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures as of 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
the determination of the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash, Company
Transaction Expenses and Capital Expenditures therefrom that are final and
binding on the Securityholder Representative and Parent, as determined either
through agreement of the Securityholder Representative and Parent (deemed or
otherwise) or through the determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant
to this _Section 3.6(c)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Working
Capital Amount_ ," " _Final Funded Indebtedness_ ," " _Final Cash,_ " "
_Final Company Transaction Expenses_ " and " _Final Capital Expenditures_ ,"
respectively. During the review by the Independent Accountant, the
Securityholder Representative and Parent shall each make available to the
Independent Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records
and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant
to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 3.6(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the independent accountants of the Securityholder
Representative or Parent shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent
Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 



21 (d) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination
shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Equity Holders, on
the other (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the Securityholder
Representative from the Escrow Funds).

 

(e) The " _Final Merger Consideration_ " shall be calculated by recalculating
the Estimated Merger Consideration using the Final Working Capital Amount in
lieu of the Estimated Working Capital Amount, using the Final Funded
Indebtedness in lieu of Estimated Funded Indebtedness, using Final Cash in
lieu of Estimated Cash, using the Final Company Transaction Expenses in lieu
of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, and using the Final Capital
Expenditures in lieu of Estimated Capital Expenditures, and otherwise using
the components of Estimated Merger Consideration as set forth in
the definition of Estimated Merger Consideration.

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "),
Parent shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds promptly (but in any
event within three Business Days after the Final Working Capital Amount,
Final Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash, Final Company Transaction Expenses and
Final Capital Expenditures have been agreed upon or determined by the
Independent Accountant), such Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Account;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , in no event shall any Equity Holder have personal
liability for payment of such amount or any portion thereof, and Parents sole
recourse with respect thereto shall be the Escrow Funds held by the Escrow
Agent.

 

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "),
Parent shall promptly (but in any event within three Business Days after the
Final Working Capital Amount, Final Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash, Final
Company Transaction Expenses and Final Capital Expenditures have been agreed
upon or determined by the Independent Accountant) pay the Excess Amount by
wire transfer of same day funds to the Paying Agent (on behalf of and as agent
of the Company Common Stockholders) and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf
of and as agent of the Company RSU Holders, the Company Optionholders and the
Company SARs Holders).

 

(iii) If any Escrow Funds remain in the Escrow Account after the payment of
the Deficiency Amount or if there is no Deficiency Amount (such amount, the "
_Remaining Amount_ "), the Remaining Amount shall be released to the Paying
Agent (on behalf of and as agent of the Company Common Stockholders) and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of and as agent of the Company RSU Holders,
the Company Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders).

Parent and the Securityholder Representative hereby agree to deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow
Account all funds to be delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.6(e)_.

 



22 (f) All payments made to the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company
Common Stockholders) and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company
RSU Holders, the Company Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders) pursuant
to and in accordance with _Section 3.6(e)_ shall be made as follows:

 

(i) to each Company Common Stockholder that holds any Company Common Stock
(other than Specified Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_ (B)
the aggregate amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company RSU Holders, the Company
Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders) pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)(ii)_
or _Section 3.6(e)(iii)_, as applicable, _multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate
number of such shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Common
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) to the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company RSU Holders), an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_ (B)
the aggregate amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company RSU Holders, the Company
Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders) pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)(ii)_
or _Section 3.6(e)(iii)_, as applicable, _multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Awards
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) to the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company Optionholders),
an amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_
(B) the aggregate amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company RSU Holders, the Company
Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders) pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)(ii)_
or _Section 3.6(e)(iii)_, as applicable, _multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portions of
all Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(iv) to the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company SARs Holders), an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_ (B)
the aggregate amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders and the
Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company RSU Holders, the Company
Optionholders and the Company SARs Holders) pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)(ii)_
or _Section 3.6(e)(iii)_, as applicable, _multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portions of
all Company SARs immediately prior to the Effective Time;

_provided_ , that no payment of Remaining Amount or Excess Amount shall be
made to any Company Optionholder, Company SARs Holder or Company RSU Holder
after the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time; each Company Optionholder,
Company SARs Holder or Company RSU Holder shall forfeit his, her or its right
to any unpaid Remaining Amount or Excess Amount as of the date immediately
following the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time; and all such payments
shall otherwise be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



23 (g) Each of the Estimated Closing Statement (including the Estimated
Working Capital Amount, Estimated Funded Indebtedness, Estimated Cash,
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and Estimated Capital Expenditures) and
the Closing Statement (including the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness,
Cash, Company Transaction Expenses Transaction Expenses and Capital
Expenditures) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the

or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) be based on facts and circumstances as
they exist up to the Closing; (iii) shall exclude the effect of any act,

in preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet; (iv) with respect to the
calculation of the Estimated Working Capital Amount and Working Capital,
include the same line accounts (and only those line accounts) set forth on

Equity Holders, deliver to Citibank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as agent
to Parent and the Equity Holders, a portion of the Estimated Merger

Agreement does not, and the execution, delivery and performance of the other

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and compliance by Parent and
Merger Sub with the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with,

bound or (iii) any judgment or applicable Law applicable to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective properties, rights or

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the

ability to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

Section 5.4 _Litigation_. There are not any (a) outstanding judgments against
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries, (b) Actions pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Subsidiaries or (c) investigations by any Governmental Entity
that are, to the Knowledge of Parent, pending or threatened against Parent,

materially impair or delay each of Parents or Merger Subs ability to perform
its respective obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.5 _Ownership and Operations_. Parent owns of record and
beneficially owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub.
Merger Sub was formed

 



40  solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
and has engaged in no other business or other activities or incurred any
liabilities, other than in connection with or as contemplated in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

Section 5.6 _Debt Financing; SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) The amount of funds contemplated to be provided pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter (as defined below) will be sufficient, if funded, to (a)
pay the Closing Payments, (b) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be
paid by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including the Merger and the
Debt Financing and (c) satisfy all of its other payment obligations
contemplated hereby. Parent has furnished the Company with true, complete and
correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof
among BPC and the Debt Financing Sources and excerpts of those portions of
each executed fee letter associated therewith that contain any conditions to
funding (excluding provisions related solely to fees and "flex" (none of
which flex provisions would adversely affect the amount, conditionality,
enforceability, termination or availability of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the financing contemplated by, the Debt
Financing) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has advised the Company of the maximum amount of fees and
expenses payable by BPC under the Debt Financing) and economic terms (other
than covenants) agreed to by the parties) regarding the terms and conditions
of the financing to be provided by such commitment letter and attached hereto
as _Exhibit E_ (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto, and each such fee letter, collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement,
no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and the commitments
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect. Except for a fee letter with respect to the fees and related
arrangements (in each case, that do not adversely affect the amount,
conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of, or contain any
conditions precedent to, the funding of the financing contemplated by, the
Debt Financing), there are no side letters or other Contracts or
arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2_, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will
be sufficient when funded to pay the Closing Payments and any other payment
contemplated in this Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect. The Debt Commitment Letter
is (x) a legal, valid and binding obligation of BPC and, to the knowledge of
Parent, each of the other parties thereto and (y) enforceable in accordance
with its terms against BPC and each of the other parties thereto except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). No event
has occurred which, with or without

 



41  notice, lapse of time or both would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent
on the part of BPC or any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment
Letter. All commitments and other fees (if any) required to be paid under the
Debt Commitment Letter prior to the date hereof have been fully paid and
Parent will cause BPC to continue to timely pay in full any such amounts
arising under the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become payable, and
Parent is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that
would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material
respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause any material provision
of the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective. Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that the
Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on or prior to the Closing
Date, nor to the knowledge of Parent, does have any reason to believe that
any of the Debt Financing Sources will not perform its obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Parent or Merger Sub obtain financing for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Parent has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, definitive
proxy statements and other documents (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Reports_ ") required to be filed by Parent with the SEC. The Parent SEC
Reports have been compiled in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the SEC.

 

(c) Parent has previously provided the Company with (i) the audited
consolidated balance sheets of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 27,
2014, and the related audited consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 27, 2014 together
with the notes and schedules thereto (together, the " _Audited Parent
Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of March 28, 2015 and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2015 (together, the " _Unaudited Parent
Financial Statements_ " and, collectively with the Audited Parent Financial
Statements, the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ").

 

(d) In each case, (i) the Parent Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, except in the case of the
Unaudited Parent Financial Statements, the absence of full footnote
disclosures and schedules and normal year-end audit adjustments, and (ii) the
Parent Financial Statements are true, correct and complete in all material
respects and present fairly in all material respects, as of their respective
dates and for the periods set forth therein, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows, as the case may be, of Parent
and its Subsidiaries.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved on a consolidated
balance sheet of Parent (or the notes thereto) other than (i) those reflected
on the Parent Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business after March 31, 2015, (iii) liabilities

 



42  incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv)
liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 5.7 _Brokers and Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders or
financial advisors fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any
liability prior to Closing.

Section 6.2 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) During the one-year period following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall

cause its Affiliates to, provide to each Company Non-Unionized Employee who
incurs a Qualified Termination during the one-year period following the

45  Company Non-Unionized Employee would have been entitled under the
appropriate Company Benefit Plan applicable to such Company Non-Unionized
Employee as of January 1, 2015. For purposes of this _Section 6.2_, a "
_Qualified Termination_ " shall mean (i) any termination of employment which
would entitle the participant to severance benefits under the applicable
severance plan, or (ii) a resignation of employment by a Company Non-
Unionized Employee within 30 days following a material reduction or written

Employees total annual cash compensation opportunity. 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to give
Company Non-Unionized Employees full credit for such Company Non-Unionized
Employees service with the Company and its Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits (including
for purposes of vacation, disability and severance) to the same
extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing, under any
benefit plans made available to employees or officers or any class or level of
employees or officers of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which a Company
Non-Unionized Employee participates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

 

(d) To the extent permitted under the terms of the applicable plan (as the
same may be amended) and by any applicable insurer, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to take commercially reasonable steps to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to
Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or
any of its Affiliates that provides health benefits in which Company Employees
may be eligible to participate following the Closing, to the extent waived or
satisfied with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and
out-of-pocket maximums incurred by Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior
to the Closing during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing
in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were
incurred provided adequate and applicable data regarding any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred during the plan year are provided
in reasonable detail from Parent or Affiliates health insurance provider, and
(iii) except with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which provides for
equity compensation, waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each
case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied
any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing.

(e) With respect to Company Unionized Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates, as applicable, to assume and honor and continue in full force
and effect the collective bargaining agreements set forth in Section 4.17 of

_CBAs_ ") and provide such Company Unionized Employees with compensation and
benefits as set forth in the CBAs.

 



46 (f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to seek approval by the Company Common Stockholders, to the extent required
by and in the manner prescribed under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, of the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to
receive or retain any payments that could, in the absence of such approval by
the Company Common Stockholders, constitute "excess parachute payments" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(g) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth
in this _Section 6.2_ shall not create any right in any Company Employee or
any other person to any continued employment with the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates, successors, or assigns.

Section 6.3  _Publicity_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall communicate and cooperate with each other
prior to any press release or public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, agree that no public release or announcement
concerning the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
by any party without the prior written consent of the other party, except
such release or announcement as may be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
Companys Affiliates or Parent or one of its Affiliates are listed, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance.

provided to it and its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between BPC and the Company, dated as of April 9,

Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and _Section
6.4_, Parent shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and
Representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to have such
access to the properties, businesses and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and such examination of the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written
notice in connection with Parents efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such access and examination shall be
conducted during regular business hours and under circumstances that do not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business and shall be
subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The Company shall cause the
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent
and Parents Representatives in connection with such access and examination,
and Parent and its Representatives shall cooperate with the Company and its
Representatives and shall use their

 



47  commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the business.
Any disclosure during such investigation by Parent or its Representatives
shall not constitute any enlargement or additional representation or warranty
of the Company beyond those specifically set forth in _Article IV_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access or examination
shall be permitted to the extent that it (i) relates to the negotiation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose
information that in the reasonable judgment and good faith of counsel to the
Company, is subject to attorney-client privilege or may conflict with any
applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, (i) without the written consent of the Company (which may be
withheld in the Companys sole discretion), Parent shall not contact any
customers of the Company or any Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course
of business of Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, and provided that the Company shall
have the right to have a Representative present during any such contact in the
event that it consents to such contact, and (ii) Parent shall have no right
to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or
facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld for any reason).

Section 6.6 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing is
not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt
Financing has not been obtained, Parent shall continue to be obligated, until
such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ , to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms
contemplated hereby.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing prior to the
Outside Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent in obtaining the Debt Financing, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions described
in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any applicable
"flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter) prior to the Closing Date or
on other terms note materially less beneficial to BPC (including with respect
to the conditionality thereof) and (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing (including by taking enforcement actions against the
lenders and other persons providing the financing (which may include seeking
specific performance against such lenders and persons)). Parent shall not
agree to or permit BPC to agree to (x) any amendment, replacement, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
in each case, without the Companys prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably 

 



48  withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to correct typographical errors,
provide for the assignment of a portion of the Debt Commitment Letter to
additional agents or arrangers or to reallocate commitments or assign or
reassign titles or roles to, or between or among, any entities party thereto
or (y) the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Upon any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with this _Section 6.6_, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall
mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified.

 

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter for any reason, Parent shall use, or cause BPC to use, its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing
from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which
would not involve terms that are materially less beneficial to Parent, would
not involve any conditions to funding the Debt Financing that are not
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The obligations under this
_Section 6.6_ shall apply equally to any such Alternative Financing
(including any new financing commitment).

 

(d) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
(or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.6_) and
provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing
(or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.6_)
including any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
thereto. Parent shall allow the Company to reasonably consult with the
providers of the Debt Financing on the status of such financing ( _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent shall have the right to have one or more
representatives present during any such consultation) and provide the Company,
upon reasonable request, with such information and documentation as shall
be reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to such breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination)
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter (or commitments for any
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.6_) or
definitive documents relating to the Debt Financing of which Parent becomes
aware or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter (or commitments for
any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.6_) or
(ii) if for any reason Parent believes in good faith that there is a
possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing.

 



49 Section 6.7 _Financing Assistance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective
officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and/or Merger Sub, at
Parents sole expense, such reasonable cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in
accordance with this _Section 6.6_) as is necessary and customary and
reasonably requested by Parent and required in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
_Section 6.6_), including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) upon
reasonable notice, participation by senior management, Representatives and
advisors of the Company in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders
and debt investors, in each case, at reasonable times and locations mutually
agreed; (ii) assist with the preparation of materials for bank information
memoranda and private placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda
and other customary marketing materials and information reasonably necessary
in connection with the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in
accordance with this _Section 6.6_); (iii) furnish Parent or Merger Sub and
its financing sources reasonably promptly with the Financing Information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iv) deliver to Parent and its Debt
Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable (i) the documentation
and other information requested by the Debt Financing Sources with respect to
(x) applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and (y) the U.S. Treasury Departments
Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and,
in any event, at least four Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to the
extent requested at least nine days prior to the Closing Date); (v) cause its
independent auditors to cooperate with the Debt Financing consistent with
their customary practice, including by providing customary "comfort letters"
(including customary "negative assurances") and customary consents to the
inclusion of audit reports in any relevant marketing materials,
registration statements and related government filings where financial
information of the Company is included; (vi) assist Parent with Parents
preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial
statements and other materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, offering or private placement memoranda, financial
projections and similar documents used in connection with the Debt Financing;
(vii) execute and deliver definitive Debt Financing documents, including
pledge and security documents, certificates and other documents, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing (
_provided_ , that any obligations contained in such documents shall
be effective no earlier than as of the Closing); and (viii) otherwise
reasonably facilitate the pledging of collateral; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing
(including the entry into any Contract or the encumbrance of any asset of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), that would be effective prior to the Closing
Date or that would otherwise result in a breach of any of its or their
Contracts; _provided_ , _further_ , that the board of directors and officers
of the Company and the board of directors or similar governing body and
officers of its Subsidiaries shall not be required, prior to the Closing, to
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and

 



50  instruments in connection with the Debt Financing or pursuant to which any
portion of the Debt Financing is obtained, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries or any officer or director thereof shall be required to
execute, prior to the Closing, any documents contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
that is effective prior to the Closing or agree to any change or modification
to any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is
effective prior to the Closing.

(b) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of all of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between the Company and
Parent (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates
may share customary projections with respect to the Company and its business
with the Debt Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and
that Parent, its Affiliates and such Debt Financing Sources may share such
information with potential Debt Financing Sources in connection with any
marketing efforts in connection with the Debt Financing, provided that the
recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements. Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section
6.7(a)_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any action that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to
bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur
any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity, guarantee or
pledge in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the foregoing prior to
the Closing Date.

(c) Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including (A)
reasonable outside attorneys fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Companys
accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the Debt Financing,
including performing additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering
documents, participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) to
the extent incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.7_, (ii) acknowledges
and agrees that, except for obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
from and after the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any
liability to any Person under, any arrangement with respect to the Debt
Financing that Parent may request in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or their cooperation and assistance
obligations (including any of the actions taken in accordance with _Section
6.7(a)_) and any information used in connection therewith (other than
historical information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 



51 Section 6.8 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as
promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each party hereto shall furnish to the other
parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Without
limiting the foregoing, upon the request of Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub with respect to any notification to, or
consultation with, any Person (including any works council) representing one
or more groups of employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another and use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including
furnishing all information required under the Competition Laws to effect
promptly all necessary filings with any Governmental Entity and to obtain all
consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder. Each party hereto shall
provide to the other parties copies of all correspondence between it (or
its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Entity or other Governmental
Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the matters described in this _Section 6.8_. Each of the parties hereto shall
promptly inform the other of any substantive oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or conference call with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conference call and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend or participate. To the extent permissible under
applicable Law, and following the execution of a mutually-acceptable joint
defense agreement between the Parent and the Company, the parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the Competition Laws. The parties hereto may, as they deem
advisable, subject to the terms of the aforementioned joint defense agreement,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this _Section 6.8(b)_ or any other section of this Agreement as "legal
counsel only." Subject to the terms of the aforementioned joint defense
agreement, such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
legal counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide or cause to be provided (including by their "ultimate parent entities"
as that term is defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable to any
Governmental Antitrust Entity information and documents requested by such
Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
filing any notification and report form and related material required under
the HSR Act and any other

 



52  filing under any Competition Law set forth on Section 6.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10
Business Days after the date hereof, and thereafter to respond promptly to
any request for additional information or documentary material that may be
made under the HSR Act and any similar Competition Law regarding
preacquisition notifications for the purpose of competition reviews. Parent
shall cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent entity" as that term is
defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings made by it under the HSR Act to
be considered for grant of "early termination," and make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable in connection
therewith. Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees applicable to
Parent and its ultimate parent entity under the HSR Act and under any such
other Laws or regulations applicable to Parent as well as all fees and
expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in responding to any requests for
additional information.

 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted
by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each of
the parties hereto shall, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, use
its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any action to
prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions
contemplated herein); and (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to
overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or
enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated
hereby), including by defending any Action brought by any Governmental Entity
in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated,
including by appeal if necessary, in order to resolve any such objections or
challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such
transactions under such applicable Law so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to obtain any authorization, consent
or approval of a Governmental Entity (including in connection with any filings
or registrations with, or notifications to, any Governmental
Entity) necessary or advisable so as to enable the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event, no later than the Outside Date) and to resolve, avoid or
eliminate any impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Competition Law,
including: (i) taking such actions and agreeing to such requirements or
conditions to mitigate any concerns as may be requested or required by a
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings or registrations with,
notifications to or authorizations, consents or approvals of, any Governmental
Entity; (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), (iii) terminating or
restructuring existing relationships, contractual or governance rights or
obligations of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries), (iv) terminating any venture or other arrangement and
(v) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parents or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporations
and its Subsidiaries), freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or control, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent and its Affiliates

 



53  (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), in each case as
may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and in that regard Parent shall and, shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) to, agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to Parents or its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporations and its Subsidiaries), ability to retain or control, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

(f) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
any equity in, or by any other manner, any assets or Person, if the execution
and delivery of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of,
such acquisition could: (i) impose any delay in obtaining, or increase the
risk of not obtaining, consents of a Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of a
Governmental Entity seeking or entering a Governmental Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such Governmental Order on appeal or
otherwise, or (iv) otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.9 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
Company Benefit Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary
of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer, director,
manager, agent, employee or fiduciary of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
" _Indemnified Individuals_ ") against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the
fact that the Indemnified Individual is or was an officer, director, manager,
agent, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement and the other transactions and actions contemplated hereby),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Individual
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within 10 Business Days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified
Individual of a request therefor, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or

 



54  claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Individual hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Individual from all liability
arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Individual otherwise consents and (z) the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent governing
documents) of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
managers and officers than are set forth in the organizational documents of
the Company (or equivalent governing documents) as of the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) Parent shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, with reputable and financially sound carriers of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous than the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events that
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend, for the entire tail policy, in
excess of 175% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for their current policy of directors and officers
liability insurance. Parent agrees to take all necessary actions to maintain
such policies in full force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder
throughout such six-year period following the Effective Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Individual on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.9_
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Individual is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.9_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
6.9_.

 



55 Section 6.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist
and cooperate with the other party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including: (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties; (b) the obtaining of applicable consents,
waivers or approvals of any Governmental Entities or third parties; (c) the
defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the
obligations hereby; and (d) the execution and delivery of such instruments,
and the taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates
shall be obligated to make any payments or otherwise pay any consideration to
any third party to obtain any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

 

Section 6.11 _Termination of Transaction and Advisory Fee Agreement_. In
connection with the Closing, the Company shall take such actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Transaction and Advisory Fee Agreement with no
further obligations of the Company or its Affiliates from and after the
Closing (other than Section 6 and Section 9 thereof).

 

Section 6.12 _Preservation of Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating
to the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period
of seven years following the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable
Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate
personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice,
to the Securityholder Representative or any Equity Holder as may be reasonably
required by such party in connection with any insurance claims by,
legal proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, or
compliance with applicable Laws by, the Securityholder Representative, the
Equity Holders or any of their Affiliates.

 

Section 6.13 _Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement_. At the Closing,
each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall duly execute and
deliver to the other, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Escrow Agent and Paying Agent to duly execute and deliver to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, respectively.

Section 6.14 _Limited Guarantees_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, comply with any obligation under the SPA (as defined in the

indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantors (as defined in the Limited

payable in connection with the Limited Guarantees to any beneficiary of or
counterparty thereto; and (ii) amounts otherwise incurred as a result of such
Limited Guarantees being accessed, drawn upon or required to be performed.

 

(c) Prior to the Fund Termination Date (as defined in the Limited Guarantees),
if the Limited Guarantees have not previously terminated in accordance with
their terms, Parent shall take the actions specified in the applicable
sections of the Limited Guarantees to terminate the Limited Guarantees.

reasonable efforts to cause the consummation of the purchase of equipment

(ii) the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor Parent shall have the

cured within the earlier of (x) 10 Business Days after the giving of written
notice by Parent to the Company and (y) five Business Days prior to the

validly terminated in accordance with  _Section 8.1_, then each of the
parties shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this
Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination shall be

Section 10.9 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. No reference to or disclosure of

disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. No reference in the Company

items or matters to such other Section or subsection of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent. The bold-faced headings contained in the Company

Disclosure Schedule or to expand, modify or influence the scope of the
information required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



65 Section 10.10 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by
the Company (with the consent of the Securityholder Representative) and
Parent. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any
party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, this _Section 10.10_,  _Section 10.2_, _Section
10.3_, _Section 10.12_ (as it relates to third-party beneficiaries) and
_Section 10.17_ may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise
modified in a manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources, without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 10.11  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

Section 10.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns except
(a) as set forth in _Section 6.9_,  _Section 10.15_, and _Section 10.16_,
(b) for the right of the Company on behalf of the Equity Holders to pursue
damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic benefits
of the Merger, including  _Article III_ , to the Equity Holders) in the event
the Effective Time has not occurred as a result of Parents or Merger Subs
breach of this Agreement (whether or not this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to  _Section 8.1_), (c) after the Effective Time, if Parent shall
not have made payments in accordance with _Article III_ , the right of each
Equity Holder to enforce directly its right to receive the amounts payable
pursuant to  _Article III_ or (d) that the Guarantors (as defined in the
Limited Guarantee) are express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement,
each of which rights set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) hereof are
hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub, nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement. The Debt Financing Sources shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.12_, _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_,
_Section 10.10_ and  _Section 10.17_, each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing
Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such
Sections.

 

Section 10.13 _Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent

 



66  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity and shall waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the
party seeking the injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
has an adequate remedy of Law. The remedies available to the Company pursuant
to this _Section 10.13_ shall be in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity, and the election to pursue an
injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit the Company from seeking to obtain such other remedies.

 

Section 10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof.

 

Section 10.15 _Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) Pursuant to the adoption of this Agreement by Equity Holders representing
greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, each
Equity Holder will be deemed to have irrevocably appointed, authorized and
empowered the Securityholder Representative to act as a representative for the
benefit of each Equity Holder as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact with
the power and authority to act on behalf of each Equity Holder in connection
with and to facilitate the consummation of the Merger, which shall
include the power and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the
Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable, including any amendments or modifications to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements;

(ii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Equity Holders
and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Securityholder
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the other
agreements contemplated hereby and thereby or the Merger and other
transactions provided for herein or therein, and to take any and all actions
which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements for and on behalf of
the Equity Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Securityholder Representative may (A) assert any claim or institute any
Action, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action initiated by
Parent or any other Person, or by any Governmental Entity against the
Securityholder Representative or any of the Equity Holders, (C) receive
process on behalf of any or all Equity Holders in any such Action
and compromise or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be
appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any
such Action, (D) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may deem
advisable or necessary and (E) file and

 



67  prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such
Action (it being understood that the Securityholder Representative shall not
have any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any
liability for any failure to take any such actions);

(iii) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Equity Holders, arising out
of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the other documents
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on
the part of the Securityholder Representative, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, shall be deemed a
waiver of any such right or interest by the Securityholder Representative or
by the Equity Holders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving
party or by the Securityholder Representative;

(iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Securityholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, and all other agreements, documents or instruments
referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and
therewith;

 

(v) to terminate this Agreement if the Company is entitled to do so;

 

(vi) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
including service of process in connection with any arbitration;

 

(vii) to determine whether to deliver a Notice of Disagreement and to resolve
any disputes regarding the Closing Statement; and

(viii) to make or receive any payments or to pay any expenses under or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or on
behalf of the Equity Holders, including by using the Escrow Funds (and any
interest or earnings thereon) to satisfy costs, expenses and/or liabilities of
the Securityholder Representative in connection with matters related to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, with any balance of the Escrow
Funds not used for such purposes to be disbursed and paid, at such time as the
Securityholder Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that
no additional such costs, expenses or liabilities shall become due and
payable, to the Equity Holders in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_ and
_Section 3.6(e)._

 

(b) Parent may rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Equity Holders.

 



68 (c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equity Holder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and by
the other Transaction Agreements.

(d) All actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall be binding upon all
Equity Holders and their respective successors and assigns as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Parent shall serve notice
to, and deal exclusively with, the Securityholder Representative with respect
to any and all matters concerning any of the Equity Holders arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements and all other
agreements or instruments contemplated hereby or thereby or the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document purported by the Securityholder Representative to have been executed
by or on behalf of any of the Equity Holders as fully binding upon them. If
the Securityholder Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to exist or
otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the
Equity Holders, the Equity Holders shall, within 10 days after the occurrence
of such event, appoint (by majority vote or consent of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock) a successor representative and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify the Equity Holders of the identity of such successor. Any such
successor shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the Securityholder
Representative as representative of the Equity Holders hereunder. If for any
reason there is no Securityholder Representative at any time, all references
herein or in any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby to the
Securityholder Representative in which the Securityholder Representative is
authorized to act on behalf of the Equity Holders shall be deemed to refer
to the Equity Holders. Each Equity Holder upon the execution of a Letter of
Transmittal, agrees that any action taken by the Securityholder Representative
on its behalf pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby and
thereby shall be fully binding on them.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representatives
obligations under this _Section 10.15_ are solely as a representative of the
Equity Holders and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by it in such capacity.

Section 10.16 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith (other than the Letters of Transmittal), by its acceptance
of the benefits of this Agreement, Parent covenants, agrees and acknowledges
that no Persons other than the Company have any liabilities, obligations,
commitments (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or otherwise)
hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the Equity Holders of the Company or
their respective managing members or general partners may be partnerships or
limited liability companies, Parent has no right of recovery under this
Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities, obligations, commitments
against, and no personal liability shall attach to, the former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers or general or limited partners of any of
the Company or any former, current

 



69  or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee,
general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or agent of any of the
foregoing (collectively, but not including the Company, each a " _Non-
Recourse Party_ "), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise.

 

Section 10.17 _Debt Financing Sources Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members, stockholders or Representatives shall not have any rights
or claims against any Debt Financing Source, in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (whether directly or by or through a claim by or on behalf of the
Parent against any Debt Financing Source) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, (b) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members, stockholders or Representatives for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or the Debt Financing or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents partners, managers, members, stockholders and
Representatives agree not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or
otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any Action against any Debt Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 10.18 _Representation_. Parent agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each of Merger Sub and their respective directors, officers,
managers, employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP may serve as counsel to the Equity Holders and their
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
contemplated transactions, including any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the contemplated transactions
notwithstanding any representation by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP prior to
the Closing Date of the Company. Parent and the Company hereby (a) waive any
claim they have or may have that Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP has a conflict
of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation
and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Parent and any of the Equity Holders or any of their respective
Affiliates, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP may represent the Equity Holders
or any of their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent or the Company
and even though Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Parent and the
Company also further agree that, as to all

 



70  communications prior to Closing among Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and the
Company, the Equity Holders or the Equity Holders Affiliates and
Representatives, that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated
hereby, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
belongs to the Equity Holders and may be controlled by the Equity Holders and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Company and
a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Securityholder Representative.
