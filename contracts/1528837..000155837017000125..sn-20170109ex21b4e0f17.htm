 \t\t\t2.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller at Closing, and Seller
agrees to sell, assign and deliver to Buyer at Closing, the Assets for the
consideration specified in this ARTICLE 2. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.2 Purchase Price. The unadjusted purchase price for the
Assets shall be $181,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall
be payable as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On the date that this Agreement is fully executed by all
Parties, Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Seller's designated account, an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "Performance
Deposit"). The Performance Deposit shall be held by Seller in accordance with
this Agreement in order to secure Buyer's performance of this Agreement.
Subject to Section 11.2(b) and Section 11.2(c), all interest earned on the
Performance Deposit shall be retained by Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t\t-14-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) After Closing, final adjustments to the Purchase Price shall
be made (1) pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement to be delivered
pursuant to Section 13.1(a) and the payments made by the owing Party as
provided in Section 13.1(a), and (2) upon final resolution of any Title
Disputed Matters and any Environmental Disputed Matters, in accordance with
ARTICLE 4 and ARTICLE 5, respectively. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.3 Allocation of the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Solely for the purposes of ARTICLE 4 and ARTICLE 5, Buyer
and Seller have agreed upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among (1) the
Leases as set forth as part of Exhibit A and (2) the Wells as set forth as
part of Exhibit B (collectively, the "Allocated Values"). Buyer and Seller
make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such Allocated
Values. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If requested by Seller, Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare an allocation of the Final Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to ARTICLE 13, on a Schedule (the "Proposed Section 1060
Allocation Schedule") for purposes of, and in accordance with, Section 1060 of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, within 30 days after the
Final Settlement Date. Within 60 days after delivery of such Proposed Section
1060 Allocation Schedule, if so prepared by Buyer in accordance with the
preceding sentence, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably endeavor to agree to a
final allocation Schedule to be used for income Tax reporting purposes (the
"Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule"); provided that if Buyer and Seller
are unable to reach agreement within such 60-day period, then, immediately
after the expiration of such period, either such Party may invoke the Dispute
resolution provisions immediately below upon the delivery of written notice
thereof to the other Party and, within ten days thereafter, Buyer and Seller
shall mutually appoint an independent expert having the qualifications
specified below (the "Property Valuation Expert"), failing which Buyer and
Seller shall, within ten days after the expiration of such foregoing ten day
period, request (and either such Party may so request alone if the other Party
refuses to jointly act in good faith to do so during such ten day period) that
the AAA, acting through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Property
Valuation Expert. The Property Valuation Expert shall be a licensed petroleum
engineer, having a minimum of ten years' experience with regard to the types
of oil and assets involved in the Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule
Dispute, shall be without any conflicts of interest as to Buyer and Seller,
and shall not have been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work,
in the aggregate, for any Party (including its Affiliates) within the five
year period preceding the submission of the Dispute. Within 15 days following
the appointment of the Property Valuation Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall
provide the Property Valuation Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each
such Party shall provide, both to the Property Valuation Expert and to each
other, a summary of its position with regard to the Proposed Section 1060
Allocation Schedule in a written document of ten pages or less. Buyer and
Seller shall instruct the Property Valuation Expert that, within 30 days after
receiving the last of Buyer and Seller's respective submissions or the
expiration of such 15 day period if either such Party fails to make a
submission, the Property Valuation Expert shall render a written decision,
choosing only either Buyer's position or Seller's position with respect to
each Disputed matter. Any decision rendered by the Property Valuation Expert
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer,
and will be enforceable against each such Party in any court having
jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either or both such Parties, but is not
reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud.
Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-half of the costs of the Property  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-15-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tValuation Expert and of the associated Dispute resolution process and
proceedings, except Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own legal fees with
respect to any Dispute. In the case of such a Dispute resolution process
regarding Buyer's Proposed Section 1060 Allocation Schedule Dispute, Buyer
will issue the Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule consistent with the
Property Valuation Expert's decision, within 30 days after receiving the
Property Valuation Expert's decision with respect thereto. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Property Valuation Expert will function as an expert in
accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as an arbitrator. Seller and
Buyer shall file all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form
8594) consistent with any such Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. Seller
and Buyer shall take no position inconsistent with such allocations on any
applicable Tax Return in any audit by or proceeding before any Governmental
Entity related to Taxes, unless required by Law or with the written consent of
the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or
Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Entity based upon or arising out of the allocation, and neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Governmental Entity challenging such allocation. In the
event that the allocation described herein is disputed by any Governmental
Entity, then the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify,
consult with and obtain the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of the other Party concerning resolution of the
dispute. If a Final Section 1060 Allocation Schedule is not agreed by Buyer
and Seller (or otherwise determined by a Dispute resolution process in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(b)), then each
such Party shall be responsible for its reporting requirements under Code
Section 1060 and any other provisions that may apply; provided that Buyer and
Seller shall reasonably coordinate with each other regarding any such filings,
in order to avoid any material inconsistencies.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.4 Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted according to this Section 2.4 without duplication. For purposes of
determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for
in Section 2.4, and otherwise making the allocations described below, the
principles set forth in Section 2.4(a) shall apply.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Proration of Costs and Revenues.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) Buyer shall be (A) entitled to (i) all production of
Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Properties from and after the
Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and (ii)

related to those Assets operated by Seller or its Affiliates that are earned
prior to Closing, all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with

(and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) "Earned" and "incurred", as used in this Agreement shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants
Society standards, except as otherwise specified herein.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) For purposes of allocating production (and proceeds and
accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.4, (A) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties
when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities
into which they are run and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be
"from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass through the royalty
measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody transfer meters on
the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are transported (whichever
meter is closest to the well). Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative
procedures, consistent with industry practice, to arrive at an allocation of
production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data are not
available.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Property Expenses. The term "Property Expenses" means all
(1) capital expenses attributable to the Assets in the ordinary course of
business, (2) Asset Taxes (as apportioned as of the Effective Time pursuant to
ARTICLE 9), (3) operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development,
operation and production of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and,
where applicable, in accordance with any relevant joint operating agreement
(including lease rentals), and (4) extension and renewal payments with respect
to the Leases, but excluding (in all cases) costs and expenses attributable to
(A) obligations to pay an owner of any working interest, royalty, overriding
royalty, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by
production any revenues or proceeds attributable to sales of Hydrocarbons
relating to the Assets, including those held in suspense, (B) Losses for
personal injury or death, property damage or loss (other than damage to
structures, fences, irrigation systems and other fixtures, crops, livestock

of Contract (other than failure to make payments due under the terms of a
Contract) or violation of any Lease or Law (or private rights of action under
any Law), (C) obligations to plug wells (including the Wells), dismantle or
decommission facilities, close pits and restore the surface around such wells,
facilities and pits, (D) Environmental Liabilities, including obligations to
remediate any contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil, sediments or

respect to Imbalances, (F) Overhead Costs and (G) claims for indemnification
or reimbursement from any Third Party with respect to costs of the type
described in preceding clauses (A) through (F), whether such claims are made
pursuant to Contract or otherwise.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Upward Adjustments. To calculate the Preliminary Purchase
Price and the Final Purchase Price, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
upward, without duplication, by the following:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) an amount equal to any proceeds received by Buyer (net of
royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests and other similar
burdens on or measured by production and Asset Taxes) from the sale of any
Hydrocarbons that were produced and saved from, or attributable to, the Assets

 \t\t\t(3) an amount equal to the value of all Hydrocarbons that were
produced and saved from, or attributable to, the Assets that are in storage or
existing in stock tanks, pipelines and/or plants (including inventory) as of

market price in effect as of the Effective Time in the field in which such
Hydrocarbons were produced), net of (A) all amounts payable as royalties,
overriding royalties, net profit interests and other similar burdens on or
measured by production and (B) all applicable Asset Taxes; \t\t

Lease which expires pursuant to its own terms shall not be considered to be
abandoned for purposes of this Section 2.4(d)(3); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) an amount equal to all proceeds received by Seller or its
Affiliates (net of royalties, overriding royalties, net profit interests and

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 3 
BUYER'S INSPECTION; DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1 Due Diligence. Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 3,
from and after the execution of this Agreement up to the Defect Notice Date
(the "Due Diligence Period"), Seller will make the Assets available to Buyer
and its Representatives for inspection and review to permit Buyer, at Buyer's
sole cost, to perform its due diligence with respect to the Assets ("Due
Diligence Review").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.2 Access to Records. For purposes of the Due Diligence
Review, Seller consents to, and agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate, Buyer's discussions with Third Parties in connection
with its Due Diligence Review (provided that a representative of Seller is
present for any such discussions, unless Seller has consented in writing to be
absent from such discussion), and will upon reasonable (being no less than one
Business Days') advance notice from Buyer, make the Records available to Buyer
for inspection or copying and shall provide a reasonable means of copying to
Buyer at Seller's offices, in each case, at Buyer's sole cost and expense at
the offices of Seller during normal business hours.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.3 On-Site Inspection. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Seller hereby consents to Buyer conducting, during the Due
Diligence Period and for purposes of the Due Diligence Review, upon reasonable
(being no less than three Business Days') advance notice to Seller and at
Buyer's sole risk and expense, on-site inspections of the Assets and a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, (each such inspection or assessment, an
"Environmental Assessment"); provided, however, that if the consent of any
Third Party is required to provide Buyer such access, and such consent is not
granted following the commercially reasonable efforts of Seller, Buyer shall
not have access to such affected Assets. Should any such Third Party not grant
such access following the commercially reasonable efforts of Seller, Buyer
shall have the right, at its sole discretion, upon delivery of written notice
to Seller on or before three Business Days prior to Closing, to exclude the
Assets to which it was unable to receive access from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in which case the Purchase Price shall be
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-20-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\treduced by the Allocated Value of such Assets and such Assets shall
become Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. Buyer shall not conduct
any sampling, boring or other invasive activities without prior written notice
to, and the written consent of, Seller. Further, Buyer's right of inspection
shall not entitle Buyer to operate equipment. In the event that the Buyer
conducts a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and the written report
prepared by a third party environmental consultant in connection with the
assessment recommends a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (as defined in
the applicable ASTM International Standards) with respect to a an Asset, the
Buyer may submit a written request to Seller that the Buyer be allowed to
conduct a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment on such affected Asset. If
Seller does not give its consent for a Phase II Environmental Assessment
pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence, then (A) Buyer shall have the
right, at its sole discretion, upon delivery of written notice to Seller on or
before three Business Days prior to Closing, to exclude such Asset from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset if it is so excluded, and (C)
such Asset shall become an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. In
connection with any Environmental Assessment or other inspection pursuant to
this Section 3.3, Buyer agrees to comply with all safety policies and other
requirements of Seller and the operator of the Assets (whether such operator
is Seller, an Affiliate of Seller or a Third Party). Buyer shall coordinate
its access rights and Environmental Assessments of the Assets with Seller and
any Third Party operator of the Assets to reasonably minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Seller or any
such Third Party operator of the Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If Buyer or any of its Representatives, prepares a final
written report with respect to any Environmental Assessment, Buyer will
furnish a copy thereof to Seller as soon as practicable following the receipt
thereof by Buyer, and in any event by the Defect Notice Date. Within five
Business Days following the Execution Date, Seller shall make available to
Buyer and allow Buyer to copy at Buyer's expense all Records that constitute
environmental reports and records generated by Seller, its Affiliates, its
predecessors, and its or their consultants (in each case to the extent in the
possession of Seller or its Affiliates) and Seller shall allow Buyer to
discuss such reports with such consultants. Except (1) as may be required or
permitted pursuant to the exercise of the rights and fulfillment of the
obligation of a Party under this Agreement, including in connection with the
resolution of any Environmental Disputed Matter pursuant to Section 5.3(f),
(2) as may be required by applicable Law, (3) for information which is or
becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Person against whom this
sentence is sought to be enforced, or (4) as may be required by a Party in
order to defend or prosecute any Claim related to the Assets, the Parties
shall maintain the confidentiality of any Environmental Assessments conducted
hereunder, and any reports created with respect thereto, unless and only to
the extent disclosure of the same is required by a Governmental Entity.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) During all times during the Due Diligence Period that Buyer
and/or any of its Representatives are on the Assets or conducting Buyer's Due
Diligence Review of the Records, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and
with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the
types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Seller. Coverage under all
insurance required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (1) be primary
insurance, (2) list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (3)
waive subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties and (4) provide for
five days prior notice to Seller in the event of cancellation  \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-21-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tor modification of the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon request
by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to
entering the Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES,
RELEASES AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER AND THE
OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES ARISING
IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACCESS AFFORDED TO BUYER AND ITS
REPRESENTATIVES PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 3 OR THE ACTIVITIES (OR ACTS OF
OMISSION) OF BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES RELATED TO SUCH ACCESS, INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (BUT FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT
NOT INCLUDING LOSSES (SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT) RELATING TO
THE MERE DISCOVERY OF ANY CONDITION AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACCESS ACTIVITIES OR
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT), IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR
ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT
OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW
OF OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Upon completion of any Environmental Assessment, Buyer
shall, at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller
or its Affiliates (1) repair all physical damage done to the Assets or to the
Environment in connection with Buyer's Environmental Assessment, (2) restore
the Assets to the approximate same or better physical condition than it was
prior to commencement of Buyer's Environmental Assessment (if any such
restoration is necessary as a result of Buyer's Environmental Assessment) and
(3) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto, and any wastes
generated on, the Assets in connection with Buyer's Environmental Assessment.
Any disturbance to the Assets (including the real property associated with the
Assets) resulting from Buyer's Environmental Assessment will be promptly
corrected by Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 3.3, subject
to Section 5.3(e), prior to Closing, Buyer shall not be responsible for curing
or Remediating any Condition existing at or on the Assets. Buyer shall be
solely responsible for properly disposing of any drilling, soils or other
material generated or removed from the Assets in connection with its
Environmental Assessment or any invasive activity conducted by Buyer or its
Representatives on the Assets, including all costs related thereto; provided,
however, that, prior to Closing, Buyer will not be obligated to execute any
documents identifying Buyer as the owner or generator of these materials,
which status will continue to be held by the owner of the Assets. \t\t

not operate to: (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target
Formation throughout the productive life of any Lease or Well below the Net
Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, with
respect to the Target Formation for such Lease or Well (unless the Working

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(7) the terms and conditions of the Leases or of any compulsory

such items does not: (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the
Target Formation throughout the productive life of any Lease or Well below the
Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, with
respect to the Target Formation for such Lease or Well (unless the Working

respect to the Target Formation throughout the productive life of such Lease
or Well (unless the Working Interest with respect to the Target Formation

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2 Title Defects and Title Benefits. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Title Defect. The term "Title Defect" means any Lien,
obligation, defect, or other matter that causes Seller not to have Defensible
Title to any Property, provided, however, that none of the following shall be
considered Title Defects: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to
recite marital status in a document, unless Buyer provides affirmative
evidence that such failure could reasonably be expected to result in another
Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Assets; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) unless required by applicable Law, defects arising out of
lack of survey or lack of metes and bounds description; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) defects asserting a change in Working Interest or Net
Revenue Interest based on a change in drilling and spacing units, tract
allocation or other changes in pool or unit participation occurring after the
Effective Time by a Person other than Seller; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity
authorization, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure
could reasonably be expected to result in another Person's superior claim of
title to the relevant Assets;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of
limitations, prescription, laches or otherwise; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6) defects arising as a result of non-consent interests in any
Well not being held of record by Seller; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(7) defects based on a gap in Seller's chain of title in the
State of Texas' records as to any applicable Leases where the State of Texas
or its agent is the lessor thereunder, or in the applicable county records in
the State of Texas as to the other Leases, unless (a) such gap is
affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an abstract of title, title
opinion or landman's title chain or runsheet, which documents shall be
provided with delivery of a Notice of Defective Interest with respect to such
defects, and (b) Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such gap in title
results in another Person's claim of title to the relevant Assets, which
evidence shall be included with such Notice of Defective Interest;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(8) defects as a consequence of cessation of production,
insufficient production, or failure to conduct operations on any of the
Properties held by production, or lands pooled, communitized or unitized
therewith, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that causes Buyer to
reasonably believe the cessation of production, insufficient production or
failure to conduct operations would give rise to a right to terminate the
Lease in question, which evidence shall be provided with delivery of a Notice
of Defective Interest with respect to such defects; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(9) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to
probate proceedings or lack thereof, unless Buyer provides affirmative
evidence that such failure could reasonably be expected to result in another
Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Assets; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(10) defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to
the Lands that are terminated, expired or invalid but not surrendered of
record;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(11) any defect that affects only which Person has the right to
receive royalty payments (rather than the amount of such royalty) and that
does not affect the validity of the underlying Lease; and  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(12) defects based on references to lack of information (unless
such information (A) is not reflected in the records of the applicable county
and (B) is not in the Records made available to Buyer).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-27-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Title Benefit. The term "Title Benefit" means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to (1) increase the Net Revenue
Interest of Seller with respect to the Target Formation in any Lease or Well
above that shown on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, with respect to the
Target Formation for such Lease or Well, to the extent the same does not cause
a greater than proportionate increase in Seller's Working Interest with
respect to the Target Formation for any such Well above that shown on Exhibit
B with respect to the Target Formation for such Well or (2) increase the
number of Target Formation Net Mineral Acres to which Seller is entitled with
respect to the Assets above that shown for each Lease on Exhibit A. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notice of Defective Interest. On or before the Defect
Notice Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Defect (such notice, a "Notice
of Defective Interests"). To be effective, each Notice of Defective Interests
shall be in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear description of the
alleged Title Defect, (2) each Property (and the applicable intervals therein)
affected by the alleged Title Defect (each such Property, a "Title Defect
Property"), (3) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (4)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect, and (5) the amount which Buyer reasonably believes to be the
Title Defect Amount as provided for in Section 4.2(e), and the computations
and information upon which Buyer's beliefs are based; provided, however, that
Buyer's failure to satisfy the conditions in (1) through (5) shall not make a
Notice of Defective Interests ineffective with respect to a Title Defect if
the nature of the Title Defect is reasonably determinable from the Notice of
Defective Interests. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing Title Defects, prior to the Defect Notice Date, Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to give Seller weekly notices of all Title Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding week; provided that any such notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date.
Other than with respect to the "special warranty" contained in the Assignment
and Buyer's remedies for breaches of Section 8.1(b)(1) and Section 8.1(b)(3),
any matters that may otherwise constitute a Title Defect, but of which Seller
has not been notified by Buyer in a Notice of Defective Interests delivered in
accordance with this Section 4.2(c) prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall be
deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notice of Title Benefits. On or prior to the Defect Notice
Date, Buyer will promptly furnish Seller with written notice (in accordance
with the requirements for a Title Benefit Notice below) of any matters that,
in Buyer's reasonable opinion, could constitute a Title Benefit, and that is
discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its Representatives (for the avoidance
of doubt, including any title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners)
while conducting Buyer's Due Diligence Review. On or before the Defect Notice
Date, Seller shall advise Buyer in writing of any matters that, in Seller's
reasonable opinion, constitute a Title Benefit (each such notice, a "Title
Benefit Notice"). Each Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and contain
the following: (1) a clear description of the Title Benefit, (2) each
Property (and the applicable intervals therein) affected by the Title Benefit
(each such Property, a "Title Benefit Property"), (3) the Allocated Value of
each Title Benefit Property, (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Buyer (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Buyer) to verify the
existence of the Title Benefit, and (5) the amount which Seller reasonably
believes to be the Title Benefit Amount for each Title Benefit Property and
the computations and information upon which Seller's belief is based. Subject
to Seller's remedy for a breach of this Section 4.2(d) by Buyer, Seller shall
be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given, or
received, notice on or before the Defect Notice Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-28-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Title Defect Amount. Subject to the provisions of Section
4.2(f), the "Title Defect Amount" means the amount by which the Allocated
Value of a Title Defect Property affected by a Title Defect is reduced as a
result of the existence of such Title Defect, which amount shall be determined
in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) if Buyer and Seller agree in writing on the Title Defect
Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the
payment necessary to remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) if the Title Defect is based on the Seller owning fewer
Target Formation Net Mineral Acres in a Lease than those shown on Exhibit A
for such Lease, then the Title Defect Amount for such Lease shall be
calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value set forth on Exhibit A by a
fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to the number of Target
Formation Net Mineral Acres shown for such Lease on Exhibit A less the actual
Target Formation Net Mineral Acres actually owned for such Lease, and the
denominator of which is the Target Formation Net Mineral Acres shown for such
Lease on Exhibit A;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) in the event that the Title Defect for any Lease or Well is
the actual failure of Seller to own the represented Net Revenue Interest with
respect to the Target Formation for such Lease or Well set forth on Exhibit A
or Exhibit B, as applicable, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, (A)
the numerator of which is the difference between (i) the actual Net Revenue
Interest with respect to the Target Formation for the Title Defect Property,
and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest with respect to the Target Formation for
such Title Defect Property as set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as
applicable, and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest with
respect to the Target Formation for such Title Defect Property as set forth on
Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of
a type not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following
factors: (A) any potential discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue Interest
with respect to the Target Formation or Working Interest with respect to the
Target Formation for such Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue
Interest with respect to the Target Formation or Working Interest with respect
to the Target Formation as stated on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable;
(B) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (C) the portion of the
Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (D) the legal effect of
the Title Defect; (E) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and
Seller; and (F) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Title Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for any Title Defect affecting a  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-29-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tTitle Defect Property for which the Title Defect Amount attributable
thereto does not exceed $50,000 ("Individual Title Threshold") (and if so
exceeded Seller shall, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, be
entitled to the entire Defect Amount from the first dollar for such Title
Defect); and (2) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby for any Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect
affecting a Title Defect Property that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold
unless (A) the sum of (i) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title
Defects exceeding the Individual Title Threshold (i.e., the entire amount of
any such Title Defect Amounts from the first dollar for those Title Defects
which exceed the Individual Title Threshold), excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller, plus (ii) the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of all
Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold
(i.e., the entire amount of any such Environmental Defect Amounts from the
first dollar for those Environmental Defects which exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold), excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated by
Seller, minus (iii) all Title Benefit Amounts (the amount obtained pursuant to
clauses (i) - (iii) above, the "Total Defect Amount"), exceeds (B) the
Aggregate Defect Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the
amount by which the Total Defect Amount exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Deductible. In no event will Buyer be entitled to claim any remedies under
Section 4.2(f), Section 4.2(j), Section 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(e) for any Title
Defects and/or Environmental Defects to the extent any Title Defect Amounts or
Environmental Defect Values attributable thereto, in the aggregate, with
respect to an Asset, exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Title Benefit Amount. The "Title Benefit Amount" means the
amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title Benefit Property affected by a
Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit.
Each Title Benefit Amount shall be determined in accordance with the same
methodology, terms and conditions for determining each Title Defect Amount.
With respect to any Title Benefits reported under Section 4.2(d) and provided
that the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto is in excess of the
Individual Title Threshold (and if so exceeded Seller shall, subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, be entitled to the entire Title Benefit
Amount from the first dollar for such Title Benefit), the Title Benefit Amount
attributable to such Title Benefits shall be used to reduce the amount of the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects and Environmental
Defects properly and timely raised by Buyer after taking into account the
Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental Threshold, as
applicable. If Buyer and Seller cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title
Benefits or Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, then (1) the
average of Seller's and Buyer's good faith estimate of such disputed Title
Benefit Amount shall be used in calculating the reduction to the Title Defect
Amounts and Environmental Defect Values pursuant to this Section 4.2(g) to the
extent applicable, and (2) the provisions of Section 4.3 shall apply. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be entitled to any remedy with respect to
any claimed Title Benefit if the applicable Title Benefit Amount with respect
thereto is not in excess of the Individual Title Threshold. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Title Adjustment Amount. The amount by which the Purchase
Price is to be adjusted in accordance with this ARTICLE 4 for Title Defect
Amounts (after, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any offsetting
Title Benefit Amounts) shall be referred to as the "Title Adjustment
Amount". \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-30-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Seller's Right to Cure. Continuing until four Business Days
prior to Closing (such period of time, the "Pre-Closing Cure Period"), Seller
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to
cure or remove any Title Defects timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section
4.2(c). If Seller believes that it has cured any applicable Title Defect
during the Pre-Closing Cure Period, Seller shall deliver written notice
thereof to Buyer at or prior to the end of the Pre-Closing Cure Period,
together with supporting documents available to Seller and reasonably
necessary for Buyer (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Buyer)
to verify the cure of such Title Defects Seller believes it has cured. Buyer
shall, within five Business Days following Buyer's receipt of written notice
from Seller that it has cured the applicable Title Defect, but in any event,
no later than two Business Days following the end of the Pre-Closing Cure
Period, advise Seller in writing whether it agrees or (pursuant to a Title
Dispute Notice, as described in Section 4.3) Disputes that any such Title
Defect has been so cured; provided that Buyer's failure to timely respond to
Seller's notice of cure shall be deemed Buyer's agreement that such Title
Defect has been cured and Buyer's waiver of its Claim with respect such Title
Defect. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of a Dispute as to Seller's attempted
cure of any Title Defect, then (subject to Section 4.2(j)), the provisions of
Section 4.3 shall apply to such Title Defect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect
Amount asserted with respect thereto and subject to Section 4.2(f), in the
event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with
Section 4.2(c) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured by Seller prior to
the end of the Pre-Closing Cure Period in accordance with Section 4.2(i)
(which cure has not been Disputed by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.2(i)),
then the Seller shall elect one of the following remedies with respect to such
Title Defect, as applicable: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount
applicable to such Title Defect; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) if the Title Defect Amount is equal to of the Allocated
Value of the applicable Title Defect Property, retain the entirety of the
Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect (together with all
related Assets) and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Assets so retained; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) if Buyer agrees (in its sole discretion) in writing, require
Seller to indemnify Buyer against all Losses resulting from such Title Defect
with respect to the applicable Title Defect Property based on the current use
of such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAs to any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with
Section 4.2(c) which is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured by Seller at
Closing (which cure has not been Disputed by Buyer in accordance with Section
4.2(i)), and for which a corresponding Title Defect Amount is included in the
Title Adjustment Amount at Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Title Defect which Seller has chosen to dispute pursuant to Section 4.3),
Seller also shall retain the right, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure
each such Title Defect after Closing at Seller's sole cost and expense;
provided that Seller shall furnish notice to Buyer of Seller's belief that it
has cured any such Title Defect (together with supporting documents available
to Seller and reasonably necessary for Buyer, as well as any title attorney or
examiner hired by it, to verify the cure of any  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-31-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tsuch Title Defect), as soon as practicable after the Closing, but in
no event later 165 days after Closing (such period from Closing to 165 days
after Closing, the "Post-Closing Cure Period"); provided, however, that
Seller's failure to provide notice by the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period
of Seller's asserted cure shall be deemed Seller's waiver of its right to cure
such Title Defect. If Buyer disagrees that the Title Defect has been cured,
it shall so advise Seller in writing within five Business Days after receipt
of Seller's notice as provided above, following which the provisions of
Section 4.3 will apply to resolve such Dispute, and the Final Settlement
Statement Due Date shall be extended to the extent necessary to complete the
Dispute resolution procedure as provided for in Section 4.3. Should Buyer (A)
fail to respond to Seller's notice of cure in such five Business Day period,
then Buyer shall be deemed to have (i) agreed that the Title Defect has been
cured and (ii) waived its Claim with respect to such Title Defect, or (B)
agree that the Title Defect has been cured, then, in each case, the Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto and included in the Title Adjustment Amount
used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be credited to Seller in
the Final Settlement Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.3 Title Dispute Resolution. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve any Title Disputed Matter, then either such Party shall have the
right, upon the delivery of written notice to the other Party (each, a "Title
Dispute Notice"), to Dispute such Title Disputed Matter and to invoke the
Dispute resolution provisions below in this Section 4.3 in order to resolve
any such Dispute. As used herein, the term "Title Disputed Matter" means a
Dispute regarding any of the following: (w) the existence and scope of a Title
Defect or Title Benefit; (x) any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount,
as the case may be; (y) the Title Adjustment Amount, if any; and (z) the
adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative actions. As to any Dispute
regarding the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative actions after Closing
as provided for in Section 4.2(j), the Final Settlement Statement Due Date
shall be extended to the extent necessary to complete the Dispute resolution
procedure as provided for below in this Section 4.3. Any Title Dispute Notice
relating to any of Seller's Title Defect curative actions taken during the
Pre-Closing Cure Period must be delivered within five Business Days following
Buyer's receipt of notice from Seller that it has cured the applicable Title
Defect, but in any event, no later than two Business Days following the end of
the Pre-Closing Cure Period. Any Title Dispute Notice relating to any of
Seller's Title Defect curative actions during the Post-Closing Cure Period
must be delivered within five Business Days following Buyer's receipt of
notice from Seller that it has cured the applicable Title Defect. In no event
will Closing be delayed on account of any Title Disputed Matter and, if the
Title Defect Property affected thereby is transferred to Buyer at Closing, the
average of Buyer and Seller's respective good faith estimates of the Title
Defect Amounts attributable to such Title Defect Property shall be used in the
calculation and determination of the Title Adjustment Amount to be used at
Closing, subject to the Parties' ongoing rights under this Section 4.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve all Title Disputed
Matters through good faith negotiations after the delivery of a Title Dispute
Notice by either such Party. If after 20 days following the end of the Post-
Closing Cure Period there are any Title Disputed Matters remaining in Dispute,
such Title Disputed Matters then shall be resolved pursuant to this Section
4.3 and Buyer and Seller shall mutually appoint an independent expert having
the qualifications specified below (the "Title Defect Expert") within five
business days after the expiration of such 20 day period following the end of
the Post-Closing Cure Period. If Buyer and Seller are unable to mutually agree
upon the Title Defect Expert, then Buyer and Seller shall, within ten days
after the expiration of such negotiation period, request (and either such
Party may so request alone if the  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-32-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tother Party refuses to jointly act in good faith to do so during such
ten day period) that the AAA, acting through its offices in Houston, Texas,
appoint the Title Defect Expert. The Title Defect Expert shall be a licensed
title attorney having a minimum of ten years' experience with regard to the
types of title defects affecting the Properties involved in the Title Disputed
Matter, shall be without any conflicts of interest as to Buyer and Seller, and
shall not have been employed by or undertaken more than $50,000 of work, in
the aggregate, for any Party or its Affiliates within the five year period
preceding the submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Title Defect Expert will function as an expert in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 4.3, not as an arbitrator. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Within 30 days following the appointment of the Title Defect
Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the Title Defect Expert with a copy
of this Agreement, and each such Party shall provide, both to the Title Defect
Expert and each other, a summary of its position with regard to each such
outstanding Title Disputed Matter in a written document of five pages or less
per Title Disputed Matter. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Title Defect
Expert that, within 30 days after receiving Buyer and Seller's respective
submissions, the Title Defect Expert shall render a written decision. In
rendering its decision, the Title Defect Expert shall not award (1) a higher
Title Defect Amount than the lower of (A) the Allocated Value of the
applicable Property or (B) the amount claimed by Buyer in its summary, (2) a
higher Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Seller in its summary,
(3) a lower Title Benefit Amount than the amount claimed by Buyer in its
summary or (4) a lower Title Defect Amount than that amount claimed by Seller
in its summary, as applicable. The Title Defect Expert shall determine the
specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount, Title
Benefit Amount or the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative actions, as
the case may be, submitted by either such Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either such Party with respect to any other matter.
Any decision rendered by the Title Defect Expert pursuant hereto shall be
final, conclusive, and binding on Seller and Buyer, and will be enforceable
against each such Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof or
jurisdiction of either or both such Parties, but is not reviewable by, or
appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud. Buyer and Seller shall
each bear one-half of the costs of the Title Defect Expert and of any
associated dispute resolution process and proceedings, except Buyer and Seller
shall each bear its own legal fees with respect to any Dispute.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect
did not exist or that a Title Defect existed but was cured by Seller, then any
Title Defect Amount attributable thereto that was included in the Title
Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, shall be credited to Seller in the
Final Settlement Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect
exists, but that the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto is a lesser
amount than any Title Defect Amount with respect thereto that was included in
the Title Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, then the difference
thereof shall be credited to Seller in the Final Settlement Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) If the Title Defect Expert determines that a Title Defect
exists, such Title Defect has not been cured by Seller and the Title Defect
Amount attributable thereto is a greater amount than any Title Defect Amount
with respect thereto that was included in the Title Adjustment Amount used at
Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to Buyer in the
Final Settlement Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-33-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price
will be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, if any Asset is retained by Seller
pursuant to Section 4.2(j)(2), the Dispute resolution provisions set forth in
this Section 4.3 will not apply and no conveyance of such Asset will
thereafter be made to Buyer and no payment shall be required of Buyer in
connection with any such Asset so retained. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4 Preferential Rights and Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Preferential Purchase Rights. Promptly following the
Execution Date, and in any event within ten Business Days following the
Execution Date, Seller shall send notices to the holder of each Preferential
Right listed on Schedule 6.6 (if applicable) in accordance with the terms of
the instruments giving rise to such Preferential Rights. Seller shall provide
a copy of each such notice to Buyer following the delivery thereof by Seller.
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause written waivers of
such Preferential Rights to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing;
provided that Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake other
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights
in order to obtain the required waivers. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller in seeking to obtain such waivers of Preferential Rights; provided
that Buyer shall not be required to make payments or undertake other
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such Preferential Rights
in order to obtain the required waivers. Any Preferential Rights must be
exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including all thresholds, deductibles and other amounts except for the cash
consideration, which shall equal the Allocated Value for such Asset),
including the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE 12 as
to those Assets for which Preferential Rights have not been exercised. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of Preferential Rights notices shall be the Allocated Value for such
Asset, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 13.1. If,
prior to the Closing Date, any Party discovers any required Preferential Right
for which notices have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 4.4(a), then (x) the Party making such discovery shall provide
the other Party with written notification of such Preferential Right, (y)
Seller, following delivery or receipt of such written notification, as
applicable, will promptly send notices to the holders of such Preferential
Rights in accordance with the terms of the instrument giving rise to such
Preferential Right, and (z) the terms and conditions of this Section 4.4(a)
shall apply to the Assets subject to such Preferential Right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Assets to
which its Preferential Right applies or if the time for exercising such
Preferential Right has not expired, then the Assets subject to such
Preferential Right (together with all related Assets) shall be excluded from
the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets so excluded.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person
exercising a Preferential Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such
Preferential Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Assets
subject to such Preferential Right (together with all related Assets) on or
before the end of the time period for closing such sale or the time  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-34-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tfor exercising such Preferential Right expires without exercise by the
holder thereof, then (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Seller shall assign
to Buyer, on the tenth Business Day following the end of such time period or
termination of such right without exercise, such Assets that were so excluded
at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the
Assignment, and (C) Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing
with respect to such excluded Assets, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4 and
Section 13.1.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Right has
been waived, or as to which the time for exercising the applicable
Preferential Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be
transferred to Buyer at Closing, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Consents. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, and in any event within ten Business Days following the Execution
Date, Seller shall send notices to the holder of each Consent listed on
Schedule 6.5(a) and Schedule 6.5(b) requesting such holder's applicable
written Consent to the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Consents to be obtained and
delivered prior to Closing; provided that Seller shall not be required to make
payments or undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the holders
of such Consents in order to obtain the required Consents. Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such Consents to
assignment; provided that Buyer shall not be required to make payments or
undertake other obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such
Consents in order to obtain the required Consents. If, prior to the Closing
Date, any Party discovers any Consents for which notices have not been
delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.4(b), then (x) the
Party making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written
notification of such Consents, (y) Seller, following delivery or receipt of
such written notification, as applicable, will promptly send notices to the
holders of Consents requesting such Consents, and (z) the terms and conditions
of this Section 4.4(b) shall apply to the Assets subject to such
Consents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) If (A) Seller fails to obtain any Required Consent prior to
Closing, the Assets affected by such un-obtained Required Consent (together
with all related Assets, the "Affected Assets") shall, unless Buyer and Seller
otherwise agree, be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the sum of the Allocated
Value of such Affected Assets.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) If any such Required Consent relating to Affected Assets
that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within 120 days following
the Closing, then (A) on the fifteenth Business Day after such Required
Consent is obtained, Seller shall assign such Affected Assets to Buyer
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment,
and (B) Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with
respect to such Affected Assets, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4 and
Section 13.1, and as would be further adjusted for such Affected Asset
pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 13.1 or the other terms of this Agreement
as if the Closing had occurred on the date of such assignment such that Buyer
shall receive the benefit of such transferred asset and bear the burden of
such transferred asset from the Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) Except for and excluding (A) Required Consents, (B) Consents
for which the holder thereof has expressly denied or conditioned such Consent
and (C) Consents for which the holder is a Governmental Entity, if Seller
fails to obtain any other Consent prior to Closing and (i) the holder of such
Consent has not expressly denied or conditioned the Consent when requested and
(ii) the holder of such Consent is not a Governmental Entity, then (I) the
Assets subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by
Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets and Seller (for a period of
60 days following Closing) and Buyer shall each use their commercially
reasonable efforts following Closing to obtain such Consent, (II) Buyer shall
have no claim against Seller, and Seller shall have no liability for, the
failure to obtain any such Consent, (III) Buyer shall be responsible from and
after the Closing for any and all Losses arising from the failure to obtain
such Consent, and (IV) any Consents of the kind described in (B) or (C) above
shall be deemed Required Consents for all purposes under this Section
4.4(b). \t\t

of Section 6.15 and subject to Section 14.2(a), Section 5.3 shall constitute
the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of Buyer as against Seller or its
Affiliates with respect to any Environmental Defect, the existence of any

comply with Environmental Laws with respect to the Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3 Environmental Defects. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Environmental Defect Notices. On or before the Defect
Notice Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any matters that, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute an Environmental Defect (such notice,
an "Environmental Defect Notice"). To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear description
of the alleged Environmental Defect, (2) each Asset affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect (each such Asset, an "Environmental Defect Property"),
(3) the Allocated Value, if any, of each Environmental Defect Property, (4)
supporting documents that are in Buyer's or its Representatives' possession,
if any, that are reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any environmental
consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged
Environmental Defect, and (5) the amount that Buyer reasonably believes is the
cost to Remediate each alleged Environmental Defect, net to Seller's interest
in the applicable Assets (the "Environmental Defect Value"), and the
computations and information upon which Buyer's belief is based; provided,
however, that Buyer's failure to satisfy the conditions in (4) and (5) shall
not make an Environmental Defect Notice ineffective with respect to an
Environmental Defect if the nature of the Environmental Defect is reasonably
determinable from the Environmental Defect Notice and the conditions in (1)
through (3) are satisfied in all material respects. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, prior to
the Defect Notice Date Buyer agrees to use its reasonable efforts to give
Seller weekly notices of all Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during
the preceding week; provided that any such notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to or on the Defect Notice Date. Buyer's failure to
provide such weekly notices shall not constitute a waiver of any Environmental
Defect provided an Environmental Defect Notice is delivered to Seller prior to
the Defect Notice Date. Other than with respect to Buyer's remedies for
breaches of Section 6.15, any matters that may otherwise constitute an
Environmental Defect, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer in an
Environmental Defect Notice delivered in accordance with this Section 5.3(a)
prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer
for all purposes.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Environmental Deductibles. Other than with respect to
Buyer's remedies for breaches of Section 6.15, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller in  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-38-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tconnection with the transactions contemplated hereby for any
Environmental Defect affecting an Environmental Defect Property for which the
Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto does not exceed $100,000
("Individual Environmental Threshold") (and if so exceeded Seller shall,
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, be entitled to the entire
Defect Amount from the first dollar for such Environmental Defect); and (2) in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby for any Environmental Defect Value attributable to an Environmental
Defect affecting an Environmental Defect Property that exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless the Total Defect Amount exceeds the Aggregate
Defect Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the amount by which
the Total Defect Amount exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible. If any Asset
is excluded pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(3), any Environmental Defect Value
relating to such excluded Asset will not be counted towards the Aggregate
Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in no event will Buyer be entitled to claim any remedies under
Section 4.2(f), Section 4.2(j), Section 5.3(b), Section 5.3(e) or for any
Title Defects, Environmental Defects and/or claims" to the extent any Title
Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Value in the aggregate (A) exceed the
Total Defect Amount minus the Aggregate Defect Deductible or (B) with respect
to an Asset, exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset. If any Asset is
excluded pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(3), any Environmental Defect Value
relating to such excluded Asset will not be counted towards the Aggregate
Defect Deductible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Environmental Adjustment Amount. The amount by which the
Purchase Price is to be adjusted in accordance with this ARTICLE 5 for
Environmental Defect Values shall be referred to as the "Environmental
Adjustment Amount". \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Seller's Right to Remediate. Continuing until the end of
the Pre-Closing Cure Period, Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to Remediate any Environmental
Defects timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.3(a). If Seller
believes that it has Remediated any applicable Environmental Defect, Seller
shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyer at or prior to the end of the
Pre-Closing Cure Period, together with supporting documents available to
Seller and reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as any environmental
consultant hired by Buyer) to verify the Remediation of the Environmental
Defects. Buyer shall, within two Business Days following the end of the Pre-
Closing Cure Period, advise Seller in writing whether it agrees or (pursuant
to an Environmental Dispute Notice, as described in Section 5.3(f)) Disputes
that the Environmental Defect has been so Remediated; provided that Buyer's
failure to timely respond to Seller's notice of Remediation shall be deemed
Buyer's agreement that the Environmental Defect has been Remediated and
Buyer's waiver of its Claim with respect to such Environmental Defect. If
Buyer timely notifies Seller of a Dispute as to Seller's attempted Remediation
of any Environmental Defect or is deemed to reject such claim through its
failure to timely respond, then (subject to Section 5.3(e)) the provisions of
Section 5.3(f) shall apply to such Environmental Defect.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's
continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or
the Environmental Defect Value asserted with respect thereto and subject to
Section 5.3(b), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by
Buyer in accordance with Section 5.3(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-39-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tRemediated by Seller prior to the end of the Pre-Closing Cure Period
in accordance with Section 5.3(d), then Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree
in writing to elect one of the following remedies with respect to such
Environmental Defect: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value
applicable to such Environmental Defect; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) require Seller to indemnify Buyer against all Losses
resulting from such Environmental Defect and associated Remediation pursuant
to an indemnity agreement mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, under which
Seller agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer from any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from such
Environmental Defect based on the current use of the Asset; or  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) require Seller to retain the entirety of the Asset that is
subject to such Environmental Defect (together with all related Assets), and
reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the sum of the Allocated Value
of the Assets so retained; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided, however, that in the event Buyer and Seller do not agree in
writing by Closing on an election of alternative (1), (2) or (3) above with
respect to any Environmental Defect, Buyer and Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed to alternative (3) above with respect to such Environmental
Defect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf Buyer and Seller agree upon the option set forth in clause (1)
above, then Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs
and expenses attributable to the Remediation of the applicable Environmental
Defect and all Losses with respect thereto, and Buyer's obligations with
respect thereto shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Liabilities. If Buyer
and Seller agree upon the option set forth in clause (2) above, Seller shall
have the right to elect to assume responsibility for the Remediation of such
Environmental Defect following Closing and, if Seller so elects (A) Seller
shall use its reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation in a manner
which is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely
fashion for the type of Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and (B)
Buyer, effective as of the Closing, hereby grants to Seller and its
Representatives access to the Assets to conduct such Remediation; provided
that such Remediation shall be at Seller's sole, risk cost and expense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) In connection with any Remediation conducted by Seller and
its Representatives following Closing under Section 5.3(e), Seller agrees to
comply with all reasonable safety policies and other requirements of Buyer and
the operator of the Assets (whether such operator is Buyer, an Affiliate of
Buyer or a Third Party). Seller shall coordinate its access rights and
assessments of the Assets with Buyer and any Third Party operator of the
Assets to reasonably minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the
conduct of business by Buyer or any such Third Party operator of the Assets.
During all times during the period that the Seller and/or any of its
Representatives are on the Assets to conduct Remediation, Seller shall
maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts reasonably
requested by Buyer. Coverage under all insurance required to be carried by
Seller hereunder will (1) be primary insurance (2) list the Buyer Indemnified
Parties as additional insureds, (3) waive subrogation against the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and (4) provide for five days prior notice to Buyer in the
event of cancellation or modification of the policy or reduction in  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-40-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tcoverage. Upon request by Buyer, Seller shall provide evidence of
such insurance to Buyer prior to entering the Assets. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, SELLER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND
HOLD HARMLESS BUYER AND THE OTHER BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL LOSSES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACCESS
AFFORDED TO SELLER AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES PURSUANT TO SECTION 5.3(e) OR THE
ACTIVITIES (OR ACTS OF OMISSION) OF SELLER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES RELATED TO
SUCH ACCESS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY REMEDIATION, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF
SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Environmental Dispute Resolution Procedure. If prior to the
Closing Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any Environmental Disputed
Matter, then either such Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of
written notice to the other Party (each, an "Environmental Dispute Notice"),
to Dispute such Environmental Disputed Matter and to invoke the Dispute
resolution provisions below in this Section 5.3(f) in order to resolve any
such Dispute. As used herein, the term "Environmental Disputed Matter" means
a Dispute regarding any of the following: (w) the existence and scope of an
Environmental Defect; (x) any Environmental Defect Value; (y) the
Environmental Adjustment Amount, if any; and (z) the adequacy of Seller's
Environmental Defect Remediation actions. Any Environmental Dispute Notice
must be delivered on or before the tenth Business Day after Closing. In no
event will Closing be delayed on account of any Environmental Disputed Matter
and if the Environmental Defect Property affected thereby is transferred to
Buyer at Closing, the average of Buyer and Seller's respective good faith
estimates of the Environmental Defect Values attributable to such
Environmental Defect Property shall be used in the calculation and
determination of the Environmental Adjustment Amount to be used at Closing,
subject to the Parties' ongoing rights under this Section 5.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve all Environmental
Disputed Matters through good faith negotiations for a period of 20 days after
the delivery of an Environmental Dispute Notice by either such Party.
Following such negotiation period, if the Environmental Disputed Matter at
issue should remain in Dispute, such Environmental Disputed Matter shall be
resolved pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) and Buyer and Seller shall mutually
appoint an independent expert having the qualifications specified below (the
"Environmental Defect Expert"). If Buyer and Seller are unable to mutually
agree upon the Environmental Defect Expert, then Buyer and Seller shall,
within ten days after the expiration of such negotiation period, request (and
either such Party may so request alone if the other Party refuses to jointly
act in good faith to do so during such ten day period) that the AAA, acting
through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint the Environmental Defect
Expert. The Environmental Defect Expert shall be a certified environmental
professional having a minimum of ten years' experience with regard to the
types of environmental defects affecting the Properties involved in the
Environmental Disputed Matter, shall be without any conflicts of interest as
to Buyer and Seller, and shall not have been employed by or undertaken more
than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for any  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-41-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tParty or its Affiliates within the five year period preceding the
submission of the Dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the Environmental
Defect Expert will function as an expert in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 5.3(f), not as an arbitrator. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2) Within 30 days following the appointment of the
Environmental Defect Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall provide the
Environmental Defect Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each such Party
shall provide, both to the Environmental Defect Expert and each other, a
summary of its position with regard to each such outstanding Environmental
Disputed Matter in a written document of five pages or less per Environmental
Disputed Matter. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Environmental Defect
Expert that, within 30 days after receiving Buyer and Seller's respective
submissions, the Environmental Defect Expert shall render a written decision.
In rendering its decision, the Environmental Defect Expert shall not award a
higher Environmental Defect Value than the good faith amount claimed by Buyer
in its summary or a lower Environmental Defect Value than the good faith
amount claimed by Seller in its summary, as applicable. Any decision rendered
by the Environmental Defect Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive,
and binding on Seller and Buyer, and will be enforceable against each such
Party in any court having jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either or
both such Parties, but is not reviewable by, or appealable to, any court
except in the event of fraud. Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-half of
the costs of the Environmental Defect Expert and of any associated Dispute
resolution process and proceedings, except Buyer and Seller shall each bear
its own legal fees with respect to any Dispute.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an
Environmental Defect did not exist or that an Environmental Defect existed but
was Remediated by Seller, then any Environmental Defect Value attributable
thereto that was included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount used at
Closing, if any, shall be credited to Seller in the Final Settlement
Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an
Environmental Defect exists, but that the Environmental Defect Value
attributable thereto is a lesser amount than any Environmental Defect Value
with respect thereto that was included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount
used at Closing, if any, then the difference thereof shall be credited to
Seller in the Final Settlement Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5) If the Environmental Defect Expert determines that an
Environmental Defect exists, such Environmental Defect has not been Remediated
by Seller and the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto is a greater
amount than the any Environmental Defect Value with respect thereto that was
included in the Environmental Adjustment Amount used at Closing, if any, then
the difference thereof shall be credited to Buyer in the Final Settlement
Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6) Any such adjustments to the amount of the Purchase Price
will be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, if any Asset is retained by Seller
pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(3), the Dispute resolution provisions set forth in
this Section 5.3(f) will not apply and no  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-42-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tconveyance of such Asset would be made to Buyer and no payment will
thereafter be required by Buyer in connection with any such Asset so retained.
 \t\t

this Agreement; (B) was, prior to the Effective Time, acquired independently
by Buyer from a Third Party who (i) lawfully obtained such Confidential
Information, (ii) did not derive such Confidential Information directly or
indirectly from Seller or its Representatives and Confidential Information and

provided that Buyer will make all reasonable efforts to give Seller prior
written notice of any such required disclosure and the opportunity to seek a
protective order if Seller wishes, all to the extent permitted by applicable
Law; provided further, if Seller wishes, but is unable, to obtain such
protective order, then (I) Buyer may disclose to the appropriate Governmental
Entity or other authority only that portion of the Confidential Information
which Buyer is legally required to disclose and Buyer shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to
the Confidential Information and (II) Buyer shall not be liable to Seller for
such disclosure to the extent made in accordance with this Section. \t\t

Governmental Entity or stock exchange. With respect to the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer shall ensure that each such Affiliate and other
Representative is aware of Buyer's obligations under this Section 8.2(c)(3)(A)
and shall ensure compliance by each such Affiliate and other Representative
with all such obligations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
including Section 15.12, Buyer and any of its Affiliates may, without the
prior written consent of Seller or any of its Affiliates, disclose the text or

periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as

terminate 12 months following the date of this Agreement in the event no
Closing has occurred by that date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.3 Covenants and Agreements of the Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach. If
Buyer or Seller obtains Knowledge prior to Closing that leads either such
Party to believe that the other Party has breached a representation or
warranty or failed to perform a covenant or agreement under this Agreement,
the non-breaching Party shall inform the alleged breaching Party in writing of
such potential breach as soon as reasonably practicable so that the breaching
Party may attempt to remedy or cure such breach prior to the Closing. If such
breach or failure is thereafter cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the
non-breaching Party by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the
date this Agreement terminates), then such breach or failure shall be deemed
not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.  \t\t

under the right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty Loss"), Seller shall
promptly advise Buyer in writing of such Casualty Loss and shall elect, by the
delivery of written notice to Buyer at least five Business Days prior to the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Operatorship. To the extent Seller or one of its Affiliates
is designated as operator of certain Assets pursuant to joint operating
agreements with Third Parties included in the Applicable Contracts, Buyer
acknowledges that such Third Parties may not agree to allow Buyer to succeed
Seller or its Affiliate as operator under such joint operating agreements or
may exercise other rights that they may have which would preclude Buyer from
succeeding Seller or its Affiliate as operator. Buyer specifically
acknowledges and agrees that Seller has made no representation, warranty or
other guarantee that Buyer will succeed Seller or its Affiliate as operator
under any joint operating agreement; provided that Seller shall use its
commercially reasonably efforts to support Buyer's succession of Seller or its
Affiliate as operator as to any of the Assets (subject to the provisions of
any applicable joint operating agreement), including soliciting the written
vote of any co-working interest owner of the Assets to Buyer's succession of
Seller or its Affiliates as operator. Prior to Closing, Seller shall not (and

joint operating agreements and unit operating agreements covering the
Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Employees of Seller. Buyer agrees that, without Seller's
prior written consent and excepting only as expressly otherwise provided

indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates who have provided services in relation to the Assets or with whom
Buyer has had contact or who became known to Buyer in connection with Buyer's
consideration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that, so long as Buyer has not breached its obligations hereunder, Buyer shall
not be precluded from hiring any such employee or other Person who (1)
responds to any advertisement to the public or the industry generally that is
not directly or indirectly targeted at employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or (2) has been terminated (and not rehired) by Seller or any of
its Affiliates prior to commencement of employment discussions between Buyer
and such employee or other Person.  \t\t

required applications and conduct negotiations with each Governmental Entity
as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or

(2) provide such information as each may reasonably request to make such
filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each of the
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings, applications, and
negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Parties determine that a
filing under the HSR Act is required, then, within ten Business Days following
the Execution Date, the Parties will prepare and file with the DOJ and the FTC
the notification and report form required by the HSR Act for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and request early termination of the waiting
period thereunder. Each of the Parties agree to respond promptly to any
inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in all
material respects with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. the Parties

connection with the HSR Act filings made pursuant to this Section 8.3(e) shall
be borne by Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Amendment of Schedules. Buyer agrees that Seller shall have
the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules
and Exhibits with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which,
if existing or known as of the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules and Exhibits and that
Seller shall simultaneously with any addition, supplement or amendment provide
copies thereof to Buyer. For purposes of determining whether the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE 10 or otherwise in this Agreement have been fulfilled and
for the purposes of determining any indemnity or other Claim pursuant to this
Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to only include that information contained therein on the Execution
Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto by Seller after the Execution Date under this
Section 8.3(f). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 9 
TAX MATTERS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1 Asset Tax Liability. Subject to the treatment of real
property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes
("Property Taxes") provided below, all Asset Taxes for Tax periods that begin
before and end on or after the Effective Time shall be allocated between Buyer
and Seller as of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the
Effective Time. All Asset Taxes that are not Property Taxes shall be
allocated to Seller to the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon production prior
to the Effective Time and to Buyer to the extent they relate to Hydrocarbon
production on or after the Effective Time. No liability for Asset Taxes shall
duplicate an adjustment to Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 2.4.
Property Taxes for each assessment period shall be allocated to Seller based
on the percentage of the assessment period occurring before the Effective Time
and to Buyer based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or
after the Effective Time. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly furnish to
the other Party copies of any Asset Tax assessments and statements (or
invoices therefor from any applicable Third Party operator of the Assets)
received by it, to the extent such assessment, statement, or invoice relates
to an Asset Tax allocable to the other Party under this Section 9.1. Buyer
and Seller will agree to estimates of (i) all Asset Taxes asserted against
Seller that are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets to
the extent relating to the period on and after the Effective Time and through
the Closing Date, together with all Subject Transfer Taxes, and (ii) Property
Taxes to be asserted against Buyer after the Closing Date that are
attributable to the percentage of the assessment period occurring before the
Effective Time, and such estimates shall be incorporated into the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts
differ from the estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and
are known at the time of the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted
for in the Final Settlement Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at
the time of the Final Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated,
as necessary, based on the best information available at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.2 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, stamp,
documentary, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer Taxes but excluding Taxes on gross income, net

property transfers undertaken pursuant to this Agreement ("Subject Transfer
Taxes") shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. Buyer

eliminate any Subject Transfer Taxes. Buyer agrees to file all Subject
Transfer Tax Returns relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes and to reasonably
consult with Seller regarding any such filing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.3 Tax Returns. Seller shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns due with respect to the Assets before the Closing Date, and Seller
shall provide Buyer with any information Seller has that is reasonably
necessary for Buyer to file any required Tax Return with respect to Asset
Taxes that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared by Buyer in a manner consistent with the prior practice of Seller, to
the extent permitted by Law and in a manner consistent with the allocation
described in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and, if applicable, the Final
Section 1060 Allocation Schedule. Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of
completed drafts of such Tax Returns at least 20 days prior to the due date
for filing thereof, to the extent reasonably practicable, along with
supporting work papers, for Seller's review. Buyer shall consider in good
faith any comment that Seller submits to Buyer no less than ten days prior to
the due date of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall file all such Tax Returns and,
subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, pay all Asset Taxes due and payable
with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent Buyer makes any payment of
Asset Taxes pursuant to this Section 9.3 for which Seller is liable pursuant
to Section 9.1 and which exceeds the amount taken into account in the Final
Settlement Statement, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such excess amount no
later than ten days after Buyer delivers a statement to Seller setting forth
the amount of reimbursement to which Buyer is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement. To the extent Seller makes any payment of Asset Taxes pursuant
to this Section 9.3 for which Buyer is liable pursuant to Section 9.1 and
which exceeds the amount taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement,
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for such excess amount no later than ten days
after Seller delivers a statement to Buyer setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which Seller is entitled along with such supporting evidence
as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.4 Tax Cooperation. Buyer and Seller shall each cooperate
fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding (each, a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes relating to
or in connection with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of such Records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Any information obtained under this Section 9.4 shall be held
confidential by the receiving Party in the same manner as it holds
confidential its own similar information, except (a) as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding or (b) with the consent of the
Party that supplied such information. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.5 Like Kind Exchange. Buyer and Seller agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation (without risk, expense or
extraordinary commitment of personnel or other resources) in any attempt to
qualify (a) the transfer of the Assets by Seller with respect to this
transaction or (b) the purchase of the Assets by Buyer, with respect to a
separate transaction  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\twhereby Buyer transfers other oil and gas properties to a Third Party,
as part of a like-kind exchange of property within the meaning of Section 1031
of the Code, through a trust, escrow or other reasonable means; provided,
however, that (1) Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for
any cost, expense, obligation or other liability, without limitation, which
Buyer may suffer in connection with or arising out of Buyer's cooperation with
Seller's treatment of the sale of the Assets as part of a like-kind exchange
and on account of Buyer's cooperation with Seller's attempt to qualify the
transfer of the Assets by Seller with respect to this transaction as a like-
kind exchange, and (2) Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from any cost, expense, obligation or other liability, without limitation,
which Seller may suffer in connection with or arising out of Seller's
cooperation with Buyer's treatment of the purchase of the Assets as part of a
separate like-kind exchange and on account of Seller's cooperation with
Buyer's attempt to qualify the purchase of the Assets by Buyer with respect to
this transaction as a like-kind exchange. Each of Buyer and Seller shall have
the right to assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement,
in whole or in part, to a "qualified intermediary" (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-l(g)(4)) or as otherwise necessary or
appropriate to effectuate a like-kind exchange, and each other Party agrees to
recognize said qualified intermediary. Each of Buyer and Seller shall be
solely responsible for assuring the effectiveness of any exchange for its Tax
purposes, and each other Party makes no representation or undertaking with
regard to such effectiveness. In no event shall any like-kind exchange
contemplated by this provision cause an extension of the Closing Date set
forth in this Agreement, except as may otherwise be mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller in writing. \t\t

of all the Assets operated by Seller or its Affiliates and for Buyer or an
Affiliate thereof to succeed Seller or its Affiliates as operator of all such
Assets, including Railroad Commission of Texas Form P-4s executed by Seller or
its Affiliates, as applicable; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer an affidavit of
non-foreign status under Section 1445 of the Code in the form of Exhibit E;
and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 13 
POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.1 Post-Closing Adjustments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Final Settlement Statement. On the date that is 180 days
after the Closing (or if such date is not a business day, the first business
day thereafter) except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein or
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, (the "Final Settlement Statement Due
Date"), Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer, in accordance
with GAAP and customary industry accounting practices, a settlement statement
setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with Section
2.4 and showing the calculation of such adjustments and the resulting final
purchase price (the "Final Purchase Price" and such statement, the "Final
Settlement Statement"). Within 30 days after its receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report
containing any changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final Settlement
Statement. Buyer's failure to deliver to Seller a written report detailing
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement by such date shall be
deemed to be an acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement
delivered by Seller. Buyer and Seller shall endeavor to agree with respect to
the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, by no later than 60 days after Buyer's
receipt of Seller's proposed Final Settlement Statement. Should Buyer and
Seller fail to agree on the Final Settlement Statement and Final Purchase
Price by such date, either such Party may invoke the Dispute resolution
procedures provided for in Section 13.1(b). The date upon which such
agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is determined
pursuant to Section 13.1(b) shall be herein called the "Final Settlement
Date." If such agreed or determined Final Purchase Price is more than the
Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such
difference by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than five
Business Days after the Final Settlement Date. If such agreed or determined
Final Purchase Price is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Seller shall
pay the amount of such difference to Buyer by wire transfer in immediately
available funds no later than five Business Days after the Final Settlement
Date. Prior to the Final Settlement Date, Seller and its Representatives
shall provide all reasonable assistance to the Buyer and its Representatives
including (i) granting full access to the relevant books and records of Seller
and its Representatives, the personnel of, and work papers or other documents
of, Seller and its Representatives to the extent that they relate to the Final
Settlement Statement and Buyer's written report as contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall and shall
cause its Representatives to (a) respond promptly, in good faith and as fully
and accurately as is reasonably  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-65-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tpossible, to reasonable inquiries related to the review by Buyer and
its Representatives and (b) if requested, provide reasonable access to and
copies of the books, records, work papers, documents and other information
described above both in written form and electronically. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Dispute Resolution. Within ten days after either Buyer or
Seller invokes the Dispute resolution procedures of this Section 13.1(b)
pursuant to Section 13.1(a), Buyer and Seller shall mutually appoint (and
either such Party may on its own appoint such expert if the other Party
refuses to act in good faith to jointly appoint such expert during such ten
day period) an independent expert having the qualifications specified below
(the "Accounting Expert"). If Buyer and Seller are unable to mutually agree
upon the Accounting Expert within such ten day period, then Buyer and Seller
shall, within ten days after the expiration of such foregoing ten day period,
request that the AAA, acting through its offices in Houston, Texas, appoint
the Accounting Expert. The Accounting Expert shall be a certified public
accountant having a minimum of ten years' experience with regard to the types
of matters involved in the Dispute, shall be without any conflicts of interest
as to Buyer and Seller, and shall not have been employed by or undertaken more
than $50,000 of work, in the aggregate, for any Party or its Affiliates within
the five year period preceding the submission of the Dispute. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Expert will function as an expert in
accordance with the foregoing procedure, not as an arbitrator. Within 15 days
following the appointment of the Accounting Expert, Seller and/or Buyer shall
provide the Accounting Expert with a copy of this Agreement, and each such
Party shall provide, both to the Accounting Expert and to each other, a
summary of its position with regard to each such outstanding matter involving
the Final Settlement Statement in a written document of five pages or less per
outstanding Disputed matter. Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Accounting
Expert that, within 30 days after receiving the last of Buyer and Seller's
respective submissions or the expiration of such 15 day period if either such
Party fails to make a submission, the Accounting Expert shall render a
decision, choosing only either Buyer's position or Seller's position with
respect to each Disputed matter. Any decision rendered by the Accounting
Expert pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Buyer, and will be enforceable against each such Party in any court having
jurisdiction hereof or jurisdiction of either or both such Parties, but is not
reviewable by, or appealable to, any court except in the event of fraud.
Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-half of the costs of the Accounting
Expert and of any associated Dispute resolution proceedings, except Buyer and
Seller shall each bear its own legal fees with respect to any Dispute. The
Final Settlement Statement shall be re-issued by Seller if and as necessary to
conform to the Accounting Expert's decision.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.2 Records. Seller shall make the Records available for pick
up by Buyer within 15 days following the Closing Date. Seller may retain
copies of the Records, and Seller shall, at its sole cost, expense and risk,
have the right to review and copy the original Records during standard
business hours and upon reasonable notice to Buyer for so long as Buyer
retains the Records, which shall be a minimum of six years after the Closing
Date. Buyer agrees that the Records will be maintained in compliance with all
applicable Laws governing document retention.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.3 Further Assurances. From time to time after Closing,
Seller and Buyer shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such
further instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested
by the other Party, at such requesting Party's cost, and as are commercially
reasonable to be performed in order to accomplish more effectively the
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including those
post-Closing actions  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-66-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tcontemplated by Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.4(b). Promptly after
Closing, Buyer shall: (a) record the Assignments of the Assets and all state
and federal assignments executed at the Closing in all applicable real
property records and/or, if applicable, all state and federal Governmental
Entities and Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of such recorded documents;
(b) actively pursue the approval of all Customary Post-Closing Consents from
the applicable Governmental Entities; and (c) subject to the preceding
sentence and Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.4(b) actively pursue all other
consents and approvals that may be required in connection with the assignment
of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of the rights, interests,
obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder that have not been
obtained prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in obtaining such other consents and approvals, at Buyer's
cost. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t13.4 Tax Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If notice of any action, suit, investigation, audit or other
Claim is received by Buyer with respect to Taxes for which Seller may
reasonably be expected to be liable under this Agreement or applicable Law (a
"Tax Claim"), Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such Tax Claim within
ten (10) days after it is received by Buyer; provided that failure to timely
provide such notice shall not affect the right of Buyer's indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent Seller is prejudiced by such delay or
omission. Such notice shall contain factual information describing the
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Governmental Authority in respect
of any such asserted Tax liability.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), at its
sole cost and liability and subject to releasing Seller from all obligations
and to defending, indemnifying and holding Seller harmless from all
liabilities under and with respect to any such Tax Claim, to elect to
represent the interests of Seller in defending, settling, compromising,
admitting, or acknowledging any Tax Claim received by Buyer as described in
Section 13.4(a); provided, that Buyer shall keep Seller fully and currently
apprised of all developments relating to such Tax Claim, and that Buyer shall
not settle such Tax Claim without the consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and also provided that
if Buyer so elects to represent the interests of Seller in any such Tax Claim,
at the further election of Seller (in the event Buyer elects to so represent
the interests of Seller as to any such Tax Claim), Buyer and Seller shall
jointly control (and shall share the costs and liabilities in accordance with
the allocation of Taxes set forth in Section 9.1) any defense, settlement,
compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any Tax Claim, in which event no
Tax Claim shall be settled or compromised without the prior written approval
of each of Buyer and Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by either such Party. In the event Buyer does not so
elect to represent the interests of Seller in any Tax Claim, the provisions of
Section 14.3(b) shall govern the conduct of any such Tax Claim. Buyer and
Seller shall each provide the other with all information reasonably necessary
to conduct a Tax Claim with respect to Taxes or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall file an amended Tax Return
relating to or in connection with the Assets with respect to any period or
partial period ended on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the other Party, if such amendment would have,  \t\t

consenting Party under this Agreement or under applicable Law. \t\t

connection with or were otherwise resulting from the operation of the Assets
by Seller prior to the Closing Date; or (13) all lawsuits, litigation, audits,
arbitrations and other similar proceedings pending or threatened as of the

OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Limitations on Indemnity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller and SN shall have no liability for defense and indemnification
hereunder or for any Loss pursuant to Section 14.2(a)(1) unless (A) the amount
of an applicable indemnifiable Loss exceeds $100,000 (the "Per Item
Threshold") and (B) the total value of all such Losses exceeding the Per Item
Threshold (including for the avoidance of doubt, any amount below the Per Item
Threshold if such Loss exceeds the Per Item Threshold), in the aggregate,

point the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to defense and
indemnification pursuant to Section 14.2(a)(1) only to the incremental extent

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-69-  \t\t  \t\t

"Cap").  \t\t

 \t\t

this Section 14.2(c), the Per Item Threshold, Deductible and Cap will not
apply, to (A) any breach by Seller or SN of any of its Fundamental
Representations or the representations of Seller set forth in Section 6.19,
Section 6.20 or Section 6.22, or (B) any breach by Seller of any covenant or
agreement including any obligations under Section 13.1, Section 13.4 or
Section 14.2(a)(3); provided, however, that in no event shall Seller and
SN's aggregate liability under the aforementioned provisions of this
Agreement, exceed 100% of the Purchase Price.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall Seller have any obligation to provide indemnification for
any amount of damages to the extent specially reserved for the Final
Settlement Statement and for the avoidance of doubt if the relevant damages
exceed the amounts so accounted for, and such damages are otherwise payable
under this ARTICLE 14, Buyer shall be entitled to recover the excess of the
relevant damages over the amount accounted for in such Settlement
Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Sole Remedy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, from and after Closing, Seller's and Buyer's sole and exclusive
remedies for damages (other than for Claims arising from Person's fraudulent,
criminal or intentional misconduct or any other willful or intentional breach
of this Agreement) against each other with respect to any and all Claims for
breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, the Assignment or the Specified Contracts
Assignment (including the affirmations of the representations and warranties
contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Section 10.2(c) and Section 10.3(c), as applicable) or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, are exclusively set forth in
Section 3.3(c), Section 4.2(j), Section 5.3(e), Section 9.3, Section 9.5,
Section 11.2, this Section 14.2 and the "special warranty" contained in the
Assignment, and if no such right of defense or indemnification or to be held
harmless is expressly provided in Section 3.3(c), Section 4.2(j), Section
5.3(e), Section 9.3, Section 9.5, Section 11.2, this Section 14.2 or the
"special warranty" contained in the Assignment, then such Claims are hereby
waived by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Except for the
remedies contained in Section 3.3(c), Section 4.2(j), Section 5.3(e),
Section 9.3, Section 9.5, Section 11.2, this Section 14.2 and the "special
warranty" contained in the Assignment, each Party (including as to its
respective Indemnified Parties) releases, remises, and forever discharges the
other Party (including as to its respective Indemnified Parties) from any and
all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, Claims, demands, damages,
Losses, costs, liabilities, interest, causes of action and other obligations
whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might
now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising out of this
Agreement, Seller's ownership, use, or operation of the Assets, or the
condition, quality, status, or nature of the Assets, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO
CONTRIBUTION OR COST RECOVERY  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-70-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tUNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND
LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON
LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE, SIMPLE, SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT),
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON, INVITEE OR THIRD
PERSON, OR BY A PREEXISTING CONDITION. Notwithstanding anything in the
Agreement to the contrary, nothing shall limit any Person's right to seek and
obtain Specific performance or any other equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Person's fraudulent,
criminal or intentional misconduct or any other willful or intentional breach
of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Waiver of Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
from Seller, Buyer, or their respective Affiliates or other Representatives,
any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or
speculative damages, including damages for lost profits of any kind, arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, any other agreement, contract or
instrument contemplated herein or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
to the extent any such Party suffers such damages (including costs of defense
and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this
Agreement, any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein or
the transactions contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of determining whether
a breach has occurred on account of a Loss resulting from a breach of any of
Seller's representations and warranties for which Buyer would be entitled to
indemnification under Section 14.2(a)(1), any dollar or materiality
qualifications in Seller's representations and warranties shall be
disregarded. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.3 Claims Procedure. The defense, indemnification and hold
harmless obligations contained in Section 3.3(c), Section 5.3(e), Section
9.5, this Section 14.3 and the "special warranty" contained in the Assignment
shall be implemented as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Claim Notice. The Party seeking defense and indemnification
under the terms of this Agreement ("Indemnified Party") shall submit a written
"Claim Notice" to the other Party ("Indemnifying Party") which, to be
effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the survival period
applicable under Section 14.4 to the particular Loss that is the subject of
such Claim Notice and must state, to the extent of the information reasonably
available to the Indemnified Party: (1) the amount of each payment or other
obligation claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing or other Loss for which
the Indemnified Party is seeking defense, indemnification and to be held
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-71-  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tharmless, (2) the basis for such Claim, with supporting documentation
if available, and (3) a list identifying, to the extent reasonably possible,
each separate item of Loss for which payment or any other obligation is so
claimed. Within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
may provide written notice to the Indemnified Party that it accepts, contests
or rejects the Losses identified in such Claim Notice or its responsibility
for same. Any failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide such notice within
such time period shall be deemed to be a rejection by such Indemnifying Party
of such Losses and its responsibility for same. If the Indemnifying Party
objects to a Claim Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information,
it shall promptly request from the Indemnified Party any specific additional
information reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall provide the additional information reasonably
requested to the extent reasonably available to it. Upon receipt of such
additional information, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. All disputed
defense, indemnification and hold harmless Claims shall be resolved by Buyer
and Seller in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Buyer and
Seller, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) Section 15.8(b), which
may be invoked by either such Party at any time when it reasonably believes
that Buyer and Seller are unable to reach mutual agreement as to any defense,
indemnification and hold harmless Claim arising under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Information. Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives
notice of a Claim or legal action by a Third Party that may result in a Loss
for which defense, indemnification and the right to be held harmless may be
sought under this ARTICLE 14 (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party
shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other
material information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes and
acknowledges its responsibility for such Third Party Claim, then, at the
election of the Indemnifying Party, made within 30 days after receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume
sole management and control of such Third Party Claim (to the extent only that
such Third Party Claim relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party has
agreed and acknowledges that it is liable), including the determination of all
appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the
Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can
result in any cost or other liability to the Indemnified Party without its
consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, (1) any and
all expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation,
defense or other handling of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, except as to those reasonable expenses incurred in responding to any
request or instruction by the Indemnifying Party and (2) the Indemnified Party
shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary,
that the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request as necessary for the
proper defense of such Third Party Claim. In the absence of such an election,
the Indemnified Party will reasonably endeavor to defend, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, any Third Party Claim to which such Indemnifying Party's
defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation under this ARTICLE 14
applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, the Indemnified Party may settle or otherwise resolve the same
in the Indemnified Party's reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party's
expense and liability, subject to the Indemnifying Party's consent, which
shall not be unreasonably  \t\t

 \t\t\twithheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that if the
Indemnifying Party fails to grant such consent, it shall immediately assume
such defense, indemnification and hold harmless obligation from the
Indemnified Party and reimburse the Indemnified Party for all expenses and
other obligations and liabilities incurred by it prior to such point in time.
If any such Third Party Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take
appropriate action so as not to jeopardize the defense of such Third Party
Claim or a Party's position with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof,
subject to the Indemnifying Party's sole management and control of the defense
of any such Third Party Claim in its sole good faith judgment; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the reasonable attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified
Party's counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party in writing that there
is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and
one local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such
Third Party Claim). In the event that the Indemnifying Party has any Dispute
regarding whether it is obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Party as to any Third Party Claim or other Claim or any Dispute as
to the scope of any such defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligation as to
a Third Party Claim or other Claim, such Dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller, which
shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) Section 15.8(b), which may be invoked
by any Party at any time when it reasonably believes that the Parties are
unable to reach mutual agreement as to any defense, indemnification and hold
harmless Claim arising under this Agreement. \t\t

indemnities in (1) Section 14.2(a)(1), Section 14.2(a)(2), Section
14.2(b)(2) and Section 14.2(b)(3) shall terminate as of the termination date,

14.2(a)(6), Section 14.2(a)(9), Section 14.2(a)(10), Section 14.2(a)(12)
and Section 14.2(b)(1) shall survive the Closing without time limit. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.5 Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing herein is intended
to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any
Third Party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with
respect to the Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t14.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment pursuant
to this ARTICLE 14 shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the

 \t\t\t15.4 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument expressly modifying this Agreement signed by each of the Parties.
Except for waivers specifically provided for in this Agreement, no waiver by
any Party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding
unless made expressly in writing. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), and no such waiver shall
constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly so provided. Delay in the
exercise, or non-exercise, of any such right is not a waiver of that
right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t15.5 Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.5
and as set forth in the succeeding sentence, no Party shall assign all or any
portion of its respective rights or delegate all or any portion of its
respective duties and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other Parties which consent may be withheld for any reason or no
reason. Any such attempted assignment which does not comply with the
foregoing provisions shall be deemed null and void. Notwithstanding the
foregoing (a) Buyer may assign all of its rights and delegate all of its
duties and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer, (b) no assignment or delegation hereunder by Carrizo
(Eagle Ford) LLC, as Buyer, shall relieve Carrizo (Eagle Ford) LLC (or any of
its successors) of any of Buyer's liabilities and obligations hereunder, and
(c) prior to making any such permitted assignment to a direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary, Buyer must obtain Seller's consent to the form of
assignment used for such assignment, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. In the event of an assignment hereunder pursuant to subsection (a)
above, the assignee shall be entitled to and undertake the same rights and
obligations herein of Buyer as if such assignee were a party hereto and the
Parties agree that  \t\t
