3.2.2. Adjustment. Sellers and Buyer agree that there shall be an adjustment
made within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date to adjust for any liabilities
that are found to exist of the Sellers as of the Closing Date, as such
liabilities may relate to the Purchased Assets or the business of Sellers, so
that the Sellers shall be responsible and liable to Buyer for the liabilities

Command Center, Inc., par value $0.001, based upon the operating performance
of Sellers' assets over the two year period following the Closing. The earnout
is designed so that the maximum number of 1,500,000 Shares will be earned if
(i) the gross margin of Seller's business measured over the period of eight
fiscal quarters following the closing increases by an average of 5% or more
per quarter and (ii) the market price for the stock is $0.50 or less.

  

  

 

 

 

Asset Purchase Agreement

 

 

  

 

Page 4 of 62  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

In calculating the number of shares to be awarded on a quarterly basis, gross
margin is deemed to be 30% of accrued revenue and net profit is deemed to
equal 30% of gross margin. Therefore, Net equals 9% of revenue. In these
calculations, Share Price is deemed to be the greater of $0.50 or 80% of
market price.

  


 

  

Number of shares to be awarded = (Net ÷ Share Price ÷ 2) + (Net - $123,750 ÷
Share Price).

  


 

  

As an example only for purposes of illustrating the foregoing, assume that
quarterly revenue = $1,443,750 and share price is $0.40. Then, Number of
shares to be awarded = (1,443,750 X 9% ÷ .50 ÷ 2) + (1,443,750 X 9% -123,750 ÷
.50) = (129937) + (12,375) = 142,313.

  


 

  

This calculation shall be made for each of the eight full fiscal quarters
following the closing. The calculation shall be made not later than 45 days
following the end of the fiscal quarter. The share price shall be determined
based upon the average closing price for the 10 days preceding the
calculation. The total number of shares of Command Center, Inc., stock to be
awarded under this process shall be limited to 1,500,000.

  


 

  

3.4. Allocation of the Purchase Price. Buyer and Sellers agree to cooperate in
reporting the allocation of the Purchase Price as provided on the attached
Schedule 3.4.

  


 

  

3.5. Closing Date. The "Closing Date" or "Closing" will occur on January 4th,
2012, and will take place at the offices of Sellers at 921 Oxley Street,
Kenner, Louisiana, or at such other time and place as the parties may agree to
in writing.

  


 

  

3.5.1. Control. At Closing and upon payment of $150,000 to Sellers, Buyer
shall have sole and unfettered operational control of the Acquired Assets.
However, subject to the terms of this Agreement, this transaction shall be

10.2. Utilities. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate to take all steps necessary
to transfer all utilities and services related to the operation and conduct of
Sellers' business, including, without limitation, electric service, gas
service, telephone service, sewage, water, and trash removal, into Buyer's
name effective as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer will pay
for any new deposits or connection fees required.

  

  

10.3. Transition. Sellers will maintain the goodwill of Sellers' suppliers,
customers, and business, and will otherwise cooperate with Buyer to effectuate
a smooth and orderly transition in the operation and conduct of Sellers'
business following the Closing Date.

  


 

  

11. Remedies.

  


 

  

11.1. Remedies Prior to or on Closing.

  


 

  

 

A. In the event of any breach or default of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition, or other obligation of Sellers under this
Agreement, Buyer may, at its option, and without prejudice to any rights or
remedies Buyer may have at law or in equity for any such breach or default
terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice of termination to
Sellers on or before the Closing Date. The notice will specify with
particularity the breach or default on which the notice is based.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that the Assets are
unique and that, in the event of a breach or default by Sellers under this
Agreement, it would be extremely impracticable to measure monetary damages and
such damages would be an inadequate remedy for Buyer. Therefore, in the event
of any such breach or default, Buyer may, at its option, sue for specific
performance in addition to any other available right or remedies.

 

  


 

  

B. In the event of any breach or default of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition, or other obligation of Buyer under this
Agreement, Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy will be to terminate this
Agreement by delivering written notice of termination to Buyer on or before
the Closing Date. The notice will specify with particularity the breach or
default on which the notice is based.

  


 

  

C. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Sellers as
provided in this Section 11.1, this Agreement will become null and void, other
than Sections 6 and 10 above, which will remain in full force and effect. Upon
termination, Buyer will deliver to Sellers and Sellers will deliver to Buyer
any and all documentation provided by each party to the other pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

11.2. Remedies Subsequent to Closing. In the event of any breach or default of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition, or other
obligation by either party to this Agreement, the non-defaulting party may
pursue whatever rights and remedies are available to such party at law or in
equity, including, without limitation, the rights and remedies provided in
this Agreement.

12. General Provisions.

  


 

  

12.1. Publicity. All notices to third parties and all other publicity
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be jointly
planned and coordinated by and between Buyer and Sellers. Neither Buyer nor
Sellers will act unilaterally in this regard without the prior written

either party from violating any state or federal securities laws or
regulations.

  


 

  

12.2. Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
each party will be responsible for its own fees, costs, and other expenses
incurred in negotiating and preparing this Agreement and in closing and
carrying out the transactions contemplated hereunder.

  


 

  

12.3. Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. The respective
representations, warranties, and covenants of Buyer and Sellers made in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligations of indemnity
hereunder, will survive the Closing Date, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, until the applicable statute of limitations
has run, notwithstanding any examination made by or for the party to whom such
representations, warranties, or covenants were made, the knowledge of any
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, or agents of the party, or the
acceptance of any certificate or opinion.

  


 

  

12.4. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications
required under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed duly given

PROMISSORY NOTE

  


 

  

For value received the undersigned (hereinafter "Maker") promises to pay to
the order of DR Services of Louisiana, LLC, a Louisiana Limited Liability
Company (hereinafter "Holder"), the principal sum of One Hundred and Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($150,000), all as hereinafter provided and upon the

1. Interest. No interest shall accrue on the principal sum owed to Holder; provided, however, that in the event of any default, as hereinafter defined, all sums then and thereafter owing hereon, at the option of the Holder, shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (the "Default Rate").

  


 

  

2. Payments. Maker shall pay this note in six (6) equal installments on or before the fifth day of every month, beginning February 5, 2012, and continuing until the principal sum has been paid in full.

  


 

  

3. Late Payment Charge. In the event payment is not timely made during any month by Maker under the terms of the Promissory Note, Maker shall pay a late payment penalty of $500 for each day payment is late, with the maximum late penalty for any one month period being $5,000. However, such late payment penalty shall not begin to accrue until five days after written notice of such late payment has been received by Maker. For and under the terms of this paragraph, written notice shall be deemed effective only upon receipt by Maker of such notice of late payment, and such notice of late payment can only be conveyed to Maker via either: (a) certified U.S. Postal Service mailing (delivery signature required); or (b) overnight courier delivery (FedEx, UPS, etc.) (delivery signature required). This is in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights or remedies the Holder may have by virtue of any breach or default.

Section 2, a court, arbitrator, or arbitration panel shall hold that the
duration, scope, or area restrictions set forth herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the duration, scope, or
area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated
duration, scope, or area and that the court, arbitrator, or arbitration panel

deemed too broad, then a 12 month period shall be substituted, and if a 12
month period is deemed too broad, then a 6 month period shall be substituted.

breach and to the maximum extent found enforceable, shall begin to run from
the date that Sellers then again comply with this Agreement.

  


 

  

3. Non-Solicitation Covenant. Sellers recognize and acknowledge that all clients and/or accounts of the Companies during Sellers' relationship with the Companies, including all clients and/or accounts acquired by DRSI due to the Sellers' efforts or pursuant to the APA, are now the clients and accounts of DRSI (collectively "Client Accounts"). Sellers shall not (except pursuant to an employment agreement with DRSI), either individually or as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant, proprietor, partner, creditor, stockholder, member, joint venturer, investor, or other paid participant or principal of another employment staffing business or related business firm (other than DRSI), solicit (by any means, whether orally, written, digital, or electronically) any Client Accounts or provide services to any Client Accounts of clients of DRSI, whether marketing efforts, disaster recovery services, or temporary labor services, for and within the Time Period.

  


 

  

(a) Additional Remedy. If for any reason Sellers (either individually or in
concert) shall attempt to solicit, solicit, acquire or otherwise obtain from
DRSI, by any means whatsoever, Client Accounts or provide services to such
Client Accounts - outside the scope of Sellers' employment with DRSI; then at
the sole election of DRSI, Sellers shall pay to DRSI two times (2x) the actual
annual gross billings of those Client Accounts by DRSI. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Actual Annual Gross Billings of Client Accounts " shall be
computed and determined based upon the actual annual gross billings by DRSI
and the Companies (if applicable) for such Client Accounts, whether actual
fees billed or billable to such Client Accounts, for a twelve month time
period immediately prior to the breach of this Agreement, and shall be
determined without any deductions or reductions against such gross billing
amounts.

  

  

 

 

Asset Purchase Agreement

 

  

 

Page 49 of 62  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

Payment will be remitted to DRSI by or on behalf of Sellers within thirty (30)
days after Sellers (or any Seller individual) solicits any Client Accounts or
provides services to any Client Accounts, or within sixty (60) days of billing
by Sellers to the Client Accounts, whichever comes first. All amounts due DRSI
from Sellers pursuant to this paragraph shall bear interest at two percent
(2%) over the rate announced by the Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as its prime
lending rate, determined as of the Effective Date, but in no event in excess
of the maximum rate permitted by law, on the outstanding balance due under
this paragraph. The foregoing remedy shall be in addition to any other
remedies provided to DRSI hereunder or by law.

  


 

  

(b) Alternatively, at the sole election of DRSI, Sellers (individually and/or
collectively) shall be liable for all damages arising out of or related to
Sellers' collective or individual solicitation or attempted solicitation of
any Client Accounts whether directly or indirectly, which cause DRSI to lose
any Client Accounts or revenue related thereto, suffer a reduction in services
provided to any Client Accounts and/or billings to any Client Accounts.

  


 

  

4. Non-Disparagement. Sellers agree that, during the Time Period, they shall not (individually or collectively) make any written, oral, digital or electronic statements that are materially disparaging of the business of the DRSI or Command Center, Inc., or to the business reputation of any of the executive officers, directors, agents or employees of DRSI or Command Center, Inc.

  


 

  

5. Severability. The parties desire and intend that the covenants contained in this Agreement shall be construed as agreements severable from and independent of each other and of any other provision of this or any contract or agreement between the parties.

  


 

  

6. Injunction. Sellers agree and acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions, duration, and the geographic/territorial scope thereof as set forth in this Agreement are under all of the circumstances reasonable and necessary for the protection of DRSI and its business. Sellers recognize and agree that the injury that DRSI will suffer in the event of Sellers' breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement cannot be compensated by monetary damages alone, and Sellers therefore agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Sellers (individually or collectively) of this Agreement, DRSI, in addition to and not in limitation of, any other rights, remedies, or damages available to DRSI at law, in equity, under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent or restrain any such breach by Sellers or by Sellers' agents, representatives, partners, co-owners, or any and all other persons directly or indirectly acting for or with him/her.

  


 

  

7. Attorneys' Fees. In the event an action or suit is brought by any party hereto to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to the payment of its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as determined by the judge of the court.

  


 

  

8. Choice of Law, Venue and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be deemed made and entered into and construed and governed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho. Sellers consent to jurisdiction and venue of any legal action in the state or federal courts in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

  


 

  

9. Notice. Any notice to be given to Sellers under this Agreement will be sufficient and deemed delivered if in writing and delivered to the U.S. Post Office to be sent prepaid by certified or registered mail addressed to each of the Sellers individually at the address provided below, or to such other address as any Seller has provided to DRSI in writing.

Sellers further acknowledge the receipt and sufficiency of consideration for such benefit.

  


 

  

 

11. Terms of the APA. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the APA and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the APA shall control.

 

  


 

  

12. General.

  


 

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement contains the
entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subjects hereof
and supersedes all prior oral and written negotiations and agreements.

  


 

  

(b) Any modifications to this Agreement must be made by a written agreement
signed by both parties.

gender the context requires.
