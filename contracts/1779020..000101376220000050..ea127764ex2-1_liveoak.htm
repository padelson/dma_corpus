Agent pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ , and any portion of the Adjustment
Holdback Amount and Positive Adjustment Shares (if applicable), respectively,
in each case that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and

similar Laws) for the consideration payable upon surrender of their

owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of shares of Live Oak Class
A Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 2.6(j)_ , all fractional shares
to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and
calculations shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places. In lieu of any such
fractional share of Live Oak Class A Common Stock, each holder of Shares who
would otherwise be entitled to such fractional share of Live Oak Class A
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the __product__  of (i) the

The employees of Live Oak or one of its Subsidiaries who shall be entitled to
receive an initial grant of stock options (" _Initial Option Grant_ ") under
the New Equity Incentive Plan on the Closing (each, a " _Retention Recipient_
") and the number of shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock that will be

in accordance with the vesting terms set forth on _Schedule 2.11_. In the

Retention Recipient shall be entitled to receive a grant of restricted stock
under the New Equity Incentive Plan (each an " _Initial Restricted Stock
Grant_ ") on the Closing. The number of shares of Live Oak Class A Common
stock, if any, that will be subject to each Initial Restricted Stock Grant and

Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,

Company Option_ ") to acquire shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option
(including applicable vesting and exercise conditions) except that (a) the
number of shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock that will be subject to each
such Assumed Company Option shall be determined by __multiplying__ the number
of Shares subject to the corresponding Company Option by a fraction (the "
_Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Closing Per Share
Merger Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole share) multiplied by
the Live Oak Share Price and the denominator of which is the fair
market value of a share of Live Oak Class A Common Stock on the Closing Date
and (b) the exercise price per share of each such Assumed Company Option
shall equal (i) the per share exercise price of the corresponding Company
Option __divided by__  (ii) the Award Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the assumption of and
corresponding adjustments to a Company Option shall be performed in a manner
that is intended to comply with the requirements of Sections 409A or 424(a)
of the Code and, in the case of any Company Option that is an incentive stock
option (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in accordance with
Section 422 of the Code). Within thirty (30) Business Days following the
Closing Date, Live Oak shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other applicable form) with respect to the Live Oak Class A Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Assumed Company Options and shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statements for so long as any Assumed Company Options remain outstanding. Live
Oak shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock for delivery with
respect to the Assumed Company Options in accordance with this _Section
2.12_.

later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date whether such
holder elects to convert such Convertible Note, and notifying such holder that

its reasonable best efforts to mail to each Company Warrant holder a notice,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Live Oak, informing such
holder of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
enclosing an exercise notice to be returned to the Company by such holder no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date whether such
holder elects to exercise such Company Warrant, and notifying such holder that
if such election is not made, following the Closing, the Company Warrant
shall be exercisable in exchange for shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock
instead of Shares.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company Board shall have adopted resolutions
(in a form reasonably satisfactory to Live Oak), and the Company hereby
agrees to take all other actions reasonably necessary, to cause each Company
Warrant that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing to be
exercisable in exchange for shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock
immediately after the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) After the conversion or repayment of the Convertibles Notes, exercise of
the Company Warrants, and adoption of the resolutions by the Company Board
pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ , the Convertible Notes and the Company
Warrants shall no longer represent the right to purchase Shares or any other
Equity Interests of the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Person or the right to receive any other consideration other than as
provided herein.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
 MERGER CONSIDERATION; ADJUSTMENT

  



  

Section 3.1 _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate merger consideration (the
" _Merger Consideration_ ") shall be an amount equal to:

  



  

(a) Four Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($450,000,000);

  



  

(b) _ _minus __ the Closing Date Net Debt;

  



  

(c) _ _minus __ the Transaction Expenses Adjustment Amount; and

  



  

(d) _ _plus __ any Earn-Out Shares issued pursuant to _Section 3.4_.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Estimated Merger Consideration_. At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Live Oak a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Company's
good faith estimate of the Merger Consideration (such estimated amount, the "
_Estimated Merger Consideration_ "), including each of its components. The
Estimated Closing Statement shall also set forth (a) the name and address of
each Shareholder, wire transfer instructions for each Shareholder (if
available), the number of Shares held by each Shareholder, the Certificate
numbers representing the Shares held by each Shareholder, the Percentage
Interest for each Shareholder, and the portion of the Closing Payment that
each Shareholder is entitled to receive, (b) the applicable employees to whom
any portion of the Transaction Expenses is payable, the respective amounts

to the Estimated Closing Statement, including the calculation of the
Estimated Merger Consideration set forth therein, and the Company shall permit
Live Oak and its Representatives to have full access to the books and records
of the Company and to such historical financial information relating to the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Estimated Merger Consideration as Live Oak may reasonably request. The
Company shall promptly consider in good faith any changes Live Oak proposes to
the Estimated Closing Statement and revise the Estimated Closing Statement
if, based on its good faith assessment, such changes are warranted.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

Section 3.3 _Determination of Final Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Live Oak
Representative shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative a
statement (the " _Initial Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Live Oak
Representative's good faith calculation of the Merger Consideration,
including each of its components with reasonable detail to identify and
support variances from the Estimated Closing Statement. The Live Oak
Representative shall prepare the Initial Closing Statement in accordance
with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Shareholder Representative will be entitled to review the Initial
Closing Statement during the thirty (30) day period beginning on the date the
Shareholder Representative receives the Initial Closing Statement. During such
thirty (30) day period, the Shareholder Representative and its
Representatives will have reasonable access to the books and records of the
Company, to work papers prepared by the Live Oak Representative or
Representatives of the Live Oak Representative to the extent they relate to
the Initial Closing Statement, and to such historical financial information
relating to the Initial Closing Statement as the Shareholder
Representative may reasonably request, and will be entitled to meet with
Representatives of the Live Oak Representative on a mutually convenient basis
in order to obtain and discuss such information; _provided_ , that such access
does not interrupt the normal course of the Business. At or prior to the end
of such thirty (30) day period, the Shareholder Representative shall either:

  



  

(i) deliver a notice to the Live Oak Representative confirming that no
adjustments are proposed by the Shareholder Representative to the Live Oak
Representative's calculation of the Merger Consideration or any of its
components, as set forth on the Initial Closing Statement (a " _Notice of
Acceptance_ "); or

  



  

(ii) deliver a notice to the Live Oak Representative to the effect that the
Shareholder Representative disagrees with the Live Oak
Representative's calculation of the Merger Consideration or any of its
components, as set forth on the Initial Closing Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "), and specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such
disagreement (which shall only include disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on the Merger Consideration not being calculated in accordance
with this Agreement) and the adjustments that, in the Shareholder
Representative's view, should be made to the calculation of the Merger
Consideration or any of its components, as applicable, in order to comply
with this Agreement (collectively, the " _Proposed Adjustments_ ");

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Shareholder Representative fails to
deliver a Notice of Acceptance or a Notice of Disagreement within such thirty
(30) day period, then the calculation of the Merger Consideration as set forth
in the Initial Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties as
the " _Final Merger Consideration_."

  



  

(c) If there are any Proposed Adjustments, the Live Oak Representative shall,
no later than thirty (30) days after the Live Oak Representative's receipt of
the Notice of Disagreement, notify the Shareholder Representative whether the
Live Oak Representative accepts or rejects each such Proposed Adjustment.
Thereafter, the Shareholder Representative and the Live Oak Representative
shall work in good faith to resolve any differences that remain with respect
to the Proposed Adjustments. If any of the Proposed Adjustments are not
so resolved (the " _Unresolved Adjustments_ ," and the aggregate difference
between the Parties' respective calculations of the Merger Consideration
resulting from the Unresolved Adjustments, the " _Unresolved Balance_
") within thirty (30) days after the Live Oak Representative's notice to the
Shareholder Representative of its rejection of any Proposed Adjustments (or
such longer period as the Parties may mutually agree in writing), then, at the
request of either the Shareholder Representative or the Live Oak
Representative, the Unresolved Adjustments will be submitted to Ernst and
Young or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, to a mutually agreed
nationally recognized firm with no material relationships with any
Shareholder, the Shareholder Representative, the Live Oak Representative, or
any of their respective Affiliates and with accounting expertise and relevant
experiences in resolving similar purchase price adjustment disputes (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). Each Party shall submit to the Accounting Firm its
position with respect to the Unresolved Adjustments as set forth in the
Initial Closing Statement, in the case of the Live Oak Representative, and the
Notice of Disagreement, in the case of the Shareholder Representative, and
shall make available to the Accounting Firm the books and records of the
Company, work papers prepared by the Live Oak Representative, the Shareholder
Representative, or their respective Representatives to the extent they relate
to the Initial Closing Statement or the Notice of Disagreement, as the case
may be, and other historical financial information relating to the Initial
Closing Statement, in each case as the Accounting Firm may request. The scope
of the review by the Accounting Firm will be limited to: (i) a disposition of
the Unresolved Adjustments through a strict application of the terms of this
Agreement relating to the calculation of the Merger Consideration; (ii) based
on its determination of the matters described in _clause (i)_ and all items
and amounts that were previously accepted or agreed upon or deemed agreed upon
by the Parties in accordance with this _Section 3.3_ , as applicable, a
calculation of the Merger Consideration, including each of its components;
and (iii) an allocation of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
determined in accordance with the formula specified below in this _Section
3.3(c)_. The Accounting Firm may, at its discretion, conduct a conference
concerning the Unresolved Adjustments, at which conference the Live Oak
Representative and the Shareholder Representative shall have the right to
present additional books and records, work papers, documents, materials, and
other information and to have their respective Representatives present, but
in no event shall either Party or its Representatives have any ex parte
communications or meetings with the Accounting Firm without the prior written
Consent of the other Party. The Accounting Firm is not entitled to, and
the Parties shall not individually request the Accounting Firm to, (A) make
any determination other than as set forth above, (B) determine any Unresolved
Adjustment to be a value higher than the highest value or lower than the
lowest value proposed by the Parties in their submissions to the Accounting
Firm, or (C) undertake any independent investigation of the facts relating to
the Unresolved Adjustments. The Accounting Firm will be instructed to render
its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as
practicable and, if at all possible, within thirty (30) days after such
submission of the Unresolved Adjustments. The determination of the Merger
Consideration by the Accounting Firm will, absent manifest error, be final and
binding on the Parties as the " _Final Merger Consideration_ ," and judgment
may be entered upon such determination in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this
_Section 3.3(c)_ shall be borne by Live Oak, on the one hand, and the
Shareholder Representative, on the other hand, as determined by the Accounting
Firm based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm's
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total value of each
Party's respective position in relation to the total amount of the Unresolved
Balance. For purposes of illustration only, if the Unresolved Balance is One
Hundred Dollars ($100), and the written determination of the Accounting Firm
states that Eighty Dollars ($80) of the Unresolved Balance is resolved in the
Live Oak Representative's favor and Twenty Dollars ($20) of the Unresolved
Balance is resolved in the Shareholder Representative's favor, Live Oak would
bear twenty percent (20%) of the Accounting Firm's costs and expenses, on the
one hand, and the Shareholder Representative would bear eighty percent (80%)
of such costs and expenses, on the other hand. All other fees, expenses, and
costs incurred by a Party or its Representatives in connection with this
_Section 3.3_ shall be borne by such Party.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(d) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
the Final Merger Consideration becomes final and binding pursuant to this
_Section 3.3_ , (i) Live Oak shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the amount
of Live Oak Class A Common Stock required to account for such difference as
calculated in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_ (the " _Positive Adjustment
Shares_ ") and (ii) the Live Oak Representative and the Shareholder
Representative shall jointly instruct Live Oak to transfer to the Exchange
Agent the Adjustment Holdback Shares. Thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall
disburse the Positive Adjustment Shares and the Adjustment Holdback Shares to
the holders of Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares)
in accordance with this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement.

  



  

(e) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
the Final Merger Consideration becomes final and binding pursuant to this
_Section 3.3_ , the Live Oak Representative and the Shareholder
Representative shall jointly instruct Live Oak to deduct out of the Adjustment
Holdback Shares, the number of shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock (the "
_Negative Adjustment Shares_ ") equal to such difference as calculated in
accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_. If the Negative Adjustment Shares is less
than the Adjustment Holdback Shares, then the Live Oak Representative and the
Shareholder Representative shall jointly instruct Live Oak to transfer to the
Exchange Agent the remaining portion of the Adjustment Holdback Shares.
Thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall disburse such remaining portion of the
Adjustment Holdback Amount to the holders of Shares (other than Cancelled
Shares and any Dissenting Shares) in accordance with this Agreement and the
Exchange Agent Agreement. If the Negative Adjustment Shares is greater than
the Adjustment Holdback Shares, and on the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date there remains any funds in the Shareholder Representative
Amount after taking into account and accruing for all expenses and other
amounts for which the Shareholder Representative Amount is permitted to be
used under this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall pay any such
excess amount in the Shareholder Representative Amount to Live Oak within
thirty (30) days following the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum exposure to the Shareholders based on
any adjustments with respect to the Final Merger Consideration and the
Estimated Merger Consideration shall be limited to the Adjustment Holdback
Shares and the remaining funds in the Shareholder Representative Amount.

  



  

(f) The Parties shall treat any consideration received pursuant to this
_Section 3.3_ as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

Section 3.4 _Earn-Out Shares_.

  



  

(a) In addition to the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, Live Oak
shall, upon receipt of written instructions from the Live Oak Representative,
which written instructions the Live Oak Representative agrees to provide upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth below, issue or cause to be issued
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be issued and outstanding unless
or until the following conditions are met) to each Shareholder its "pro rata
portion" of the following contingent merger consideration amounts
(collectively, the " _Earn-Out Shares_ ") subject to the terms and conditions
set forth below:

  



  

(i) two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) shares of Live Oak Class A
Common Stock if the volume weighted average price of Live Oak Class A Common
Stock on the NYSE or such other exchange as such shares may then be listed as
reported on Bloomberg L.P. under the function "VWAP" (or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the Parties) ("
_VWAP_ ") equals or exceeds Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per share for any twenty
(20) trading days within a 30-day trading period beginning on the six (6)
month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date;

  



  

(ii) two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) shares of Live Oak Class A
Common Stock if the VWAP of Live Oak Class A Common Stock on the NYSE or such
other exchange as such shares may then be listed equals or exceeds Twenty
Dollars ($20.00) per share for any twenty (20) trading days within a 30-day
trading period beginning on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date
and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and

  



  

(iii) one million (1,000,000) shares of Live Oak Class A Common Stock if the
VWAP of Live Oak Class A Common Stock on the NYSE or such other exchange as
such shares may then be listed equals or exceeds Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00)
per share for any twenty (20) trading days within a 30-day trading period
beginning on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

(b) The right of a Shareholder to receive any portion of the Earn-Out Shares
hereunder shall be non-transferable, and no Shareholder may transfer, assign,
pledge or convey any interest in the Earn-Out Shares, except by operation of
law.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Live Oak, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld from or with respect to such payment under the Code or other
applicable Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

Indebtedness_.

will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the absence of
footnotes. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
correct in all material respects, have been maintained in accordance with
sound business practices, and accurately reflect in all material respects all
the transactions and actions therein described. At the Closing, all such
books and records will be in the possession of the Company or its applicable

33

 



    



  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any material Liabilities

financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. During the last three (3) years, to the Company's Knowledge,

management or other employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls used by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing.

  



  

(d) The Company applied for and received the PPP Loan under the Paycheck
Protection Program sponsored by the United States Small

for and met all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan at the time of its
application; (ii) has spent the proceeds of the PPP Loan only on eligible
expenses (as described in the applicable SBA regulations); and (iii) is

and will not, be subject to any reductions to loan forgiveness based on a
reduction in the number of employees or a reduction relating to salary and
wages as provided in section 1106(d) of the CARES Act, as amended. The
Company will promptly submit, but in no case later than ten (10) Business Days
following the opening of its lender's portal for such loan forgiveness

_Schedule 4.4(e)_ was obtained through the NMTC Program (collectively, the "
_NMTC Loans_ "). All of the representations made by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries on its application for any NMTC Loans were accurate, complete
and correct in all material respects at the time such representations were
made by the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable. The Company and its
Subsidiaries were eligible for the NMTC Loans at the time of its applications
and have complied with all applicable legal requirements associated with the

of registering, perfecting, prosecuting, and maintaining the foregoing.

  



  

(b) _Schedule 4.8(b)_ sets forth a correct list of all material Contracts
pursuant to which the Company and its Subsidiaries license, as licensor, any
Company Intellectual Property to any other Person (each, an " _Outbound IP
License_ "). The Company has provided to Live Oak a correct copy of each
Outbound IP License, including all amendments, modifications, exhibits, and

Proceeding has been filed against the Company or its Subsidiaries, and
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have received any written or, to the

challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Intellectual
Property or (ii) alleging that the conduct of the Business by the Company or
its Subsidiaries violates, infringes, or misappropriates the Intellectual
Property rights of such Person. The conduct of the Business does not violate,
infringe, or misappropriate, and the conduct of the Business since January 1,
2017 has not violated, infringed, or misappropriated, the Intellectual
Property of any other Person.

  



  

(f) The Company has not performed, nor had performed on its behalf, any
freedom to operate (" _FTO_ ") analyses and would not disclose confidential
product information (including composition information) under an "Attorneys
Eyes Only" designation so that Live Oak could conduct its own FTO analysis.
Instead, the Company performed limited internal assessments of third-
party patents to the extent that such patents may relate to the following
five products: DaniMer 02198 (Film Resin), DaniMer 02251 (PHA Resin), DaniMer
02251B (PHA Resin), DaniMer 02328 (Polyester Resin), and DaniMer 02513 (PHA
Resin) (collectively, the " _Assessed Products_ "). Such assessments were
based solely on the Company conducting its own patent searches utilizing
search terms reasonably determined by the Company to be relevant to the
technology underlying the Assessed Products. The outcome of such
assessments was presented in summary form to Live Oak in which the Company
asserted it did not uncover any third-party patents or pending patent
applications that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Proceedings
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.8(g)_ , to the Company's Knowledge, no
Person has violated, infringed, or misappropriated any of the Company

reduction to practice, or development of any Intellectual Property rights for
or under the direction or supervision of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including any Company Intellectual Property) has executed and delivered to
the Company or its Subsidiaries a valid and enforceable Contract providing for
(i) the non-disclosure by such Person of all confidential information of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) the assignment by such Person (by way of
a present grant of assignment) to the Company or its Subsidiaries of all of
such Person's right, title, and interest in and to such Intellectual Property
rights. To the Company's Knowledge, no Person is in breach of or
default under any such Contract.

(i) _Schedule 4.8(i)_ contains a correct list of the most current embodiment
of each material item of Software included in the Company
Intellectual Property other than commercially available or "shrink wrap"
software (including open source software). The Company and its Subsidiaries
have a valid license or right to use all third-party Software that is required
to operate or modify such Software. To the Company's Knowledge, such Software
performs in all material respects in accordance with the technical
documentation relating thereto. No part of such Software was conceived,
developed, authored, or reduced to practice outside of the United
States. There are no licenses, shop rights, or rights of any other kind held
by any other Person with respect to such Software and no rights in such
Software have otherwise been transferred to any third party. In no instance
has the eligibility of such Software for protection under applicable patent
or copyright Law been forfeited or otherwise reverted to the public domain by
omission of any required notice or any other action. No such Software, or any
no portion thereof, is licensed pursuant to an "open source," "shareware," or
"freeware" license, incorporates or is based on any computer Software that is
licensed pursuant to an "open source," "shareware," or "freeware" license, or
is otherwise distributed for use with any "open source," "shareware," or
"freeware" licensed Software.

  



  

(j) With respect to Company Patents that went abandoned but were then
revived, such abandonment was unintentional and all statements made to the
USPTO and/or other patent offices relating to such abandonment were true and
correct.

transmission, storage, maintenance, organization, presentation, generation,
processing, or analysis of data and information, whether or not in electronic
format, used by the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
IT Systems_ ") have been maintained, in all material respects, by technically
competent personnel, in accordance with standards set by the manufacturers or
otherwise in accordance with prudent industry standards, to ensure proper
operation, monitoring, and use. The Company IT Systems are in good working
condition to effectively perform all information technology operations

other Person has made any illegal or unauthorized use or disclosure of
Personal Data that was collected by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any contractual requirements, privacy policies or other legal
obligations that, as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, would prohibit the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date from receiving or using Personal Data
in substantially the same manner in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
receive and use such Personal Data immediately prior to the Closing.

its ERISA Affiliates or any participant in any Company Benefit Plan that is a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code) may be liable. To the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred,
and no conditions or circumstance exists, that would reasonably be

payments contemplated by the Company Benefit Plans or Contracts in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would,
in the aggregate, constitute excess parachute payments (as defined in Section
280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof)). The Company

notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company

other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
against the Trust Fund are collectively referred to in this _Section 6.14 _

Agreement, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any Claim they may have, now
or in the future, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund for any
reason whatsoever in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing waiver will not limit or prohibit the Company from pursuing a claim
against Live Oak, Merger Sub or any other Person (a) for legal relief against
monies or other assets of Live Oak or Merger Sub held outside of the Trust
Account or for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection
with the Merger or (b) for damages for breach of this Agreement against Live
Oak (or any successor entity) or Merger Sub in the event this Agreement is
terminated for any reason and Live Oak consummates a business combination
transaction with another party. In the event that the Company commences any
action or Proceeding against or involving the Trust Fund in violation of the
foregoing, Live Oak shall be entitled to recover from the Company the
associated reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with any such action,
in the event Live Oak prevails in such action or Proceeding. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall restrict the ability of

not held in the Trust Account.

serve as a fund for the fees and expenses (including any legal fees and
expenses) of, and other amounts payable by, the Shareholder Representative in
connection with this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any balance
of the Shareholder Representative Amount not utilized for such purposes shall
be paid (directly or via the Exchange Agent), when deemed appropriate by the
Shareholder Representative in its sole discretion, to the Shareholders in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. The Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled to recover any remaining fees, expenses, or
other amounts directly from the Shareholders, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Shareholder Representative shall not have any obligation to personally
advance funds in connection with the performance of any of its duties under
this Agreement. By adopting this Agreement, each Shareholder, severally and
not jointly (in accordance with such Shareholder's Percentage Interest),
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder Representative against
all fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) and other amounts
payable or incurred by the Shareholder Representative in connection with the
performance of any of its duties under this Agreement or the Exchange Agent
Agreement, including any such fees, expenses, or other amounts that may be
incurred by the Shareholder Representative in connection with any Proceeding
to which the Shareholder Representative is made a party by reason of the fact
it is or was acting as the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement, to the extent the
Shareholder Representative Amount is insufficient to pay such fees, expenses,
or other amounts.

  



  

Section 10.5   _Exculpation_. The Shareholder Representative will not, by
reason of this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement, have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Shareholder, except in respect of any amounts
received on behalf of such Shareholder. The Shareholder Representative will
not be liable to any Shareholder for any action taken or omitted by it or any
agent employed by it under this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement, or
any other document entered into in connection with this Agreement or the
Exchange Agent Agreement, except that the Shareholder Representative will not
be relieved of any Liability imposed by Law for willful misconduct. The
Shareholder Representative will not be liable to any Shareholder for any
apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Shareholder
Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is
subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any
Shareholder to whom payment was due, but not made, will be to recover from
other Shareholders any payment in excess of the amount to which such other
Shareholders are determined to have been entitled. The Shareholder
Representative will not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of
this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement. Neither the Shareholder
Representative nor any Representative engaged by it will be liable to any
Shareholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Shareholder
Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or relating to the performance of its other duties under this
Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement, except that the Shareholder
Representative will not be relieved of any Liability imposed by Law for fraud
or willful misconduct.

Section 11.18   _No Waiver of Privilege; Protection from Disclosure or Use_.
Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any attorney-
client privilege, work product protection, or other protection from disclosure
or use. The Parties have undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the
disclosure of any information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure or use but, notwithstanding
such efforts, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement could result in the inadvertent disclosure of such information by
one Party to the other Party. The Parties agree that any such inadvertent
disclosure of information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure or use will not constitute
a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or
protection from disclosure, and further agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to return any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing
Party promptly upon becoming aware of its existence. Promptly following the
return of any inadvertently disclosed information, the Party returning such
information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries, descriptions, or
notes of such inadvertently disclosed information, including electronic
versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents or communications that
contain such copies, summaries, descriptions, or notes.

  



  

Section 11.19   _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements
and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and
expire upon the occurrence of the Closing, except for (a) those covenants and
agreements contained herein and therein that by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Closing which shall survive in
accordance with their terms and (b) this _ARTICLE XI_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement is
intended to limit any Party's Liability for such Party's fraud.

  



  

Section 11.20   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which is an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. The delivery of an electronic
signature by means of .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
e-mail, as well as electronic signatures complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN
Act of 2000, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or other applicable Law
(e.g., www.docusign.com), to, or a copy/scan of a manual signature on a
counterpart to, this Agreement by facsimile, email or other electronic
transmission shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party
hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of electronic transmission
by means of .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to e-mail to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was
transmitted or communicated by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment
to e-mail as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such Party
forever waives any such defense.

 _Form of Support Agreement_

  



  

 _See attached._

  



  

   

Ex. A-1

 



    



  

SUPPORT Agreement

  



  

This SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of October 3, 2020,
between Live Oak Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Live Oak_ ")
and [●], [an individual / a [●]] (" _Shareholder_ "). Live Oak and
Shareholder are each sometimes referred to in this Agreement as a " _Party_
," and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used and not
defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Live Oak, Green
Merger Corp., a Georgia corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Live Oak
(" _Merger Sub_ "), Meredian Holdings Group, Inc. (d/b/a Danimer Scientific),
a Georgia corporation (the " _Company_ "), Live Oak Sponsor Partners, LLC, as
representative for certain purposes described in the Merger Agreement, and
John A. Dowdy, Jr., as representative of the shareholders of the Company (the
" _Shareholder Representative_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Live Oak (the " _Merger_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Shareholder is the record or beneficial owner
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, which meaning will apply for all purposes of this Agreement
whenever the term "beneficial owner" or "beneficially own" is used) of the
number of shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (" _Common Stock_ "), of
the Company set forth on the signature page to this Agreement (the "
_Shareholder Shares_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Shareholder Shares will
only include shares of Common Stock outstanding and not any options or
other securities convertible into Common Stock that might otherwise be deemed
to be "beneficially-owned shares" under Rule 13d-3.

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and in consideration of Live Oak's willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and having reviewed the Merger
Agreement and the terms of the proposed Merger, Shareholder has agreed to
enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

Section 1. _Execution of Written Consent; Voting of Shareholder Shares_.

  



  

(a)  Following the execution of this Agreement and no later than ten (10)
Business Days following receipt of written notice from the Company that Live
Oak's Registration Statement on Form S-4 has been declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Shareholder shall execute and deliver to
the Company the Written Consent in the form attached to the Merger
Agreement as Exhibit I, agreeing to vote the Shareholder Shares in favor of
adopting and approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in accordance with the GBCC
and the Organizational Documents of the Company, which consent will become
effective by its terms immediately after the execution of the Merger Agreement
by the parties thereto.

  



  

   

Ex. A-2

 



    



  

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, at any and every meeting of the Shareholders
of the Company, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on
every action or approval by written consent or resolution of the Shareholders
of the Company, Shareholder shall, unless otherwise directed in writing by
Live Oak:

  



  

(i)  appear (in person or by proxy) at any such meeting (or any adjournment
or postponement thereof);

  



  

(ii)  cause the Shareholder Shares to be counted at any such meeting as
present for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

  



  

(iii)  cause the Shareholder Shares to be voted (A) in favor of approval of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (B) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn any meeting to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement if (but only if) there are
not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement on the date on which such
meeting is held, (C) against any Competing Transaction, and (D) against any
action, proposal, transaction, or agreement that could result in a breach of,
inaccuracy in, or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant,
or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of
Shareholder contained in this Agreement or that could prevent, delay, or
adversely affect the consummation of the Merger or the satisfaction of Live
Oak's, Merger Sub's, or the Company's conditions to Closing contained in the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Any Shares that Shareholder acquires after the date of this Agreement,
including by reason of any stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares, or other similar transaction, shall be deemed to be Shareholder Shares
for purposes of this Agreement and shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted
Shareholder Shares on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder
represents and warrants to Live Oak as follows:

  



  

(a)   _Organization and Authorization_. [Shareholder is validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.]1

validly executed and delivered this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes a

valid title to the Shareholder Shares, free and clear of any Lien (other than
restrictions on transfer imposed under applicable securities Laws). Other than
the Shareholder Shares [and as set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto], Shareholder
does not own any Equity Interests of the Company that provide Shareholder with
any voting rights. Shareholder agrees that any shares of Common Stock of the
Company acquired after the date hereof shall be deemed Shareholder Shares for
all purposes of this Agreement, and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
including the voting provisions contained in _Section 1_. There are no
outstanding options, warrants, rights, calls, convertible securities, or other
Contracts obligating Shareholder to transfer or sell or redeem any Equity
Interests of the Company, including the Shareholder Shares. Except for
this Agreement, there are no voting trusts, Shareholder agreements, proxies,
or other Contracts or understandings in effect to which Shareholder is a
party with respect to the voting or transfer of any of the Shareholder Shares.

  



  

(c)   _Governmental Consents; No Conflicts_.

  



  

(i)  The execution, delivery, and performance by Shareholder of this
Agreement, and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, do not and will not require any
Consent of or with any Governmental Authority [or of Shareholder's spouse
under any "community property" or other applicable Law], other than (x) any
consent the failure of which to be obtained would not prevent or delay the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) any consent that is required as a result of any facts or
circumstances relating solely to Live Oak or any of its Affiliates.6

  



  

(ii)  The execution, delivery, and performance by Shareholder of this
Agreement, and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, do not and will not violate,
conflict with, result in a breach, cancellation, or termination
of, constitute a default under, result in the creation of any Lien on any of

Shareholder's properties or assets, including the Shareholder Shares, (B) any
Contract to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder or any of
Shareholder's properties or assets, including the Shareholder Shares, is
bound, [or] (C) any Permit held by Shareholder[, or (D) any of the
Organizational Documents of Shareholder, except, in the case of each of
_clauses (A), (B) and (C)_ , where such violation, conflict, breach,
cancellation, termination, or default would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or delay the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement].7

  



  

(d)   _Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to Shareholder's
knowledge, threatened by or against Shareholder or any of its Affiliates with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or that, if determined adversely to Shareholder, would prevent or delay the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

  



  

This Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is
made as of October 3, 2020, by and between Live Oak Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Live Oak_ "), and [●], [an individual / a [●]]

sometimes referred to in this Agreement as a " _Party_ ," and collectively as
the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below).

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Live Oak, Green

(" _Merger Sub_ "), Meredian Holdings Group, Inc. (d/b/a Danimer Scientific),
a Georgia corporation (the " _Company_ "), Live Oak Sponsor Partners, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, as representative of Live Oak, and John A.
Dowdy, Jr., as representative of the shareholders of the Company (the "
_Shareholder Representative_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Live Oak;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party is a shareholder of the Company;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party will receive a material economic benefit from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party has obtained extensive and valuable knowledge,
trade and other confidential information of the Business; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and in consideration of Live Oak's willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and having reviewed the Merger
Agreement and the terms of the proposed Merger, the Restricted Party has
agreed to enter into this Agreement effective upon the consummation thereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the amounts to be paid by Live Oak to the
Restricted Party under and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

Closing Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the date hereof
(the " _Restricted Period_ "), the Restricted Party shall not directly or
indirectly:

otherwise, participate in, consult or perform services for, render services
in any form to any Person in, or otherwise carry on, whether as principal,

executive, employee, representative or licensor or otherwise, any business
that is competitive with the Business in any geographic area throughout the
world in which the Company and any of its Subsidiaries has conducted
any aspects of the Business during the 12-month period prior to the date
hereof (a " _Competing Business_ ") (it being acknowledged by the Restricted
Party that the Business has been conducted or is proposed to be conducted

indirectly, individually (other than on behalf of Live Oak and its
Subsidiaries) or on behalf of a Competing Business, any customer, vendor,
supplier, licensor, licensee, or other business relation of Live Oak and its
Subsidiaries, or induce or encourage, or attempt to induce or encourage, any

employee, representative, or agent of Live Oak or any of its Subsidiaries who
has been hired or engaged by Live Oak or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries) to leave the employ of Live Oak or any of
its Subsidiaries or (B) hire any such individual.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in _Section 1(a)(i)_ shall
prohibit the Restricted Party from being a passive owner of less than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding Equity Interests of any Person that is

in the business of such Person and (ii) nothing in _Section 1(a)(iii)_
shall prohibit the Restricted Party from (A) making general employment
solicitations, not specifically directed at employees of Live Oak or any of
its Subsidiaries, and hiring any individuals who respond to such
solicitations, or (B) soliciting, recruiting, or hiring any individual who
has not been employed by the Business for at least six (6) months, so long as
the Restricted Party did not have any contact with such individual in
violation of _Section 1(a)(iii)_ prior to the end of such
individual's employment with Live Oak or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 2. _Confidentiality Obligation_. Following the Closing, the
Restricted Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential,
not use and not disclose to any Person any confidential or proprietary
information relating to the Company and the Business conducted by Live Oak
and its Subsidiaries (" _Confidential Information_ "), except to the extent
such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by applicable Law,
in which case the Restricted Party shall (i) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, provide Live Oak with prompt written notice of such
requirement so that Live Oak may seek, at its sole cost and expense,
an appropriate protective order or other remedy or waive compliance, in whole
or in part, with this _Section 2_ , (ii) cooperate with Live Oak, at Live
Oak's sole cost and expense, to obtain such protective order or other remedy,
(iii) disclose only the portion of that information the Restricted Party is
advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and (iv) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of all
information so disclosed.

  



  

   

Ex. C-3

 



    



  

Section 3. _Termination_. This Agreement will automatically terminate if the
Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) this _Section 3_ , _Section 7_ , and
_Section 10_ will survive such termination and (b) no such termination shall
relieve Shareholder from Liability for any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, or intentional or willful breach of this Agreement by the
Restricted Party prior to such termination.

  



  

Section 4. _Reasonableness of Covenants_. The Restricted Party acknowledges
that he or she is sophisticated in business and that the restrictions and
remedies set forth in this Agreement do not create an undue hardship and will
not prevent him or her from earning a livelihood. The Restricted Party
acknowledges that the covenants set forth herein are necessary for the
reasonable, proper, and necessary protection of Live Oak and its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and their legitimate business
interests. Such legitimate business interests include (but are not limited
to) trade secrets, valuable confidential business information that may not
qualify as trade secrets, substantial relationships with numerous existing
and prospective vendors, suppliers or customers, and goodwill associated with
the trade names of the Business and their specific marketing areas. The
Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that each and every one of the
covenants set forth herein is reasonable in respect to scope, subject matter,
length of time and geographic area and are intended to be enforceable to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. Before providing services, whether
as a director, manager, employee, consultant, independent contractor or
otherwise, to any Person during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Party
shall be required to disclose the existence of this Agreement to such Person,
and if requested by such Person, Live Oak and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be permitted to share a complete copy of
this Agreement with such Person or any other Person to which the Restricted
Party performs services. Each of the covenants set forth herein has a unique,
substantial and immeasurable value to Live Oak and its Affiliates (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries). The Restricted Party acknowledges that
Live Oak, in executing the Merger Agreement and the Related Agreements, placed
significant reliance on the Restricted Party's compliance with the covenants
in this Agreement. In the event of any litigation relating to this
Agreement, the prevailing Party as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final non-appealable order shall be entitled to
seek reimbursement from the non-prevailing Party for its reasonable,
documented and out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
fees, incurred in connection with such litigation, including any appeal
therefrom.

  



  

Section 5. _Reformation_. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that any covenant in this Agreement is excessive in duration or scope or is
unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable Law, it is the intention of
the parties hereto that such covenant may be modified or amended by such
court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted
in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect under applicable Law, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or the
enforceability of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6. _Tolling_. In the event of any final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by
the Restricted Party, the Restricted Period shall be extended by a period of
time equal to the period of such breach, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that the running of the Restricted Period shall be tolled and
suspended for the duration of such breach and shall automatically recommence
when such breach if remedied so that Live Oak shall receive the full benefit
of the compliance by the Restricted Party with the provisions of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6_ shall not apply to
any period for which Live Oak is awarded and receives actual monetary damages
for breach by the Restricted Party of any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement with respect to which this _Section 6_ applies.

  



  

   

Ex. C-4

 



    



  

Section 7. _Remedies; Equitable Relief_. The Restricted Party agrees that
this Agreement shall be enforced independently of any obligations
between Live Oak and the Company under the Merger Agreement and the Related
Agreements, and that the existence of any claim or defense under such other
agreements shall not affect the enforceability of the provisions of this
Agreement or the remedies provided herein. The Restricted Party acknowledges
that (a) money damages may be an insufficient or inadequate remedy for any
actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by it, (b) any such breach may
cause Live Oak irreparable harm, and (c) in addition to any other
remedies available at law or in equity, Live Oak will be entitled to seek
equitable relief by way of injunction, specific performance, or otherwise,
without showing of actual damages or posting any bond or other undertaking,
for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Restricted
Party, and the exercise of one right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of
any other right or remedy. The exercise of any right or remedy will be
without prejudice to the right to exercise any other right or remedy provided
in this Agreement, by law or in equity.

  



  

Section 8. _Representations and Warranties_. Each Party represents and
warrants to the other Party that: (a) it, he or she has all necessary right,
title and authority to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement constitutes valid and
binding obligations of such Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and limitations on the availability of equitable remedies;
and (c) the execution and delivery by such Party of this Agreement and the
performance of and compliance with the terms hereof by such Party does not
and will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions
or provisions of, (ii) constitute a default under, (iii) result in the
creation of any lien, security interest, charge, or encumbrance upon such
Party's assets pursuant to, (iv) give any third party the right to modify,
terminate, or accelerate any obligation under, (v) result in a violation of,

Affiliates is subject.

  



  

Section 9. _Acknowledgment of Voluntary Agreement_. The Restricted Party has
entered into this Agreement freely and without coercion. The Restricted
Party has been advised by Live Oak to consult with counsel of the Restricted
Party's choice with regard to the execution of this Agreement and the
Restricted Party's covenants hereunder. The Restricted Party has had an
adequate opportunity to consult with counsel and such other legal, financial,
technical or other experts as the Restricted Party deems necessary or
desirable and either so consulted or freely determined in the Restricted
Party's own discretion not to so consult with such counsel or other experts.

fully and completely understands this Agreement and each of the Restricted
Party's representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements
hereunder. This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed as having been
