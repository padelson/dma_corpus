Transfers by the Sellers and their Affiliates. (a) Purchase and Sale of the
Shares and the Venture Interests. On the Closing Date and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Stock Sellers will
sell, convey, assign and transfer to the applicable Buyers set forth in
Schedule F, and the applicable Buyers set forth in Schedule F will purchase
and acquire, all of such Stock Sellers\' right, title and interest in and to
the Shares and Venture Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than Permitted Encumbrances and other than such as may be created by or on
behalf of the Buyers; provided, however, that with respect to the Nadella
Shares and the Torrington France Shares, the purchase and sale thereof shall
be effected exclusively in accordance with Section 5.22 and with the terms of
the French Offer Letter and (ii) the other Venture Interests will be
indirectly acquired by virtue of the sale and conveyance of the Shares.  
(b) Purchase and Sale of the Separate Assets. On the Closing Date and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the applicable
Buyers set forth in Schedule F shall purchase and acquire from the Asset
Sellers, and the Asset Sellers shall sell, convey, assign and transfer to the
applicable Buyers, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances and other than such as may be created by or on behalf of the
Buyers, all those assets described in Schedule E wherever situated
and principally used in or held for use in the Business by the indicated
Asset Seller, as the same shall exist on the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Separate Assets"). Except for the Separate Assets, the Asset Sellers
will retain all other assets, properties, rights and interests owned, used or
held by the Asset Sellers. For the purpose of this Agreement, (i) all
references to the Business shall be deemed to include the Separate Assets and
(ii) as of the date of this Agreement (but not the Closing Date), (A) the  
-12-   Separate Assets shall be deemed to include the assets of Ingersoll-
Rand Canada, Inc. set forth in Schedule E, and (B) the Asset Sellers shall
be deemed to include Ingersoll-Rand Canada, Inc.   2.2 Assumption of
Liabilities. (a) Without limiting either (i) the Liabilities of the Sold
Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities or (ii) the assumption
by the Buyers of any Liabilities expressly assumed pursuant to this
Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, the applicable Buyers shall assume, and shall
thereafter pay, perform and discharge as and when due (x) all Liabilities of
the respective Asset Sellers set forth on Schedule E attributable to the
Business and (y) all Liabilities of IR and its Affiliates under the Material
Contracts set forth in Schedule 3.15(a), (the foregoing Liabilities, the
"Assumed Liabilities").   (b) Except as expressly provided in Section
2.2(a), the Buyers shall not assume, and shall not have been deemed to
assume, any Liability of the Asset Sellers arising out of, relating to, or
incurred in connection with the conduct of the Business or relating to the
Separate Assets (such Liabilities of the Asset Sellers, other than those
constituting the Assumed Liabilities, the "Excluded Liabilities").   2.3
Consideration. (a) On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, in reliance on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein and in
consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares, the Venture
Interests and the Separate Assets, Timken, on behalf of the Buyers, will on
the Closing Date:   (i) pay to the Sellers $700,000,000 (as adjusted
pursuant to  Section 2.6, the "Cash Consideration");   (ii) issue to IRNJ
that number of shares (the "Share  Consideration") of common stock, without
par value, of Timken (the  "Timken Common Stock") equal to the quotient of
(x) $140 million divided  by (y) the Price Per Share; and   (iii) assume
the Assumed Liabilities.   (b) [Intentionally omitted]   (c) The Cash
Consideration and the Share Consideration (collectively, as adjusted pursuant
to this Agreement, the "Purchase Price") shall be allocated among the Sellers
as set forth on Schedule 2.3 (the "Section 2.3(c)(i) Allocation"). The Buyers
and the Sellers agree that the amount of Purchase Price allocable to the Sold
Companies, Separate Assets or Venture Interests, which allocation shall be
set forth in dollar amounts on Schedule 2.3 (the "Section 2.3(c)(ii)
Allocation"), shall in each case be equal to the fair market value of the
relevant Sold Companies, Separate Assets or Venture Interests, as applicable,
determined after giving effect to the Restructuring; provided, that the
amounts shown on the Section 2.3(c)(ii) Allocation shall be adjusted prior to
the Closing to reflect any changes in the net book value of any of the Sold
Companies, Separate Assets or Venture Interests (except for Industrias del
Rodamiento S.A., NSULC, Torrington and the Separate Assets of Ingersoll-Rand
Company Limited (Technology Branch) set forth on Schedule E) during the
period beginning on December   -13-   31, 2001 and ending at the Closing
and a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the amount shown on the
Section 2.3(c)(ii) Allocation for Torrington.   (d) The Buyers shall
withhold from the Purchase Price (i) any and all amounts equal to any
withholding Tax owed to any Taxing Authority as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) an amount equal to any U.S. state Tax
owed for periods ending on or prior to the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date that, if not withheld, would cause the Buyers to be successors
to any Tax (a "Withheld Amount"). If any Buyer computes an amount of Tax owed
to any Taxing Authority for which it desires to withhold, such Buyer shall
provide to the Sellers a schedule detailing the amount of Tax due in each
jurisdiction and such Buyer and the Sellers must both agree on the amount
properly owed before such Buyer may withhold any such Taxes. If the
applicable Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree on a Withheld Amount,
they shall request a nationally recognized accounting firm to provide an
opinion on the Withheld Amount and such opinion shall be determinative. If,
subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.3(d), any Buyer withholds
any amount from the Purchase Price, such Buyer agrees to pay over to the
applicable Taxing Authority the amount required to be withheld, and to
promptly deliver to the Sellers any withheld amounts remaining thereafter in
such Buyer\'s custody (including, without limitation, any withheld amounts
subsequently refunded to such Buyer). IR shall be responsible for the
appointment of a Tax representative in France in relation to the sale of
Nadella and will provide the Buyer with satisfactory evidence that such
Tax representative has been formally accepted by the French Tax
Authorities; provided that all costs and expenses of such Tax representative
shall be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on
the other hand.   2.4 The Closing. (a) Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLES VI and VII, the closing (the
"Closing") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at the offices of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, 222 East 41st Street, New
York, New York 10017, not later than on the third Business Day following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 7.7, or if
the conditions set forth in Section 6.4 and 7.4 are not satisfied on such
date, on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in 6.4 and 7.4 hereof (the "Closing Date"), or at such
other place and time as may be agreed upon by the Sellers and the Buyers.  
(b) If, on the Closing Date, (i) (A) any Seller or applicable Buyer has not
obtained any Governmental Approval or other Consent required in order to
transfer (directly or indirectly) any Shares or Venture Interests
in Industria Cuscinetti S.p.A. or Torrington Wuxi Bearings Company
Limited (collectively, the "Deferred Items"), and (B) the conditions
precedent to the Closing have been satisfied or waived or (ii) there is in
effect any injunction, restraining order or decree of any nature of any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or any Law or Governmental
Order that restrains or prohibits the transfer to the applicable Buyer of any
of the Deferred Items (but not any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby) that is not permanent and non-appealable (a "Non-Final Injunction"),
such Deferred Items shall be withheld from sale without any reduction in
the Purchase Price. From and after the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyers
shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all Governmental
Approvals and Consents relating to the Deferred Items or the transfer  
-14-   thereof, and/or to cause all Non-Final Injunctions relating to the
Deferred Items or the transfer thereof to be lifted.   (c) Until such time
as any Deferred Items have been transferred to the applicable Buyer pursuant
to Section 2.4(d) (each, a "Deferred Transfer"), the Deferred Items shall be
held for such Buyer\'s benefit and shall be managed and operated by the
Sellers for such Buyer\'s benefit and account from the Closing to the time of
the respective Deferred Transfers, with all gains, income, losses, taxes or
other items generated thereby to be for such Buyer\'s account. IR and its
Affiliates shall have no Liability to any Buyer arising out of the management
or operation of Deferred Items other than for negligence or willful
misconduct, for which negligence or willful misconduct IR and its Affiliates
will indemnify the Buyers; provided, that IR and its Affiliates will have no
Liability for actions taken in accordance with the request or direction of
Timken or its Affiliates. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Buyers shall reimburse the Sellers and shall hold the Sellers
harmless from and against all Liabilities, incurred or asserted as a result
of the Sellers\' post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or
operation of the Deferred Items, including, without limitation, the amount of
any additional Taxes payable by the Sellers (whether currently or in the
future), after application of the terms of this Agreement, as a result
thereof in excess of the amount of Taxes which would have been payable by the
Sellers, after application of the terms of this Agreement, if the Deferred
Items had been transferred to the applicable Buyer on the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall reimburse the applicable
Buyers and hold them harmless from and against any additional Taxes payable
by such Buyers (whether currently or in the future), after application of the
terms of this Agreement, as a result of such Buyers being denied the use of a
loss, deduction or Tax credit generated with respect to the Deferred Items
because of the Sellers\' post-Closing direct or indirect ownership,
management or operation of the Deferred Items. Any claim made against the
Buyers by any Taxing Authority that would result in a payment pursuant tot he
immediately preceding sentence shall be treated as a Tax Claim and be subject
to Section 5.6.   (d) The closing of a transfer of any Deferred Item shall
be effected on the fifth Business Day after receipt of all necessary Consents
and Approvals, or at such other time as the parties may agree, and shall
be effective upon the execution and delivery of all Transaction
Agreements required under Law to effect such transfer.   (e) If the Closing
of the transfer of any Deferred Item shall not have occurred prior to the
18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) all obligations of the parties
with respect to the sale of such Deferred Item and all other Liabilities
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Deferred Item (other than the
indemnities referred to in clause (c) above) shall be terminated, (ii) IR and
its Affiliates shall retain such Deferred Item and (iii) IR shall pay to
Timken on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date the amount set forth
in the Section 2.3(a)(ii) Allocation with respect to such Deferred Item, plus
interest thereon at the Prime Rate for the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the date of payment.   2.5 Deliveries at the Closing. (a)
At or prior to the Closing, IR shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each
of the respective Buyers:   -15-    (i) stock certificates (or local
legal equivalent)  evidencing the Shares and/or the Venture Interests to be
sold by each  Stock Seller, duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock

stamps  affixed;   (ii) a receipt from each Seller for the portion of the 
Purchase Price paid to such Seller, as the case may be;   (iii) the
Transaction Agreements to which each Seller is  a party, duly executed by
each relevant Seller;   (iv) copies of the resolutions (or local equivalent)
of the  boards of directors and, where required, the stockholders of each
Seller,  authorizing and approving this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements  and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, certified
by the  respective corporate secretaries (or local equivalent) of the
applicable  Sellers to be true and complete and in full force and effect
and  unmodified as of the Closing Date;   (v) the Consents listed on
Schedule 2.5(a)(v); and   (vi) the certificates required by Section 7.3.  
(b) At or prior to the Closing, Timken shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to each of the respective Sellers the following:   (i) the Cash
Consideration by wire transfer of  immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by IR to  Timken not less than two Business Days prior
to the Closing;   (ii) stock certificates evidencing the Share 
Consideration in the denominations and duly registered in the name(s) 
specified by IR;   (iii) a receipt evidencing the applicable Buyer\'s
receipt  of the Shares, the Separate Assets and the Venture Interests;  
(iv) copies of the resolutions of the board of directors  of each Buyer
authorizing and approving this Agreement and all other  transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby, certified by the  corporate secretary of each
Buyer to be true and complete and in full  force and effect and unmodified as
of the Closing Date;   (v) the Transaction Agreements to which Timken or
other  applicable Buyer is a party, duly executed by Timken or such other
Buyer;   (vi) the Consents listed on Schedule 2.5(b)(vi); and   (vii) the
certificate required by Section 6.3.   -16-    2.6 Purchase Price
Adjustment. (a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, on behalf of IR, will prepare, or cause to be prepared, the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement. The Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be
prepared on a combined basis in accordance with GAAP (subject to the
exceptions described in Schedule 2.6(a)), applied on a basis consistent with
the Audited Financial Statements and, except as set forth on Schedule 2.6(a),
prepared on a basis consistent with, and reflecting, all adjustments
reflected on the Benchmark Net Working Capital Statement and eliminating the
effect of currency fluctuations since December 31, 2001. At the same time,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, on behalf of IR, will prepare, or cause to be
prepared, a statement containing a calculation of the Net Debt (the "Net Debt
Statement"), which shall be prepared in accordance with the definition of Net
Debt. "Net Debt" shall mean the excess of Debt Obligations identified on
Schedule 5.25 over the Cash of the Business after giving effect to the
Restructuring as of 12:01 A.M. (local time) on the Closing Date, determined
on a combined basis in accordance with GAAP (subject to the exceptions
described in Schedule 2.6(a)), applied on a basis consistent with the Audited
Financial Statements; provided that with respect to Torrington Wuxi Bearings
Company Limited, for purposes of calculating Net Debt, (i) Debt Obligations
shall be equal to the product of (x) the Debt Obligations of Torrington Wuxi
Bearings Company Limited multiplied by (y) 78% and (ii) Cash shall be equal
to the product of (x) the Cash of Torrington Wuxi Bearings Company Limited
multiplied by (y) 78%. Timken will assist and cooperate with IR in the
preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Debt
Statement, including by providing IR and its accountants reasonable access to
the books and records of the Business and to any other information reasonably
necessary to prepare the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Net
Debt Statement.   (b) Timken shall, within 30 days after the delivery by IR
of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Debt Statement,
complete its review of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Net
Debt Statement. Timken and its accountants shall be provided with reasonable
access to the workpapers of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in connection with
such review. In the event that Timken determines that either of the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement or the Net Debt Statement has not been prepared
on a basis consistent with the requirements of Section 2.6(a), Timken shall,
on or before the last day of such 30-day period, inform IR in writing
(the "Objection"), setting forth a specific description of the basis of
the Objection, the adjustments to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
or the Net Debt Statement which Timken believes should be made, and
Timken\'s calculation of the Net Working Capital or Net Debt, as the case may
be, and Timken shall be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically
disputed in the Objection. Failure to so notify IR shall constitute
acceptance and approval of IR\'s calculation of the Net Working Capital and
Net Debt. The parties agree that, to the extent either party elects to
conduct a physical count of the inventory of the Business following the date
of this Agreement (such physical count to be performed on a basis consistent
with the basis employed in connection with the preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements), the other party and its independent accountants shall
have the right to be present at such inventory and, unless the observing
party objects to the method of conducting such inventory, the physical count
obtained at such inventory shall be used for purposes of determining the Net
Working Capital.   (c) (i) Subject to Section 2.6(f), if the Net Working
Capital  calculated by Timken and the Net Working Capital calculated by IR 
are both less than the Net Working Capital   -17-    Base Amount, the
Sellers shall pay an amount in cash equal to the  sum of (x) the amount of
the deficiency between the Net Working  Capital Base Amount and the Net
Working Capital calculated by IR  plus (y) interest on the amount paid
computed at the rate declared  from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank at
its "base rate" (based  on a 365-day year) (the "Prime Rate") for the period
from the  Closing Date to the date of such payment, in immediately
available  funds to the Buyers no later than the third Business Day
following  IR\'s receipt of Timken\'s Objection. If the Net Working Capital 
calculated by Timken and the Net Working Capital calculated by IR  are both
greater than the Net Working Capital Base Amount, the  Buyers shall pay the
Sellers an amount in cash equal to the sum of  (x) the amount of the excess
of the Net Working Capital calculated  by Timken over the Net Working Capital
Base Amount plus (y) interest  on the amount paid computed at the Prime Rate
for the period from  the Closing Date to the date of such payment, in
immediately  available funds to the Sellers no later than the third Business
Day  following IR\'s receipt of Timken\'s Objection.   (ii) Subject to
Section 2.6(f), if the Net Debt calculated by Timken  and the Net Debt
calculated by IR are both negative (i.e., Cash  exceeds Debt Obligations),
the Buyers shall pay an amount in cash  equal to the sum of (x) the amount of
the Net Debt calculated by  Timken plus (y) interest on the amount paid
computed at the Prime  Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the date
of such  payment, in immediately available funds to the Sellers no later
than  the third Business Day following IR\'s receipt of Timken\'s
Objection.  If the Net Debt calculated by Timken and the Net Debt calculated
by  IR are positive (i.e., Cash is less than Debt Obligations), the  Sellers
shall pay an amount in cash equal to the sum of (x) the  amount of the Net
Debt calculated by IR plus (y) interest on the  amount paid computed at the
Prime Rate for the period from the  Closing Date to the date of such payment,
in immediately available  funds to Timken no later than the third Business
Day following IR\'s  receipt of Timken\'s Objection.   (d) IR shall then
have 30 days following the date it receives the Objection to review and
respond to the Objection. If IR and Timken are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing items by the
30th day following IR\'s response thereto, after having used their good faith
efforts to reach a resolution, they shall refer their remaining differences
to Deloitte and Touche LLP or another internationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants as to which IR and Timken mutually agree (the
"CPA Firm"), who shall, acting as experts in accounting and not as
arbitrators, determine on a basis consistent with the requirements of Section
2.6(a), and only with respect to the specific remaining accounting related
differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Net

Working Capital contained in the Final Statement of Net  Working Capital is
less than the Net Working Capital Base Amount, the  Sellers shall pay an
amount in cash equal to the difference of (x) the  amount of such deficiency,
minus (y) any amounts paid by the Sellers to  the Buyers pursuant to Section
2.6(c) (such difference, the "Remaining  Net Working Capital Deficiency"),
plus (z) interest on the amount paid  computed at the Prime Rate for the
period from the Closing Date to the  date of such payment. Such payment shall

Buyers or the Sellers, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 2.6(c) or
2.6(e), as the case may be, shall be netted against all amounts payable to
such party by the other party pursuant to such Section.   (g) Any amounts
payable to or from the Sellers under this Section 2.6 shall be paid pro rata
among the Sellers based on the portion of the Purchase Price paid to each of
the Sellers. The Buyers and the Sellers agree to treat any amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.6 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   (h)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6, in the event
that any assets or businesses of the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries or
any Separate Assets are divested or sold pursuant to Section 5.23(b) in one
or more transactions that, had such transactions occurred prior to December
31, 2001, would have impacted the Benchmark Net Working Capital Statement and
the Net Working Capital Base Amount, then the Benchmark Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Base Amount shall each be adjusted to
give effect to such divestiture or sale as if such divestiture or sale
occurred prior to December 31, 2001. In such event, all calculations pursuant
to this Section 2.6 shall be effected utilizing such adjusted Benchmark Net
Working Capital Statement and adjusted Net Working Capital Base Amount.  
(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the net present value
of the depreciation deductions (the "Tax Benefit") allowable under Canadian
Tax Law with respect to the assets of NSULC listed on Schedule 2.6(i) (the
"Buildings"), calculated as follows: (i) the Buildings will be deemed to
be depreciated on a basis consistent with Canadian Tax Law; (ii) the
depreciable basis in the Buildings shall be deemed to be an amount equal to
the difference between the fair market value of the Buildings (the "Fair
Market Value") and NSULC\'s Tax basis in the Buildings as of the Closing
Date; and (iii) the effective Tax rate of NSULC shall be deemed to be the
actual combined effective Tax rate (taking into account Canadian federal,
provincial and local Taxes) of Ingersoll-Rand Canada, Inc. as of the Closing
Date. The net present value of the Tax Benefit shall be calculated by
discounting the amount of the Tax Benefit, as determined pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, back to the Closing Date, using a discount
rate of 10%. Within 30 days of the Closing Date, the Buyers shall, at their
sole cost and expense, select a nationally recognized independent appraisal
firm to conduct an appraisal of the Buildings (the "Buyer Appraisal") to
determine its Fair Market Value. The determination of Fair Market Value set
forth in the Buyer Appraisal shall be final unless the Sellers object to the
Buyer Appraisal within 15 days of their receipt thereof, in which case the
Sellers shall have 30 days from the date of such objection to select,
at their sole cost and expense, a nationally recognized independent firm to
conduct an appraisal of the Buildings (the "Seller Appraisal") to determine
its Fair Market Value. The determination of Fair Market Value set forth in
the Seller Appraisal shall be final unless the Buyers object to the Seller
Appraisal within 15 days of their receipt thereof, in which case the Buyers
and the Sellers shall mutually agree on a nationally recognized independent
firm to conduct an appraisal of the Buildings (the "Joint Appraisal") to
determine its Fair Market   -20-   Value. The determination of Fair
Market Value set forth in the Joint Appraisal shall be final and binding on
the parties for purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Benefit.

applicable, of the Code has received a favorable determination letter as to
its qualification, and to the Knowledge of the Buyers, nothing has occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such determination,
except   -40-   where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.   (b) There are no

available to IR a summary of all material insurance policies covering the
assets and operations of Timken and its subsidiaries as of the date hereof,
specifying the insurer, amount of coverage and type of insurance. Except as

approved, for the purposes of Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code, this
Agreement, the Transaction Agreements, the issuance of shares of the Timken
Common Stock pursuant hereto and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable the
provisions of ss.1704.02 of the Ohio Revised Code to all such transactions
and to all future transactions between IRNJ and Timken if, as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, IRNJ becomes an "interested shareholder" as
defined therein, and in such event, until such time as IRNJ is no longer an
"interested shareholder".   4.19 Investment Intent. Each Buyer who is
acquiring Shares or Venture Interests is acquiring such Shares or Venture

transfer any of the Shares or Venture Interests, except in compliance with
the Securities Act. Each of the Buyers further understands and acknowledges
that the Shares and the Venture Interests have not been registered under the
Securities Act and agrees that neither the Shares nor the Venture Interests
may be transferred unless (a) such transfer is pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or (b) such transfer is
exempt from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.   4.20
Ability to Bear Risk. The financial situation of each Buyer who is acquiring

economic risk of holding such Shares or Venture Interests for an indefinite
period and (b) it can afford to suffer the complete loss of its investment in
such Shares or Venture Interests.   4.21 No Other Representations or

respect to Taxes of the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries, Separate Assets and
Venture Entities, including any agreements or arrangements relating to
intercompany services and transactions that have been entered into between or
among any of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities.
The Sellers shall respond to the requests set forth in the Tax Diligence
Schedule no later than thirty (30) days after the date they receive the Tax
Diligence Schedule; provided, that the Sellers shall not be obligated to
provide Timken with any information relating to Taxes that is requested in
the Tax Diligence Schedule if such information (i) relates to taxable periods
prior to 1999 or (ii) relates solely to Taxes of the Sellers or their
Affiliates other than the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries or Venture Entities.
If the information relating to Taxes that is requested by Timken relates
partially to Taxes of the Sellers or their Affiliates other than the Sold
Companies, Subsidiaries or Venture Entities (including, without limitation,
any affiliated, consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return or related
filing), the Sellers shall provide the Buyers pro forma or redacted portions
of such information pertaining solely to Taxes of the Sold
Companies, Subsidiaries or Venture Entities. This Section shall not relieve
Sellers of their obligation to transfer possession of books and records
pursuant to Section 5.2(a). The Buyers and the Sellers agree to cooperate
with one another and to act in good faith in preparing and responding to the
Tax Diligence Schedule.   -47-    (e) The parties agree that the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All
information obtained by the Buyers and their respective counsel, accountants

by Law, each of the Sellers hereby agrees that it shall, and shall cause its
respective officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents to, hold in
confidence all non-public information acquired from Buyers pursuant to this
Section 5.2 to the same extent as the Buyers are required to do so with
respect to information received by Buyers pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement.   (f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Buyers a
reasonably complete list of all Permits held by or in the name of any Asset
Seller with respect to the Business.   5.3 Section 338 Election. (a) The
Buyers may, in their discretion, make any election under Section 338(g) of
the Code with respect to any of the non-U.S. Sold Companies or their non-U.S.
Subsidiaries. The Buyers shall notify the Sellers of any such election at
least 30 days prior to the filing of such election.   (b) With respect to
the Stock Sellers\' sale of the Shares to the Buyers, the Stock Sellers and
the Buyers shall, where permissible, jointly make timely, effective and
irrevocable elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, if permissible, similar elections
under any applicable state or local income tax Laws (the "Elections"), and
file the Elections in accordance with applicable regulations. The Buyers, the
Stock Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries shall report the
transaction consistent with such Elections and agree not to take any action
that could cause such Elections to be invalid, and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination (as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) or any similar state or local Tax
provision. The Stock Sellers shall bear the responsibility for payment of any
federal, state, local or foreign Tax attributable to making the Elections,
and shall promptly reimburse the Buyers, the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries to the extent any of the Buyers, the Sold Companies or
the Subsidiaries incur any Tax Liability arising from such Election,
including any state or local Tax Liability attributable to a deemed election
under Section 338(g) of the Code.   (c) To the extent possible, the Buyers,
the Stock Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries shall execute at
the Closing any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Elections
(including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under
applicable state and local income tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms")). In the
event, however, any Section 338 Forms are not executed at the Closing, the
Buyers, the Stock Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries shall
prepare and complete each such Section 338 Form no later than 15 days prior
to the date such Section 338 Form is required to be filed. The Buyers, the
Stock Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries shall each cause the
Section 338 Forms to be duly executed by an authorized person for the Buyers,
the Stock Sellers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries in each case, and
shall duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms in accordance with
applicable tax laws and the terms of this Agreement.   -48-    (d) The
Buyers shall prepare a schedule setting forth the fair market value of the
assets of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries and the allocation of the
aggregate deemed sales price of the assets of the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries resulting from the elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) (the "Section 338 Allocation") and shall
deliver such Section 338 Allocation to the Sellers for their review within
170 days after the Closing Date. The Section 338 Allocation shall be prepared
in accordance with the rules under Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyers and the Sellers agree
that in preparing the Section 338 Allocation, no portion of the aggregate
deemed sales price of the assets of the Business resulting from the Elections
shall be allocated to the CDO Payment Rights. The Sellers shall have thirty
(30) days to review and comment on the Section 338 Allocation prepared by the
Buyers; provided, that if the Buyers deliver the Section 338 Allocation to
the Sellers prior to the 170th day following the Closing Date, such period of
review and comment shall extend to the 200th day following the Closing Date
(the "Review Period"). If the Sellers and the Buyers are unable to agree on
the Section 338 Allocation during the Review Period, they shall request a
nationally recognized accounting firm to prepare such Section 338 Allocation
(subject to the limitation contained in the immediately preceding sentence).
The cost of any such firm shall be borne equally by the Buyers, on one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other. In the event the Section 338 Allocation is
audited or disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice
thereof shall promptly notify the other party hereto. If such an audit or
dispute arises in connection with a Tax Claim or in connection with an audit
or proceeding relating to a Seller\'s Tax Return, the Sellers shall, at their
own expense, control all proceedings taken in connection with such audit or
dispute (including selection of counsel and accountants) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, audits and conferences
with any Taxing Authority in connection therewith, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 5.3(d). The Buyers shall, at their own expense,
control all other audits or disputes in connection with any Section 338
Allocation (including selection of counsel and accountants) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, audits and conferences
with any Taxing Authority in connection therewith, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 5.3(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the party
controlling the audit or dispute shall (A) consult with the other party prior
to taking any action in connection with such audit or dispute that
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such other
party and (B) not take any action in connection with such audit or dispute
that would legally bind the other party without the prior written consent of
such other party and (ii) each of the Buyers and the Sellers shall (A) be
bound by the Section 338 Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes,
(B) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with the Section 338 Allocation, and (C) take
no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with
the Section 338 Allocation on any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any
audit, dispute or proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise with
respect to such Tax Returns.   5.4 Tax Matters; Cooperation; Preparation of
Returns; Tax Elections. (a) The Buyers and the Sellers agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance (including, at the expense of
the requesting party, reasonable access to the other party\'s Tax Return
preparer, provided that such other party may limit such access as is it deems
necessary to protect confidential information)   -49-   relating to the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or Venture Entities (but, in the case of a
Venture Entity, only to the extent the Sellers have reasonable access to such
information or assistance under the applicable agreement(s) governing such
Venture Entity) (including access to books and records, employees,
contractors and representatives) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of
all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation
for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Each of the Buyers and
the Sellers agrees that it shall (i) consult with the other party prior to
taking any position or settling any claim with respect to Taxes that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such other party
and (ii) not take any action with respect to Taxes that would legally bind
the other party without the prior written consent of such other party. The
Buyers and the Sellers shall retain all books and records with respect to
Taxes which are indemnifiable under Section 5.5(a) and pertain to the Sold
Companies, the Subsidiaries and Venture Entities (but, in the case of a
Venture Entity, only to the extent the Sellers have reasonable access to such
information or assistance under the applicable agreement(s) governing such
Venture Entity) until the expiration of all relevant statutes of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by the Buyers and the Sellers, any extensions
thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall provide the other with
at least ten days prior written notice before destroying any such books and
records, during which period the party receiving such notice can elect to
take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.   (b) The
Sellers shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of any of the Stock Sellers, Sold
Companies, Subsidiaries or Separate Assets (including any affiliated,
consolidated, unitary and combined Tax Returns, which include the operations
of any of these entities or any Tax Returns for Venture Entities that the
Sellers are responsible for filing) for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date. The party that is legally required to file a
Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for preparing
and timely filing such Tax Return. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return and in
accordance with Law. The Sellers shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing
Authority all Taxes due in connection with any such Tax Returns. The Buyers
shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
other Tax Returns in respect of the Sold Companies and any of the
Subsidiaries, including for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date
which begins before the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). The Buyers shall
provide IR with a copy of each proposed Straddle Period Tax Return (and such
additional information regarding such Straddle Period Tax Return as may
reasonably be requested by IR) for its approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (i) at least 15 days prior to the filing of
such Tax Return or (ii) in the case of a Tax Return that is required to be
filed within 20 days of the Closing Date, at least ten days prior to the date
such Tax Return is required to be filed; provided, that in the case of a Tax
Return that is required to be filed within 10 days of the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to afford IR a reasonable
opportunity to review and approve such Straddle Period Tax Return prior to
filing such Tax Return. Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed by the Buyers
for a Straddle Period shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last
previous similar Tax Return; provided, that if after consultation with the
Sellers the Buyers reasonably determine that they are required by Law to
prepare any Tax Return for a Straddle Period on a basis inconsistent with the
last previous similar Tax Return, then they shall so notify the Sellers,
subject to the requirements of this Section 5.4(b).   -50-    (c) All
transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other such Taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes, but excluding any Taxes
based on or attributable to income or gains) and related fees (including any
penalties, interest and additions to Tax) ("Transfer Taxes") arising out of
or incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne equally by the
Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.   (d) All Tax
sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the
Business shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, the Buyers and their Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any
Liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or
before the Closing Date.   5.5 Tax Indemnity. (a) The Sellers shall
indemnify and defend the Buyers and their Affiliates (including the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries) and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents and hold them harmless against all Losses
that any such party may incur or suffer (i) for federal, state, local and
foreign income, franchise or similar Taxes (including any Loss for Tax of the
Sold Companies, Subsidiaries, Venture Entities (but only to the extent of the
Sellers\' direct Liability for Taxes of such Venture Entity, including joint
and several Liability) and Separate Assets under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) ("Income
Taxes") and all Taxes other than Income Taxes ("Other Taxes") of the Sold
Companies, Subsidiaries, Venture Entities (but only to the extent of the
Sellers\' direct Liability for Taxes of such Venture Entity, including joint
and several Liability) and Separate Assets, in each case for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period that begins before the Closing Date and ends on the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Straddle Period"); provided, that in the case of any U.S. state
in which Taxes for any taxable period are based on or measured by income,
receipts, or profits earned in any prior taxable period or portion thereof
preceding the Closing Date, the taxable period for purposes of this Section
5.5(a) shall be deemed to include any such prior taxable period or portion
thereof, (ii) for any breach of the Sellers\' representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.11 and, solely as they relate to entity classification
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Sections 3.3 and 3.4, (iii) for
federal, state, local and foreign Taxes arising as a result of Torrington\'s
receipt or payment of those amounts in respect of the CDO Payment Rights that
are payable to IRNJ pursuant to Section 5.17, (iv) arising out of or incident
to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax imposed on or as a
result of the transactions described in that certain prospectus of IR, filed
with the Commission on November 2, 2001 (Registration No. 333-71642), (v)
arising out of or incidental to the imposition, assessment or assertion of
any Tax imposed on or as a result of the Restructuring and (vi) arising out
of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax
described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above.   (b) For purposes
of Section 5.4 and this Section 5.5, the portion of such Tax related to a
Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes (including
French local business Taxes (taxe professionelle)) other than Taxes arising
under Section 179 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Taxes arising
as a result of the transactions contemplated under the Restructuring, gross
receipts, sales or use taxes, valued-added taxes, employment taxes and any
Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a
Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the   -51-   denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the
case of any sales or use taxes, valued added taxes, employment taxes and any
Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a
Straddle Period (including, without limitation, Taxes arising under Section
179 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Taxes arising as a result
of the transactions contemplated under the Restructuring be deemed to be the
amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period or Tax year in
which the income, receipts or profits were earned ended on and included the
Closing Date. The portion of any credits relating to a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period shall be determined as though the relevant taxable period ended on and
included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries.   (c) Subject to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyers, the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries shall indemnify and defend the Sellers and their Affiliates
and hold them harmless against (i) any and all Taxes imposed on any of the
Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries, which Taxes are not subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 5.5(a), including, but not limited to,
any and all Losses for Taxes that may be incurred or suffered by the Sellers
or their Affiliates (A) resulting from any transaction of any of the Sold
Companies or the Subsidiaries occurring on the Closing Date (but not
including the Restructuring or any other transaction undertaken by the
Sellers on the Closing Date), (B) with respect to any taxable period that
begins after the Closing Date and that are imposed on any of the Sold
Companies or the Subsidiaries or with respect to the Separate Assets (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes described in the proviso
contained in Section 5.5(a)(i)) or (C) with respect to any portion of a
Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date (but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes described in the proviso contained in
Section 5.5(a)(i)) and (ii) any Losses arising out of or incident to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in (i).   (d)
Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 5.5 shall be
made within ten days following written notice by the indemnitee that payment
of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is due, provided that the
indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two days
before it is due to the appropriate Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.6 below,
payment of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be
considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the appropriate Taxing Authority or court.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than as
specifically set forth in Section 9.1(d)(i)), indemnification with respect to
Taxes shall be governed solely by this Section 5.5.   5.6 Procedures
Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims. (a) If a claim shall be made against any
of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates (including, without limitation, the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities) by any Taxing
Authority, which, if successful, would result in an indemnity payment to any
of the Buyers or one of their Affiliates (including, without limitation, the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities) pursuant to
Section 5.5(a) (a "Tax Claim"), such Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers
in writing of such Tax Claim stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim
and the amount   -52-   thereof, to the extent known by such Buyer;
provided, however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided
herein will relieve the Sellers of their obligations hereunder only to the
extent that such failure prejudices the Sellers hereunder.   (b) With
respect to any Tax Claim, the Sellers shall, at their own expense, control
all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection
of counsel and accountants) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in their
sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings, audits and conferences with any Taxing Authority with
respect thereto and may, in their sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed
and sue for a refund where Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax
Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that the Sellers shall
not take or advocate (unless otherwise required by Law) any position that
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Buyers
or their Affiliates (including the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries, the
Separate Assets) without first consulting with the Buyers regarding such
position or (ii) take any action with respect to such Tax Claim that would
legally bind the Buyers without the prior written consent of the Buyers; and
provided, further, that the Sellers shall afford the Buyers the opportunity
to participate, as may reasonably be requested by the Buyers, with the
Sellers in contesting any Tax Claim solely to the extent such Tax Claim would
give rise to an indemnity obligation under Section 5.5(a)(iii)
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyers shall have the right, at
their expense, to control any other Tax claim; provided, however, that the
Buyers shall not take or advocate (unless otherwise required by Law) any
position that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Sellers or any of their Affiliates without first consulting with the
Sellers regarding such position or (ii) take any action with respect to such
Tax claim that would legally bind the Sellers without the prior written
consent of the Sellers.   5.7 Refunds and Tax Benefits. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.7(c), (i) any Tax refunds that are received
by the Buyers, any of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Separate
Assets, and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Buyers, any of the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Separate Assets become entitled,
that relate to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be for the account of the Sellers, and the Buyers shall
pay over to the Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit
within 15 days after the receipt of such refund or entitlement to a credit
thereto, (ii) to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding results
in a payment or credit against Tax by a Taxing Authority to the Buyers, any
of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Separate Assets, of any amount
accrued for any taxable periods or portions thereof ending before the Closing
Date, the Buyers shall pay such amount to the Sellers within 15 days after
receipt or entitlement thereto and (iii) to the extent that any of the
Sellers prepay any Taxes relating to taxable periods or portions thereof
beginning after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall repay such amounts to the
Sellers within 15 days after the Tax Return relating to such Taxes is filed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Tax refunds that are received for Taxes
described in Section 5.4(c) shall be shared equally by the Buyers, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.   (b) The Buyers and their
Affiliates shall be entitled to any (i) refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Sold Companies and Subsidiaries or Taxes related to the Separate Assets
attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the
Closing Date and (ii) refunds or credits for Taxes for which the Sellers and
their Affiliates are indemnified pursuant to Section 5.5(c).   -53-   
(c) The Buyers agree that they shall not cause or permit any of the Sold
Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Venture Entities the Taxes of which they
are responsible for filing to carry back to any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date any net operating loss, loss from operations or other
Tax attribute that is attributable to a taxable period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Loss") except in the case
of a Post-Closing Loss that would be forfeited under Law unless it was first
carried back to a taxable period ending on or before or including the Closing
Date, in which case the Buyers may, at their sole expense, cause or permit
any of the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries or Venture Entities to carry back
such Post-Closing Loss. The Sellers shall have no obligation under this
Agreement to return or remit any such refund or other Tax benefit
attributable to a breach by any Buyer of the foregoing undertaking.   (d)
The applicable Buyer shall give the Sellers at least 30 days\' notice before
it files a claim for a Tax refund with respect to a Post-Closing Loss that it
is permitted to carry back to a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 5.7(c). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Sellers shall be entitled to use any
Post-Closing Loss that is carried back to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing date pursuant to Section 5.7(c) to reduce their Taxes for
such taxable period and their concomitant indemnity obligation to the Buyers
under Section 5.5(a) and (ii) the Sellers shall in no event be obligated to
reimburse or otherwise indemnify the Buyers for any Losses (including,
without limitation, Losses for Taxes) resulting from the disallowance of a
Post-Closing Loss.   (e) The Buyers and the Sellers agree to treat any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.7 as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price (unless a final determination causes any such payment to not be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price).   5.8 Employees; Benefit Plans.
(a) Employees. To the extent Transfer Regulations or other Laws do not
otherwise apply, the Buyers shall cause all active employees (as hereinafter
defined) of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Asset Sellers, to
the extent such employees are employed in the Business as of the Closing
Date, to remain employed with the Buyers, the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, following the Closing Date; provided, however,
that with respect to any employees of the Asset Sellers in jurisdictions
outside the United States that do not have Transfer Regulations who would
not, under Law, be automatically transferred to the Buyers, the Buyers shall,
within 15 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, provide such employees
with written offers of ongoing employment with the Buyers after the Closing
Date, conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, on terms of employment
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the terms of employment provided to
such employees by the Asset Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date;
and provided, further, that the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause all such employees who are offered ongoing
employment with the Buyers to accept such offers of ongoing employment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.8(a), as of the Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold
Companies or the Subsidiaries to, assume or retain and be responsible for the
employment (including any employment contracts) of all Company Employees who
are employed outside the United States (the "Non-U.S. Employees"), and
the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies to, take any and all
actions necessary or appropriate (if any) to continue the employment of such
Non-U.S. Employees, without the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Closing having any Liability to any   -54-   such
employees for severance, redundancy, termination, payment in lieu of notice,
indemnity or other payments to any of such employees by reason of, or as a
result of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, any employee who is not actively at work on the Closing Date
due to a short-term absence, whether paid or unpaid (e.g., vacation, holiday,
jury duty, FMLA, pregnancy, parental and bereavement leave, scheduled time
off, or illness or injury of a duration that is less than or equal to eight
days) in compliance with the applicable policies of Sellers, the
Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, (excluding any employee
who is not actively at work on the Closing Date and is receiving
worker\'s compensation payments as required by Law) shall be deemed an
"active employee". All active employees of the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries, as well as those employees of the Asset Sellers who accept the
Buyers\' offer of ongoing employment, are hereinafter referred to as the
"Company Employees". With respect to each employee employed in the Business
but not actively at work as of the Closing Date due to (i) a short-term
absence for illness or injury of a duration that is greater than eight days;
(ii) a long term absence covered under a long-term disability Company Benefit
Plan or (iii) an absence for which the employee is receiving worker\'s
compensation payments as required by Law, the Buyers shall reinstate or offer
to reinstate (or with respect to any such inactive employee of an Asset
Seller, shall offer) each such employee to his or her former position when
such employee gives notice of such employee\'s intention to return to work
following the Closing Date (provided that such employee is capable of
performing the essential functions of his or her former position to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Buyers), and at such time as such employee
begins his or her work, such employee will become or be deemed to become a
Company Employee for all purposes under this Agreement.   (b) Employment-
Related Liabilities. Effective as of the Closing Date, except as contemplated
by the Transition Services Agreement or as required by Law, collective
bargaining agreement or otherwise by this Section 5.8:   (i) All Company
Employees will cease active  participation in, and any benefit accrual under,
each of the Company  Benefit Plans (other than those plans sponsored and
maintained by the  Sold Companies and their Subsidiaries); provided, however,
that effective  as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall amend each U.S. Company
Benefit  Plan that is a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA)  to provide that each Company Employee\'s benefit that has accrued as
of  the Closing Date is fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the Closing 
Date;   (ii) Sellers shall retain or assume all Liabilities  in respect of
all employees (other than the Company Employees), including  all former
employees as of the Closing Date of the Sold Companies, the  Subsidiaries and
the Asset Sellers (the "Former Employees") under all  Company Benefit Plans
(including all Liabilities for post-employment and  post-retirement welfare
benefit obligations for Former Employees under  U.S. Company Benefit Plans);
provided, however, that, with respect to  Foreign Plans sponsored and
maintained solely by the Sold Companies or  the Subsidiaries, the Buyers
shall assume or cause such entities to  retain Liabilities with respect to
such plans, except that Sellers shall  retain any Liabilities in respect of
employment-related Proceedings that  are based on facts and circumstances
that arose or existed prior to the  Closing Date, to the extent that the
adjudicated or agreed upon remedy is  monetary in nature;   -55-   
(iii) With respect to Liabilities relating to Company  Employees employed by
the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries, the Buyers  shall be responsible for
all emoluments, outgoings and all other  Liabilities in respect of the
Company Employees (including any wages,  amounts due under any Company
Benefit Plans, Proceedings and Taxes) in  respect of the period after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that  Seller shall retain (A) all
Liabilities in respect of the Company  Employees who participate in the
Ingersoll-Rand Pension Plan Number One  and (B) any Liabilities in respect of
employment-related Proceedings that  are based on facts and circumstances
that arose or existed prior to the  Closing Date, to the extent that the
adjudicated or agreed upon remedy is  monetary in nature; and   (iv) With
respect to Liabilities relating to Company  Employees employed by the Asset
Sellers prior to the Closing Date, (A)  the Buyers shall be responsible for
all emoluments, outgoings and all  other Liabilities in respect of the
Company Employees (including any  wages, Proceedings and Taxes) in respect of
the period after the Closing  Date, and (B) the Sellers shall be responsible
for all emoluments,  outgoings and all other Liabilities in respect of the
Company Employees  (including any wages, amounts due under any Company
Benefit Plans,  Proceedings and Taxes) in respect of the period up to and
including the  Closing Date, to the extent such Liabilities are based on
facts and  circumstances that arose or existed prior to the Closing Date or
may be  retained by the Sellers pursuant to Law and, solely with respect to
such  Liabilities in respect of employment-related Proceedings, only to the 
extent that the adjudicated or agreed upon remedy is monetary in nature.  
(c) Continuation of Comparable Benefit Plans. For the period from the Closing
Date through December 31, 2003 (or such other longer period required by Law
or contract), the Buyers shall maintain, or shall cause the Sold Companies
and the Subsidiaries to maintain, employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements for Company Employees (other than Company Employees who are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement (such employees, the "Union
Employees")) that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the
Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing.   (d)
Collective Bargaining Agreement(s). The Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries to, assume or maintain the obligations
pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement(s) set forth in
Schedule 3.13 with respect to Union Employees and shall continue the
employment of all Union Employees covered by said agreements under the same
terms and conditions of employment as existed at the Closing. The Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or cause to be
furnished such information and assistance relating to the assumption by the
Buyers of the obligations under the collective bargaining agreements pursuant
to the preceding clause as the Buyers shall reasonably request. The Sellers
will, upon the request of the Buyers, arrange a meeting with union
representatives at those facilities where the Buyers are assuming the
collective bargaining agreements pursuant to this paragraph to discuss
transitional issues. Such meeting(s) will not involve the discussion of the
changing or modifying of any terms and/or conditions of employment specified
in the assumed collective bargaining agreements.   -56-    (e) Prior
Service; Deductibles. To the extent not otherwise required by or resulting
from the operation of Law, the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries to, recognize each Company Employee\'s service
with the Sellers, any of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or their respective predecessors as of the Closing as
service with the Buyers, the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in (but
not, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.8(d) or as required under
mandatory provisions of Laws relating to Non-U.S. Employees, for purposes of
eligibility for early retirement and benefit accrual) the Buyers\', the Sold
Companies\' and the Subsidiaries\' employee welfare benefit plans, employee
pension plans, vacation, disability, severance and other employee benefit
plans or policies and any other such plans or policies in which the Company
Employees will be entitled to participate in on and after the Closing Date.
In addition, the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under the employee welfare benefit plans applicable to
Company Employees or their respective spouses and dependents (but only to the
extent such pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting
periods were satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans as of the Closing
Date) and shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) the dollar amount of
all expenses incurred by Company Employees and their respective spouses and
dependents during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes
of satisfying the deductibles and co-payment or out-of-pocket limitations for
such calendar year under the relevant employee welfare benefit plans of the
Buyers, the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries, and any other such plans or
policies in which the Company Employees will be entitled to participate in on
and after the Closing Date, as applicable.   (f) Accrued Vacation. The
Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries to,
credit each Company Employee with the accrued and unused vacation days to
which the Company Employee is entitled through the Closing, which number of
days shall not exceed one year\'s vacation entitlement (or such shorter or
longer period as may be required under Law), with respect to each such
Company Employee as reflected on the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
(such vacation days to be used in the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs), and any personal and sickness days accrued by such employees as of
the Closing Date.   (g) Severance Obligations. (i) For the period from
the Closing Date until December 31, 2003, subject to Sections 5.8(g)(ii)
and 5.8(g)(iii), the Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries to, provide severance benefits to any Company Employee,
in accordance with the severance policy set forth in Schedule 5.8(g)(i) or as
may be required by, or resulting from, operation of Law for termination
of employment on or after the Closing, including terminations in connection
with this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated
hereby.   (ii) The Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies  and the
Subsidiaries to, assume all employment-related agreements  (including,
agreements providing for severance or termination payments or  benefits) to
which any Company Employee is a party, as set forth on  Schedule
5.8(g)(ii)(A); provided, however, that Sellers shall retain  liability, if
any, for severance payments made to any Company Employee  under the
transaction-related employment agreements set forth on Schedule 
5.8(g)(ii)(B) (the   -57-    "Severance Agreements") that arise in
connection with (A) an involuntary  termination without cause of the
employment of the Company Employee  subject to any such agreement by his or
her employer following the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to the  extent such severance payments exceed the amount
otherwise payable to  such Company Employee in accordance with the severance
policy set forth  on Schedule 5.8(g)(i) and (B) a voluntary termination of
employment by  any Company Employee subject to any such agreement for Good
Reason (as  defined in such agreement).   (iii) With respect to Company
Employees who are notified  prior to the Closing that their employment will
be terminated in  connection with the restructuring programs applicable to
the Sold  Companies and the Subsidiaries commenced prior to the Closing
(including  under any social plans or collective bargaining agreements),
Sellers will  retain liability for any severance payments (including any
termination  indemnities or other notice payments required by Law) made to
such  Company Employees.   (h) Bonus Payments. (i) As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall pay Company Employees any bonus earned
during 2003 under the Ingersoll-Rand Company 2003 Annual Incentive Matrix
Program prorated from January 1, 2003 through the Closing Date, based upon
actual results as of the Closing.   (ii) Sellers shall retain all liability
to pay all  bonuses payable to Company Employees pursuant to agreements,
plans or  programs adopted or established by the Sellers in connection with
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) Retiree Welfare
Benefits. Effective as of the Closing, the Buyers shall assume (or cause the
Sold Companies and Subsidiaries, if applicable, to continue to honor), to the
extent not otherwise required by or resulting from, operation of Law or
collective bargaining agreements, all post-employment and post-retirement
welfare benefit obligations with respect to all Company Employees and their
respective spouses and dependents. Subject to Law, in no event shall this
provision require the Buyers to assume the Company Benefit Plans providing
for the benefits described in this Section 5.8(i) nor prohibit the Buyers
from (i) providing any such post-employment and/or post-retirement welfare
benefits pursuant to a comparable Buyer Group Plan (or plans, as applicable)
or (ii) retaining the right to amend or terminate any such plan (subject to
Buyer\'s obligations under Section 5.8(a)).   (j) Flexible Benefits. To the
extent Company Employees contributed to a dependent care or medical expense
reimbursement account under a Company Benefit Plan or a plan of an Asset
Seller ("IR\'s Flexible Account Plan") during the calendar year that includes
the Closing, the Sellers shall transfer to the Buyers in cash an amount equal
to the amount credited to a dependent care or medical expense reimbursement
account, as applicable, maintained by the Buyers ("Buyers\' Flexible Account
Plan") that shall be equal as of the Closing Date to the account balances of
such Company Employees for such calendar year under IR\'s Flexible Account
Plan, and Buyer\'s Flexible Account Plan shall provide dependent care and
medical expense reimbursement account programs substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided under IR\'s Flexible Account Plan to such
Company Employees at least through the end of the plan year in effect as of
the Closing. The Buyers shall be responsible for all Liability for  
-58-   and administration of reimbursement claims that have not been
received by the Sellers as of the date the Sellers make the transfer provided
for herein to the Buyers in respect of IR\'s Flexible Account Plan,
regardless of when the claim was incurred.   (k) Cooperation. The parties
agree to furnish each other with such information concerning employees,
employee payroll and employee benefit plans, subject to confidentiality and
privacy considerations, and to take all such other action, as is necessary
and appropriate to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.   (l)
Non-U.S. Employment Matters.   (i) Employee Contracts/Transfer
Regulations/Employee  Consultations. The Sellers and the Buyers further
acknowledge and agree  that, to the extent applicable, pursuant and subject
to the Transfer  Regulations, the contracts of employment of the Non-U.S.
Employees in  jurisdictions with Transfer Regulations will have effect after
the  Closing as if originally made between the Buyers and the Non-U.S. 
Employees. The Sellers shall be responsible for complying with all 
obligations under Transfer Regulations to consult any Non-U.S. Employee  in
accordance with the Transfer Regulations on or prior to the Closing  Date.
Immediately following execution of this Agreement, the Sellers and  the
Buyers shall or shall procure that all information and consultation 
processes required to be conducted by them pursuant to the Transfer 
Regulations, any collective bargaining agreement, or any other Laws are 
complied with in respect of informing and consulting Non-U.S. Employees. 
Neither the Sellers nor the Buyers shall make any statements to any  Non-U.S.
Employees that are inconsistent with the provisions of this  Section
5.8(l)(i) without the prior consent of the other parties hereto.   (ii)
Foreign Plans. Without limiting the generality of  the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.8, effective as of the  Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall
cause the Sold Companies and the  Subsidiaries to, maintain, establish and/or
qualify or register with  applicable regulatory authorities employee benefit
plans for the Non-U.S.  Employees to the extent required by Law and from the
Closing through  December 31, 2003 (or longer if required by Law), provide
benefits to the  Non-U.S. Employees, considered as a group, on terms and
conditions which  are substantially comparable in the aggregate, to those
provided to  Non-U.S. Employees by the Sellers, the Sold Companies, the
Subsidiaries,  the Asset Sellers or their respective Affiliates immediately
prior to the  Closing.   (iii) Pension Plans for Non-U.S. Employees. In
connection  with Section 5.8(b)(ii) and (iii), effective as of the Closing,
the  Buyers shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries to, 
assume or retain sponsorship of, all right, title, interest, liability  and
obligation under (A) all Foreign Plans sponsored and maintained  solely by
the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries with respect to the  Non-U.S.
Employees and all Former Employees of the Sold Companies or the  Subsidiaries
who were employed outside the United States ("Former  Non-U.S. Employees"),
and (B) all pension assets in respect of such  Foreign Plans with respect to
Non-U.S. Employees and Former Non-U.S.  Employees; provided that the
assumption of such liabilities, obligations  and assets shall be in
accordance with, and subject to, all Laws.   -59-    In addition, the
Sellers shall cause all contributions or  payments required by Law or by any
applicable Foreign Plan to have been  paid or transferred to any Foreign Plan
for any period prior to the  Closing Date to be paid or transferred to such
Foreign Plan on or prior  to the Closing Date.   (iv) U.K. Pension Scheme.
(A) The Sellers shall, if  the Buyers so request, use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that any  U.K. asset Buyers, Nadella U.K. Limited and the
Torrington Company  Limited (the "U.K. Companies") (including any Affiliate
of Buyers that  succeeds to all or any part of their respective businesses)
are allowed  to participate, or (as the case may be) to continue
participation in the  Ingersoll-Rand Holdings Limited Retirement Benefits
Plan (1974) (the  "U.K. Pension Scheme") for and in respect of the Company
Employees who  are employed in the U.K. (the "U.K. Employees") for up to six
months  following the Closing Date (the "Transitional Period").   (B)
Sellers shall appoint a U.K. qualified  actuary ("Sellers\' U.K. Actuary")
and Buyers shall appoint a  U.K. qualified actuary ("Buyers\' U.K. Actuary")
to perform the  duties set forth below with respect to the U.K. Pension
Scheme.   (C) Sellers shall throughout the Transitional Period  use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that:   (1) no power, right (including
under rule  35.12), duty or discretion is exercised  under or in connection
with the U.K.  Pension Scheme (unless required by law) in  a way which would
or might affect the  Buyers and/or the U.K. Companies and/or  all or any of
their respective employees  without Buyers\' written consent; and   (2)
none of the U.K. Employees is discriminated  against in the exercise of any
discretionary  power (including the grant of discretionary  pension
increases or beneficial early  retirement terms) under the U.K. Pension 
Scheme.   (D) The Buyers shall cause the U.K. Companies to pay  to the U.K.
Pension Scheme the employer contributions which  accrue to the U.K. Pension
Scheme during the Transitional  Period in respect of its employees in
pensionable service from  time to time, such contributions to be deemed to be
payable at  the same rate as is in force as at the date of this Agreement 
but subject to a maximum amount of (i) 12% for U.K. Employees  at Torrington
Company Limited, and (ii) 15% for U.K. Employees  at Nadella U.K. Limited, of
pensionable remuneration. The  Buyers shall cause the U.K. Companies to
comply in all respects  with the provisions of the U.K. Pension Scheme during
the  Transitional Period. Buyers shall also cause the U.K. Companies  not to
do or omit to do any act or thing which would or might  adversely affect the
tax approval or contracting-out status of  the U.K. Pension Scheme throughout
the   -60-    Transitional Period. Notwithstanding anything set forth in
this  Section 5.8(l)(iv), during the Transitional Period, Buyers may  make
such changes at the U.K. Companies as it shall elect  (subject to Law and the
terms of the U.K. Pension Scheme);  provided, however, that in the event any
such changes  (including, without limitation, the increase of any
pensionable  emoluments of U.K. Employees) result in increased costs or 
other Liabilities under the U.K. Pension Scheme, Buyers shall  be responsible
for any such increased costs or other  Liabilities.   (E) Buyers and
Sellers shall cooperate with each  other to ensure that the employment of the
U.K. Employees is  contracted-out by reference to the U.K. Pension Scheme at
all  applicable times during the Transitional Period.   (F) On the U.K.
Companies ceasing to participate  (or on Closing, if there is no Transitional
Period) in the U.K.  Pension Scheme (such date being the "Membership
Transfer  Date"), Sellers shall request the U.K. Pension Scheme to write  to
the Buyers, their Affiliates or the U.K. Companies within 28  Business Days
confirming that no amount is due from them under  Section 75 U.K. Pensions
Act 1995 (such act, the "Section 75  Act", and any such liability, the
"Section 75 Liability"). In  the event that the U.K. Pension Scheme does not
confirm that no  Section 75 Liability is payable by the Buyers, their 
Affiliates, the U.K. Companies or the Buyers\' U.K. Plan  pursuant to the
Section 75 Act, the Sellers shall pay to the  U.K. Pension Scheme, within
such period as may be required by  the U.K. Pension Scheme, the amount of the
Section 75  Liability, in full satisfaction of the liability with respect 
thereto of the Buyers, their Affiliates, the U.K. Companies and  the Buyers\'
U.K. Plan and the obligation of the Sellers under  this sentence. In addition
to the foregoing, Sellers shall  indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyers,
their Affiliates,  the U.K. Companies and the Buyers\' U.K. Plan from any
Liability  or Loss arising from or attributable to the provision of 
relevant benefits (within the meaning of Section 612 U.K.  Income and
Corporation Taxes Act of 1988) to or in respect of  all or any of the U.K.
Employees under the U.K. Pension Scheme,  to the extent attributable to any
period of service between  Closing and the Membership Transfer Date. This
indemnity shall  not extend, however, to any unpaid employer contributions
under  Section 5.8(l)(iv)(D) or any Liability that was fully and  fairly
reflected in the calculation of any transfer value  received by the Buyers\'
U.K. Plan in respect of Consenting  Employees.   (G) Immediately after the
Membership Transfer Date,  Sellers shall cause Sellers\' U.K. Actuary to
calculate the  amount of the bulk transfer payment payable for or in
respect  of any U.K. Employee in pensionable service immediately before  the
Membership Transfer Date (each being a "Consenting  Employee") that accepts
within 48 Business Days of receiving a  transfer form from the U.K. Pension
Scheme an offer   -61-    to take a transfer value from the U.K. Pension
Scheme to a  nominated plan of the Buyers or the relevant employee the (the 
"Buyers\' U.K. Plan"). The bulk transfer payment (in the amount  determined
as described herein, the "Adjusted Transfer Value")  shall be calculated on a
projected benefit obligation basis  (within the meaning of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 87  ("FAS 87")) ("projected benefit obligation") and
shall be  calculated and adjusted in accordance with the actuarial method 
and assumptions specified by the Sellers\' U.K. Actuary in  Schedule
5.8(l)(iv)(G) (the "U.K. Assumptions"). Sellers shall  cause Sellers\' U.K.
Actuary to submit his calculation of the  Adjusted Transfer Value in writing
to Buyers\' U.K. Actuary  within 48 Business Days of the Membership Transfer
Date. If  Buyers\' U.K. Actuary agrees to the amount of the Adjusted 
Transfer Value, the Adjusted Transfer Value shall become  binding on all
parties. If, however, Buyers\' U.K. Actuary and  Sellers\' U.K. Actuary fail
to agree about any error claimed by  Buyers\' U.K. Actuary within 40 Business
Days from the date upon  which Sellers\' U.K. Actuary first submits its
findings to  Buyers\' U.K. Actuary, the matter may, at the option of either 
Buyers or Sellers be referred to an independent U.K. actuary  pursuant to
Section 5.8(l)(iv)(K).   (H) Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts  to cause the U.K. Pension Scheme to transfer to the Buyers\'  U.K.
Plan on a date agreed (the "Payment Date") between the  U.K. Pension Scheme
and the Buyers\' U.K. Plan (and in default  of agreement the date which is
six months after the Membership  Transfer Date) the Adjusted Transfer Value
in cash (or if the  U.K. Pension Scheme and the Buyers\' U.K. Plan so agree
transfer  a reasonable cross section of the assets of the U.K. Pension 
Scheme having a value at the Payment Date equal to the Adjusted  Transfer
Value). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event  that the U.K. Pension
Scheme refuses to transfer the full  amount of the Adjusted Transfer Value,
on the Payment Date,  Sellers shall transfer an amount, in cash, to the
Buyers\' U.K.  Plan equal to the excess of the Adjusted Transfer Value over 
the amount of assets the U.K. Pension Scheme has agreed to  transfer, such
that on the Payment Date, Buyers\' U.K. Plan  shall receive in total an
amount equal to the Adjusted Transfer  Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event the Sellers  are not permitted by Law or by the terms of the
U.K. Pension  Scheme to transfer such amount directly to the Buyers\' U.K. 
Plan, the Sellers shall pay such amount to the Buyers, who  shall promptly
deposit such amount in full to the Buyers\' U.K.  Plan.   (I) None of the
above provisions shall apply to  additional voluntary contributions or any
other benefits that  are calculated on a money purchase basis (within the
meaning of  Section 181 U.K. Pension Schemes Act 1993). Sellers shall, 
nonetheless, use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that  the U.K.
Pension Scheme transfers to the U.K. Buyers\' Plan on  the Payment Date the
funds and assets of the U.K. Pension  Scheme that represent any such
contributions or money purchase   -62-    benefits of Consenting
Employees.   (J) On receipt of the Adjusted Transfer Value in full  on the
Payment Date, Buyers shall cause the Buyers\' U.K. Plan  to credit benefits
under its plan in respect of service before  the Membership Transfer Date
that are, in the reasonable  opinion of Buyers\' U.K. Actuary and as
confirmed by the  Seller\'s U.K. Actuary, substantially no less favorable
overall  than the benefits that would have been payable under the U.K. 
Pension Scheme in respect of such service had the U.K.  Companies continued
to participate in the U.K. Pension Scheme  on an indefinite basis.   (K)
Any dispute between the Sellers\' U.K. Actuary  and the Buyers\' U.K. Actuary
concerning the calculation of the  bulk transfer payment or any other matter
to be agreed between  them in accordance with this Section may, at the option
of  either Sellers or Buyers, be referred to an independent actuary  to be
appointed by agreement between the Sellers and the Buyers  or, in default of
agreement within 10 Business Days from the  first nomination of an actuary by
one party to the other, by  the President for the time being of The U.K.
Institute of  Actuaries (or of any successor body) on the application of 
either Sellers or the Buyers. The independent actuary shall act  as an expert
and not as an arbitrator. His decision shall,  except in the case of fraud or
manifest error, be final and  binding on the parties and his costs shall be
borne by Sellers  and Buyers equally or in such other proportion as he
shall  direct.   (v) German Pension Plans. The Buyers shall assume the 
pension plans (and all rights and obligations thereunder) maintained by 
Torrington Nadellager GmbH and Torrington GmbH as of the Closing Date.  
(vi) French Pension Plans. The Buyers shall assume the  pension plans (and
all rights and obligations thereunder) maintained by  Nadella, Nadella
Industries (France) S.A. and Torrington France as of the  Closing Date.  
(vii) Canadian Pension Plan. (A) In accordance with  Section 5.8(l)(iii), the
Buyers shall assume the pension plan sponsored  and maintained by Ingersoll-
Rand Canada, Inc. for all of its current and  former employees represented by
Canadian Auto Workers Local 956, and all  Liabilities, rights and obligations
thereunder and assets thereof (the  "Canadian Pension Plan"). In connection
with the Sellers\' assignment and  Buyers\' assumption of the Canadian
Pension Plan, the Sellers and the  Buyers each agree to prepare and file all
necessary resolutions as  amendments to the plan with the appropriate
Government Authorities, and  shall provide such notice as may be required to
the participants of such  plan in respect of such assignment and
assumption.   (B) In the event that the projected benefit  obligation (as
calculated and adjusted by the Sellers\' designated  actuarial firm (the
"Sellers\' Actuary") in accordance with the  actuarial methods and
assumptions as in effect for the valuation  period ending December 31,  
-63-    2002) under the Canadian Pension Plan exceeds the fair market value
of  the assets of the Canadian Pension Plan (in each case as of the  Closing
Date), the Sellers shall transfer an amount, in cash, equal to  any such
excess directly to the Canadian Pension Plan. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
in the event the Sellers are not permitted by Law or by  the Canadian Pension
Plan to transfer such excess amount directly to  the Canadian Pension Plan,
the Sellers shall pay such excess to the  Buyers, who shall promptly transfer
such excess in full to the  Canadian Pension Plan.   (viii) Australian
Pension Plan. The parties agree that,  to the extent permitted by Law and the
Sellers\' Australian Plan (as defined  below), following the Closing there
shall be a transfer of assets and  liabilities attributable to Company
Employees employed in Australia from  the Ingersoll Rand (Australia)
Retirement Fund (the "Sellers\' Australian  Plan") to a plan or plans of
Buyers or an Affiliate of Buyers capable of  receiving such transfer (the
"Buyers\' Australian Plan"). The parties shall  agree on appropriate and
customary terms with respect to such transfer,  subject to the requirement
that (i) the amount of assets to be so  transferred shall be calculated on a
projected benefit obligation basis as  of the Closing Date, using the same
assumptions and methods as were used in  the calculation of the projected
benefit obligation for the Sellers\'  Australian Plan for the valuation
period ending December 31, 2002 (the  "Australian Plan PBO"), and (ii) to the
extent that the Sellers\' Australian  Plan cannot transfer the full amount of
the Australian Plan PBO to the  Buyers\' Australian Plan, Sellers shall
transfer an amount in cash, to the  Buyers\' Australian Plan (or in the event
the Sellers are not permitted by  Law or by the Sellers\' Australian Plan, to
the Buyers, which shall deposit  such amount promptly in the Buyers\'
Australian Plan), equal to the excess  of the Australian Plan PBO over the
amount of assets the Sellers\'  Australian Plan agrees to transfer, such that
Buyers\' Australian Plan shall  receive in total an amount equal to the
Australian Plan PBO.   (m) Funding Adjustment of Pension Plans. With respect
to any Foreign Plans that would be required to be accounted for under FAS 87
if such plan was maintained in the U.S. (without regard to any
materiality requirement under FAS 87 (the "Foreign DB Plans") and which is
not required to be funded under the Law in that jurisdiction, the Sellers
shall cause the Sellers\' Actuary to calculate, as soon as practicable after
the Closing, the projected benefit obligation ("PBO") under each such plan as
of the Closing Date, (the "Closing PBO"), using the same assumptions and
methods as were used in calculation of the PBO for such plan for the
valuation period ending December 31, 2001 (the "2001 PBO"). The Sellers\'
Actuary shall then compare the Closing PBO to the 2001 PBO with respect to
each such plan. Where the 2001 PBO exceeds the Closing PBO for any such
plans, such amounts shall be applied to reduce any amounts where the Closing
PBO exceeds the 2001 PBO for any such plans, so that on an aggregate basis
for all such plans there shall remain either a positive or negative PBO
number. If the aggregate amount of the Closing PBO (after the application of
the foregoing sentence) exceeds the 2001 PBO, Sellers shall pay the Buyers
such amount. All calculations required hereunder shall be done by
the Sellers\' Actuary, using consistent actuarial assumptions and methods to
those used in the calculation of the 2001 PBO. Sellers shall cause Sellers\'
Actuary to submit his calculation of the 2001 PBO and Closing PBO to such
actuary as Buyers shall identify as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. If the Buyers\' actuary (as designated by the   -64-   Buyers)
disagrees with the amount of the assets to be transferred, the Buyers and
Sellers shall follow a dispute mechanism that is substantially identical
to that set forth in Section 5.8(l)(iv).   (n) No Right to Employment.
Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of
the Sellers, the Buyers, the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates, any additional rights or remedies, including any additional right
to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   5.9 Labor
Matters. (a) The Buyers agree that from and after the Closing the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any notification
required under the WARN Act with respect to the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries. Each Stock Seller agrees that between the date hereof and
the Closing Date, it will cause the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries not
to effect or permit a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as these terms are
defined in the WARN Act with respect to any member of the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries without notifying the Buyers in advance and without
complying with the notice requirements and all other provisions of the WARN
Act. The Sellers will also notify the Buyers, prior to the Closing, of all
layoffs and terminations at any "single site of employment" or "facility or
operating unit within a single site of employment" that occur within 90 days
of the Closing and that, in the aggregate, exceed 20% of the workforce at
either the "single site of employment" or a "facility or operating unit". The
Buyers will take no action or make any statement prior to Closing which will
obligate the Sellers to provide a group of employees with WARN
notification.   (b) The Sellers and the Buyers shall reasonably
cooperate in connection with any required notification to, or any required
consultation with, or the provision of documents and information to, the
employees, employee representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and
relevant government agencies and governmental officials concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Foreign
Employees of any of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries so that such
Persons may render advice as required in accordance with Law.   5.10
Financing. (a) Timken shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete a
Qualifying Equity Offering as soon as practicable after, and in any event
within 45 days after, the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth
in Sections 6.4 and 7.4 and receipt by Timken of a notice declaring the
effectiveness of the registration statement to be used in connection with
such Qualifying Equity Offering. Timken shall (i) file such registration
statement within 10 days of the date hereof and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective as soon
as practicable after filing. If, notwithstanding its reasonable best efforts,
Timken cannot complete a Qualifying Equity Offering by the date specified in
the first sentence of this Section 5.10, then the Closing shall be postponed
for the period, not to exceed 45 calendar days, necessary in order to
complete a Qualifying Equity Offering. If, notwithstanding its reasonable
best efforts, Timken is unable to complete a Qualifying Equity Offering on or
prior to the 45th calendar day of such extended period, this Agreement may be
terminated by the Sellers or the Buyers pursuant to Section 8.1(d).  
-65-    (b) Timken shall use its reasonable best efforts to close the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and obtain funds
thereunder necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on or prior to the third Business Day following the date of
completion of the Qualifying Equity Offering. If for any reason Timken cannot
obtain such Financing by such date on the terms set forth in the Commitment
Letter, Timken shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such Financing
by such date from other sources. In no event shall Timken be required to
accept overall terms and conditions for any such replacement Financing that
are substantially less favorable to the Buyers than those set forth in the
Commitment Letter; provided that the interest rate terms of any such
replacement Financing shall be deemed not to be substantially less favorable
if such replacement Financing provides for an Investment Grade LIBOR Margin
of not greater than 2%. If the Investment Grade LIBOR Margin for any such
replacement Financing is greater than 2%, provided that IR elects to
reimburse the Buyers for any Excess Interest actually incurred by the Buyers
pursuant to the replacement Financing, the interest rate terms of such
replacement Financing shall be deemed not to be substantially less favorable
to the Buyers than those set forth in the Commitment Letter. Furthermore, any
replacement Financing that imposes any terms that the lenders are permitted
to impose pursuant to the Fee Letter shall be deemed not to be substantially
less favorable to the Buyers than those set forth in the Commitment Letter.
IR, as a condition to its election permitted above, may require that the
lenders of such replacement Financing shorten the maturity dates of the
replacement Financing to the extent permitted in the Fee Letter in order to
minimize or eliminate any Excess Interest that might otherwise be imposed as
part of such replacement Financing. For purposes hereof, "Investment Grade
LIBOR Margin" means any margin over LIBOR for LIBOR-based loans that
is applicable under the Financing at any time that Timken\'s senior unsecured
credit rating from Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard and Poor\'s Rating
Group is at least investment grade (it being understood that such Financing
may include "performance pricing" that provides that applicable margins may
be higher or lower based on Timken\'s particular debt ratings in effect at
any time); and "Excess Interest" means the excess of (i) the interest rate
actually charged in respect of loans incurred under a replacement Financing
entered into pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount not to exceed $600 million at any time over (ii) the
interest rate that would have been charged for such loans under the Financing
described in the Commitment Letter assuming that (A) LIBOR, Alternate Base
Rates and any other underlying reference rates are the same for purposes of
the Financing described in the Commitment Letter and the replacement
Financing and (B) the Applicable Margin in effect pursuant to the Financing
described in the Commitment Letter was adjusted upwards by the maximum amount
permitted in the Fee Letter referred to in the Commitment Letter. Timken
shall use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy at or before the date
specified above all requirements that are conditions to its consummation of
such Financing and to the drawing down of the cash proceeds thereunder.
Without IR\'s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), Timken will not (i) amend or otherwise modify either of the
Commitment Letter or the second paragraph of Section 3(c) of the Fee
Letter in any manner adverse to the Buyers or the Sellers, (ii) waive any
material rights under the Commitment Letter or the second paragraph of
Section 3(c) of the Fee Letter, (iii) except as set forth above, enter into
any alternative financing commitment, or (iv) agree to any term or provision
in any agreement or arrangement related to the Financing that imposes any
restriction or limitation on IR or its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, any provision that limits any sales or other transactions by IR
and its Affiliates with respect to the Timken Common Stock).   -66-   
(c) IR shall make all payments of Excess Interest on the date on which Timken
is obligated to make payment of the related interest payments to the lenders
pursuant to the credit facilities obtained under the replacement Financing as
to which such payment obligations apply. The amount payable by IR in respect
of Excess Interest on each such date shall be calculated as the amount equal
to:   (i) in the case of borrowings under the term loan  facility, the sum
of the amounts, calculated on a daily basis for each day  during such period
in respect of which payment is being made by Timken,  equal to:   (A) the
amount of interest payable by Timken in  respect of such day; times   (B) a
fraction (1) the numerator of which is (x)  the rate set forth in clause (i)
of the definition of  "Excess Interest" for such day minus (y) the rate set
forth  in clause (ii) of the definition of Excess Interest and (2)  the
denominator of which is the actual interest rate  applicable on such day;
plus   (ii) in the case borrowings under the revolving credit  facility,
the sum of the amounts, calculated on a daily basis for each day  during such
period in respect of which payment is being made by Timken,  equal to:  
(A) the amount of interest payable by Timken in  respect of such day;
provided that, if the outstanding loan  balance plus the term loan balance
for such day exceeds $600  million, an amount equal to such amount of
interest times a  fraction (1) the numerator of which is $600 million minus 
the term loan balance as of such date and (2) the  denominator of which is
the amount of loans actually  outstanding under the revolving credit
facilities as of such  date; times   (B) a fraction (1) the numerator of
which is (x)  the rate set forth in clause (i) of the definition of  "Excess
Interest" for such day minus (y) the rate set forth  in clause (ii) of the
definition of Excess Interest and (2)  the denominator of which is the actual
interest rate  applicable on such day.   5.11 Contact with Customers and
Suppliers. Prior to the Closing, Timken and its representatives shall contact
and communicate with the Company Employees, customers, suppliers and
licensors of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of the
Sellers, which consent may be conditioned upon a designee of the Sellers
being present at any such meeting or conference; provided, however, that
Timken shall not be required to obtain such consent or to have such Sellers\'
attendance for meetings with those customers and suppliers of the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries that are also customers and suppliers of
Timken.   5.12 Non-Competition. Each of the Sellers agrees that from the
Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing, it will not directly
or indirectly engage or invest in any business in competition with the
Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing. It is  
-67-   understood and agreed that (i) no Seller shall be deemed to be in
default with respect to the foregoing covenant as a result of any investment
it may make in Timken Common Stock or in not more than 5% of the outstanding
capital stock or other ownership interests of any other Person whose equity
securities are publicly traded, (ii) the provisions of this Section 5.12
shall not apply to any business activities of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, other than the business of the Engineered Solutions business
segment, (iii) this Section 5.12 shall not be construed to prohibit any of
the Sellers, directly or through any Affiliate, from hereafter acquiring and
continuing to own and operate (A) any entity which has operations that
compete with the Business if such operations account for no more than 15% of
such entity\'s consolidated revenues at the time of such acquisition, or (B)
any entity which has operations that compete with the Business and account
for more than 15% of such entity\'s consolidated revenues, provided that in
the case of this clause (B), the Sellers shall divest, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within 18 months after the closing of such
acquisition even if such 18-month period ends after the third anniversary of
the Closing) such portion of such entity\'s operations that compete with the
Business that will cause such acquisition to thereafter comply with clause
(A); and (iv) the provisions of this Section 5.12 shall not be construed to
prohibit any of the Sellers, directly or through Affiliates, from selling
inventory or other assets currently owned by such Sellers or Affiliates.  
(b) In the event that the covenants contained in Section 5.12(a) are more
restrictive than permitted by Law, the parties hereto agree that the
covenants contained in Section 5.12(a) shall be enforceable and enforced to
the extent permitted by Law.   (c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of the requirements of this
Section 5.12 would be inadequate, and agrees and consents that without
intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available, temporary
and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may be granted without
proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy in any Proceeding which
may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 5.12.  
5.13 Intercompany Debt. On or prior to the day before the Closing, (i) each
of the Sold Companies that has positive "Net Intercompany Receivables" shall
distribute such Net Intercompany Receivables to its shareholders and (ii) the
Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cancel any Net
Intercompany Receivables of each of the Sold Companies that has negative Net
Intercompany Receivables and such cancellation shall be treated as a
contribution of capital to such Sold Company with the result that there
shall be no intercompany receivables or intercompany payables between the
Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers or
their Affiliates, on the other hand, at the Closing Date. As used herein,
"Net Intercompany Receivables" shall mean with respect to each Sold Company
(i) all intercompany receivables due to such Sold Company and its
Subsidiaries from the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries), less (ii) all intercompany payables of such
Sold Company and its Subsidiaries to the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries).   5.14 No Hire. IR agrees
that until the first anniversary of the Closing, it will not, and will cause
its subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the Timken,
hire (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of the Business) any
employees of the Business;   -68-   provided, however, that the foregoing
provision will not prevent IR and its Affiliates from hiring (i) any
secretarial, clerical or other non-managerial employee (other than
professionals or sales employees), (ii) any Company Employee whose employment
has been terminated by Timken or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) the
individuals listed on Schedule 5.14.   5.15 Corporate Names. (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than
180 days from the Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries to remove or cover the name "IR" and any trademarks, trade
names, brandmarks, brand names, trade dress or logos relating or confusingly
similar to such name from all signs, billboards, advertising materials,
telephone listings, labels, stationery, office forms, packaging or other
materials of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries. Thereafter, the Buyers
shall neither use nor permit any of the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries to
use such names or any trademark, trade name, brandmark, brand name, trade
dress or logo relating or confusingly similar to such names in connection
with the businesses of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries or otherwise.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in any event no
later than 120 days thereafter, the Buyers shall cause each of the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries to amend its certificate of incorporation,
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement and other
applicable documents, subject to any required consent or approval of
any other partner or member, which the Buyers shall use their reasonable
efforts to obtain, so as to delete any reference to "IR" in its legal name
and, within such 120-day period, to make all required filings with
Governmental Authorities to effect such amendments.   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than
180 days from the Closing Date, the Sellers shall remove or cover the name
"Torrington," "Fafnir," "Kilian" or "Nadella" and any trademarks, trade
names, brandmarks, brand names, trade dress or logos relating or confusingly
similar to such name from all signs, billboards, advertising materials,
telephone listings, labels, stationery, office forms, packaging or other
materials. Thereafter, the Sellers shall neither use nor permit any of their
subsidiaries to use such names or any trademark, trade name, brandmark, brand
name, trade dress or logo relating or confusingly similar to such names. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in any event no
later than 120 days thereafter, the Sellers shall amend their certificates
of incorporation, partnership agreements, limited liability company
agreements and other applicable documents, subject to any required consent or
approval of any other partner or member, which the Sellers shall use their
reasonable efforts to obtain, so as to delete any reference to "Torrington,"
"Fafnir," "Kilian" or "Nadella" in its legal name and, within such 120-day
period, to make all required filings with Governmental Authorities to effect
such amendments. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
but in any event no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates will cease to do business under, or allow any of
their respective Affiliates to do business under, or license any third party
to use or do business under, the "Torrington," "Fafnir," "Kilian" or
"Nadella" name or mark (or any other name or mark confusingly similar to such
names and marks), or the name and mark "The Torrington Company."   (c) Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at Law for any
breach of the requirements of this Section 5.15 would be inadequate, and
agrees and consents that without intending to limit any additional remedies
that may be available, temporary   -69-   and permanent injunctive and
other equitable relief may be granted without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy in any Proceeding which may be brought to enforce
any of the provisions of this Section 5.15.   5.16 Restructuring. Prior to
the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Restructuring to be consummated to
the extent not completed prior to the date of this Agreement.   5.17
Continued Dumping Offset. (a) From and after the Closing Date, Torrington
shall use its reasonable best efforts to prosecute and/or defend, as
required, the payment of amounts due to the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries
as "affected domestic producers" (as such term is defined the United States-
Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, the "USDOA", and such
amounts due to "affected domestic producers" under the USDOA, the "Continued
Dumping Offset"). Torrington shall prepare any documentation required under
the USDOA in connection with the receipt of the Continued Dumping
Offset consistent with prior document submissions under the USDOA made by the
Sellers and subject to compliance by Torrington with Laws. Torrington shall
provide the Sellers (or their respective representatives) with copies of any
such documentation prepared by Torrington in a sufficiently timely manner to
allow the Sellers (or their respective representatives) to review and comment
upon such documentation prior to its submission by Torrington and shall
incorporate any reasonable comments of the Sellers. Torrington (or its
successor) shall make payments in cash to IRNJ, in amounts equal to (i) 100%
of all amounts received by Torrington in respect of the Continued Dumping
Offset applicable to the Business in 2002, (ii) 80% of all amounts received
by Torrington in respect of the Continued Dumping Offset applicable to the
Business in 2003 and (iii) 80% of all amounts received by Torrington in
respect of the Continued Dumping Offset applicable to the Business in 2004
(the "CDO Payment Rights"). No deduction shall be made in respect of any
costs incurred by Torrington (or its Affiliates) in connection with
Torrington\'s prosecution or defense of such payments, all of which costs
shall be borne by Torrington (or its Affiliates). All amounts payable to IRNJ
pursuant to this Section 5.17 shall be paid in cash within five days of
receipt of the Continued Dumping Offset by Torrington, provided that IRNJ
shall have furnished its account information not less than two Business Days
prior to any such payment by Torrington.   (b) Timken and IRNJ agree that
all amounts remitted by Torrington to IRNJ in respect of the Continued
Dumping Offset are not additional compensation for the Shares, the Venture
Interests and the Separate Assets, the fair market value of which is fully
reflected in the Purchase Price. Instead, consistent with IRNJ\'s interest as
principal to the Continued Dumping Offset payments under this Section 5.17,
Torrington shall apply for, collect, and remit all such amounts solely as
custodian and collection agent for and on behalf of IRNJ and not as a
principal, partner or joint venturer. Torrington may commingle such amounts
collected by it with its own funds, pending remittance to IRNJ, to the extent
necessary to avoid undue administrative expense, but shall not otherwise
exercise any dominion or control over such amounts, hold itself out to any
third party as their owner, or hold the amounts under claim of
right. Consistent with Torrington\'s status as IRNJ\'s custodian and
collection agent, IRNJ and Torrington shall report all such amounts collected
by Torrington and remitted to IRNJ for tax and financial reporting purposes
as having been received directly by IRNJ from the United States (unless
otherwise required under Law).   -70-    5.18 Rule 144 Matters.
Following the Closing, Timken shall timely file with the SEC all reports and
other filings required under the Exchange Act for the Sellers or their
Affiliates to sell shares of Timken Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act. Further, Timken shall offer all
reasonable and necessary assistance including, without limitation, the
delivery of a legal opinion letter and instructions to Timken\'s stock
transfer agent to facilitate the sale by IR or its Affiliates of shares
of Timken Common Stock pursuant to said Rule 144.   5.19 Listing of Shares
of Timken Common Stock. Timken shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Timken Common Stock to be issued as Share Consideration to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date.   5.20 Obligations of the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries. The Buyers agree to take any and all actions necessary to cause
IR and its Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries) to
be absolutely and unconditionally relieved on or prior to the Closing Date of
all liabilities and obligations arising out of the letters of credit,
performance bonds and other similar items issued and outstanding in
connection with the Business in the ordinary course of business (other than
letters of credit, performance bonds and other similar items related to
Environmental Liabilities of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and in
respect of the Separate Assets), and the Buyers shall indemnify IR and its
Affiliates against any Losses of any kind whatsoever with respect to such
liabilities and obligations. The Buyers agree to continue to use their
respective reasonable best efforts after the Closing Date to relieve IR and
its Affiliates of all such liabilities and obligations.   5.21 Cooperation;
Financial Information. IR agrees to cooperate with Timken in all reasonable
respects, and to cause the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Asset
Sellers with respect to the Business to cooperate in all reasonable respects,
in connection with Timken\'s efforts to obtain the Financing and to
consummate the Qualifying Equity Offering, including by providing access to
all information reasonably necessary in connection therewith upon reasonable
advance notice by Timken. IR agrees to provide and make available, and to
cause the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Asset Sellers make
available, upon reasonable advance notice, the senior management employees of
the Business, (i) for their participation in any "road shows" for the
Financing and the Qualifying Equity Offering and (ii) to respond to questions
and inquiries of financing sources and investors in regard to the Financing
and the Qualifying Equity Offering.   (b) IR shall deliver to Timken to the
extent required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") to be included or incorporated in the
registration statement for the Qualifying Equity Offering (i) not later than
November 15, 2002, the unaudited combined balance sheets of the Business as
of September 30, 2002 and 2001 and the related unaudited combined statements
of income and cash flows for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002
and 2001, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP, for inclusion in
Timken\'s registration statement in connection with the Qualifying Equity
Offering, (ii) the other interim financial statements of the Business
referred to in the Commitment Letter and (iii) such additional financial
statements of the Business as may be required to be included or incorporated
in such registration statement not later than the date such  
-71-   financial statements are so required. IR shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its independent public accountants to review such unaudited
financial statements referred to in clause (i) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71. Timken will
be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.21(b) to include the Audited
Financial Statements, the interim financial statements referenced to in
Section 3.5(a), and any interim financial statements required to be delivered
as described above in any registration statement or periodic report filed by
Timken or any of its Affiliates with the Commission in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or required by the
Qualifying Equity Offering, to the extent such inclusion is required pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Commission. Timken shall give the Sellers
reasonable opportunity to comment on any such registration statement.  
5.22 Transaction Agreements. The parties shall cooperate to prepare as soon
as reasonably practicable any and all Transaction Agreements not prepared as
of the date of this Agreement. In addition, the parties hereby agree that
each agreement, arrangement or other instrument as shall be required
under Law in order to transfer the Separate Assets, the Assumed Liabilities,
the Shares and the Venture Interests in Industria Cuscinetti S.p.A. shall
include only those representations, warranties and indemnities provided for
in this Agreement and such other provisions as are required by Law to give
effect to such transfer. Furthermore, IR shall cause the relevant Stock
Sellers to accept the French Offer Letter and to complete the sale of the
Nadella Shares and the Torrington France Shares subject to: (i) the
completion by the applicable Sellers and the applicable Buyers (with the
cooperation of the other party) of all requisite employee consultation
procedures; and (ii) all other conditions to the Closing set forth in ARTICLE
VI and ARTICLE VII having been satisfied or waived. It is the intention of
the parties, notwithstanding the provisions of any such agreement,
arrangement or other instrument, that no purchase and sale contemplated by
any such agreement, arrangement or instrument shall be consummated earlier
than simultaneous with the Closing. Accordingly, each of the parties will
take such action as may be necessary to ensure that no Closing under any such
agreement, arrangement or instrument occurs prior to the Closing.   5.23
Further Actions. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other
hand, will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable
best efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Law to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties
will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Subject to the terms
hereof, the Buyers and the Sellers agree to cooperate and to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, any Governmental Approvals required for the Closing under the
HSR Act, EC Merger Regulation and any other applicable Competition/Investment
Law, to respond to any government requests for information thereunder, to
contest and resist in good faith any action thereunder, and to have lifted or
overturned any Governmental Order that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an
"Antitrust Order"). The Buyers agree to propose, negotiate and cooperate with
the Sellers to effect prior to the Closing    -72-   Date, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of any of the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries or any of the Separate Assets (or otherwise take any action that
limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any
of the businesses, product lines, or assets of any of the Sold Companies or
the Subsidiaries or of the Separate Assets) as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any Proceeding,
which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyers to sell, divest or dispose
of (or otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain) (i) businesses that, in the aggregate
accounted for in excess of $25,000,000 in net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2001, or (ii) capitalized fixed assets with an original cost
basis exceeding $20,000,000. If assets of the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries or Separate Assets are sold, divested or disposed of, to the
extent the Adjusted Net Proceeds are negative, such Adjusted Net Proceeds
shall be paid by the Sellers to the Buyers and shall be treated as a
reduction of the Purchase Price. For purposes hereof, "Adjusted Net Proceeds"
shall mean (i) 100% of the net proceeds received by the Buyers from any sale,
divestiture or disposal of any assets of any Sold Companies, Subsidiaries or
Separate Assets pursuant to this Section 5.23(b) (which net proceeds shall be
deemed to be the gross proceeds of such sale, divestiture or disposal less
any incremental costs incurred by the Buyers (and not reimbursed by the
purchaser in such sale, divestiture or disposal) to move, install or modify
equipment, or any unreimbursed infrastructure or similar implementation costs
in order to effect any action required pursuant to this Section) less (ii) an
amount equal to the aggregate replacement cost (determined by GE Capital or
another firm selected by mutual agreement of IR and Timken) of any fixed
assets of the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries or Separate Assets sold, divested
or disposed of pursuant to this Section 5.23(b) (such replacement cost to be
equal to (i) the installed cost to acquire comparable used assets of
comparable age and operating condition, if available, or (ii) if such
comparably-aged and operated assets are not available, the installed cost of
comparable assets of such newer age as are available); provided that, without
the prior written consent of IR, the Sellers shall not be responsible for
paying the replacement cost of assets sold, divested or disposed of pursuant
to this Section 5.23(b) to the extent the aggregate original cost basis of
such assets exceeds $20,000,000 (and, absent such consent, any such assets in
excess of such amount shall not be included in the calculation of Adjusted
Net Proceeds).   (c) The Sellers agree to cooperate with the Buyers
in connection with effecting any required sale, divestiture or disposition
of assets or businesses of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries under
Section 5.23(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Sellers shall, at the request of the Buyers, agree to hold separate, sell,
divest or dispose of such assets or businesses of the Sold Companies and
Subsidiaries as may be required under Section 5.23(b).   (d) In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party will consult with counsel
for the other parties as to, and shall have the right to have a
representative present at, any Proceeding relating to any Antitrust Order.
Each party will (x) promptly notify the other parties of any written
communication to that party from any Governmental Authority and, subject to
Law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any such Governmental Authority and consider and
incorporate the other parties\' reasonable comments, and (y) furnish the
other parties with copies of all correspondence,   -73-   filings and
written communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives, on one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that if either IR or
Timken believes that any such communication to or from a Governmental
Authority contains (or in the case of a meeting is likely to involve
discussion of) commercially sensitive information that it is unwilling to
provide to the other, it shall be sufficient for IR or Timken, as the case
may be, to provide a copy of such communication (or an opportunity to attend
such meeting) to the other\'s outside counsel. The Sellers, on the one hand,
and the Buyers, on the other hand, will bear the costs and expenses of their
respective filings.   (e) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, prior to, as
of, and following the Closing Date, the Sellers, at the Sellers\' sole
expense, shall be solely responsible, subject to the Buyers\' reasonable
cooperation, for (i) preparing and timely submitting any and all filings and
any other submissions, (ii) serving as the certifying party regarding any and
all such filings and submissions, and (iii) taking any and all other actions,
including any investigation or remediation, in each case required under or
relating to the Connecticut Transfer Act, Connecticut General Statutes
Sections 22a-134 et seq. (the "Connecticut Transfer Act"), to the extent
relating to the Business, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereunder.   (f) At all times prior to the Closing, (i) the Sellers
will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly notify the
Buyers in writing of any fact, condition, event or occurrence that will
result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in ARTICLE VII to be
satisfied, promptly upon any of them becoming aware of the same and (ii) the
Buyers will, and will cause its Affiliates to, promptly notify the Sellers in
writing of any fact, condition, event or occurrence that will result in the
failure of any of the conditions contained in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied,
promptly upon any of them becoming aware of the same.   5.24 Further
Assurances. (a) Following the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyers will, and
will cause each of their respective Affiliates to, from time to time, execute
and deliver such additional instruments, documents, conveyances or assurances
and take such other actions as shall be necessary, or otherwise reasonably
requested by the Sellers or the Buyers, as applicable, to confirm and assure
the rights and obligations provided for in this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements and render effective the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to sell, convey, assign, sublease or transfer any asset if any attempted
sale, conveyance, assignment, sublease or transfer of such asset, without the
Consent of another Person to such transfer, would constitute a breach by the
Sellers or the Buyers with respect to such asset. Except with respect to the
Consents required to be delivered at the Closing pursuant to Section
2.5(a)(v), in the event that any required Consent is not obtained on or prior
to the Closing, the applicable Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) provide to the applicable Buyer the benefits of the applicable
contract or agreement, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the applicable Buyer and
(iii) enforce at the request of the applicable Buyer and for the account of
the applicable Buyer any rights of the Seller arising from any such contract
or agreement (including the right to elect   -74-   to terminate such
contract or agreement in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request
of the applicable Buyer).   5.25 Certain Indebtedness. At or prior to the
Closing, IR shall cause all Debt Obligations of the Sold Companies or any of
the Subsidiaries (other than the Debt Obligations listed on Schedule 5.25) to
be repaid in full or otherwise satisfied or eliminated without any
continuing liability or obligation of the Sold Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries.   5.26 Bearings Supply Arrangement. IR and its
subsidiaries shall continue to purchase during the period from the Closing
Date until the first anniversary of the Closing Date their requirements for
bearings products manufactured by the Business from the Business at a price
equal to the standard cost of such bearings products as of January 1, 2002
plus a margin of 20%.   5.27 Schedules. Sellers shall update each of
Schedules 3.9 and 3.16 as of the Closing Date. For all purposes of this
Agreement, Schedules 3.9 and 3.16 shall be deemed to include all of the
information contained in such updated Schedules, and the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.9 and 3.16 shall be deemed to be qualified
by reference to such updated Schedules as if such updated Schedules had been
a part of this Agreement as originally executed by the parties.   ARTICLE
VI  CONDITIONS TO THE SELLERS\' OBLIGATIONS   The obligation of the Sellers
to effect the Closing under this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction, at
or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions, unless validly
waived in writing by IR.   6.1 Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties made by the Buyers in this Agreement shall be
true and correct (in all material respects, in the case of those
representations and warranties which are not by their express terms qualified
by reference to materiality) as of the Closing Date as though such
representations and warranties were made at such date (except that any
representations and warranties that are made as of a specified date shall be
true and correct (in all material respects, in the case of those
representations and warranties which are not by their express terms qualified
by reference to materiality) as of such specified date), in each case except
for changes permitted or contemplated by this Agreement.   6.2 Performance.
The Buyers shall have performed and complied in all material respects with
all agreements and obligations required by this Agreement to be so performed
or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing.   6.3 Officer\'s
Certificates. Each of the Buyers shall have delivered to the Sellers a
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by an executive
officer each such Buyer, certifying to the fulfillment of the conditions
specified in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.   6.4 Governmental Approvals. All
Governmental Approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
listed on Schedule 6.4 shall have been obtained and all  
-75-   conditions relating to such Governmental Approvals shall have been
satisfied, including the completion of any sale, divestiture or disposition
of assets or businesses as may be required under Section 5.23(b).   6.5
Injunctions. At the Closing there shall not be in effect any Law or
Governmental Order which restrains, prohibits or declares illegal the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (which shall include

hold harmless each of the Buyers, their respective Affiliates (including,

below) prior to the Closing Date;   (iv) any Liabilities arising under or in
connection with  the pending or threatened Proceedings disclosed on Schedule
3.9 (other than  the Proceedings referred to in Item 6 of such Schedule);
provided that to  the extent there are, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
matters that should  have been listed on Schedule 3.9 but Sellers nonetheless
failed to list  such matters on Schedule 3.9, such matters shall be treated
as if they were  listed on Schedule 3.9;   (v) any requirement by any
Governmental Authority or  pursuant to Law to return any Continued Dumping
Offset payment (or a  portion thereof), whether received by a Sold Company or
Subsidiary prior to  the Closing or by Torrington, as agent for the Sellers
pursuant to Section  5.17, after the Closing;   (vi) any Release of any
Hazardous Material or any  violation of any Environmental Law, in each case
identified on Schedule  3.16; provided that to the extent there are, to the
Knowledge of the  Sellers, matters that should have been listed on Schedule
3.16 but Sellers  nonetheless failed to list such matters on Schedule 3.16,
such matters  shall be treated as if they were listed on Schedule 3.16;  
(vii) any Release of any Hazardous Material or any  violation of
Environmental Law not identified on Schedule 3.16 that relates  to the
Separate Assets, Sold Companies or Subsidiaries and that exists as  of, or
occurred or existed prior to, the Closing Date (the Losses referred  to in
clause (vi) and in this clause (vii) collectively, the "Environmental 
Liabilities");   (viii) any Release of any Hazardous Material or any 
violation of Environmental Law at or resulting from operations of any 
property owned or operated by the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries at any  time
prior to, but not at or after, the Closing Date;   (ix) Liabilities for
personal injury, death or property  damage to a third party arising out of
the sale of products by a Sold  Company or a Subsidiary or as part of the
Business (including discontinued  operations), but only to the extent that
such products that are the subject  of such claim are determined (as set
forth in Section 9.1(i) below) to have  been sold prior to the Closing
Date;   (x) actions taken by Torrington in compliance with  its obligations
pursuant to Section 5.17 (including its submission of  documents pursuant to
the USDOA in compliance with such Section and its  compliance with the
directions of IR pursuant to such Section); or   -79-    (xi) any
Excluded Liability.  Other than with respect to Losses arising out of or
related to the breach of the representations set forth in the first and
second sentences of Section 3.2, the first, second and last sentences of
Section 3.3, the third sentence of Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.23, none of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover from the Sellers
(i) for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9(a)(i), unless and
until the total of all Losses indemnifiable under Sections 9.1(a)(i) and
(iii) exceeds $12,000,000 or (ii) for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 9(a)(iii), unless and until the total of all Losses indemnifiable
under Section 9.1(a)(iii) exceeds $2,500,000, and then in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), only for the amount by which such Losses exceed such
amount; provided that in calculating whether the dollar amounts in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) have been obtained, only Losses under Sections
9.1(a)(i) and (iii) in excess of $50,000 shall be considered. For purposes of
the indemnified matters referred to in the proviso in Section 9.1(a)(iv),
except in the case of pending litigation, only Losses in excess of $50,000
shall be considered. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to
recover more than an aggregate of $400,000,000 from the Sellers with respect
to all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(i) and (iii). None of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons, individually or in the aggregate, shall be
entitled to recover from the Sellers under Section 9.1(a)(vii) any Losses in
excess of 70% of the total of the Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified
Persons that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under Section
9.1(a)(vii); provided, however, that in no event shall the liability of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to the foregoing exceed $10,000,000 in the
aggregate; and provided further that the limitation on recovery to 70% shall
not apply in any case, and Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
recovery of 100% of the total of such Losses, to the extent the Losses result
from (y) claims by a third party other than a Governmental Authority
asserting liability for personal injury, death or property damage caused by
exposure to Hazardous Material, or (z) conditions at locations (other than
the Real Property) at which Hazardous Material generated by a Sold Company or
a Subsidiary or in connection with the Business was present. No
indemnification claim under this Agreement may be asserted or pursued against
the Sellers by any entity that is a Sold Company or a Subsidiary as of the
Closing Date if such entity shall cease to be controlled by the Buyers.  
(b) Indemnification by the Buyers. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this ARTICLE IX and except as provided in Section 5.5, which shall
govern the parties\' respective indemnification obligations with respect to
Tax matters (including Tax representations and warranties), from and after
the Closing, the Buyers covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each of the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all Losses that any Seller Indemnified Person may incur or
suffer resulting from, arising out of or related to:   (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty by the  Buyers contained in this
Agreement;   (ii) any breach by the Buyers of any covenant, obligation  or
agreement hereunder;   -80-    (iii) the possession, use, operation or
management as of  and after the Closing of any property of the Sold
Companies, the  Subsidiaries, the Separate Assets or the Business or in any
other respect  regarding the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries, the Separate
Assets or the  Business as of and after the Closing Date except insofar as
the Buyer  Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification, subject to
the  limitations set forth in this Agreement, for Losses indemnifiable
pursuant  to Section 9.1(a); or   (iv) any Assumed Liability.  Other than
with respect to Losses arising out of or related to the breach of the
representations set forth in the first and second sentences of Section
4.2 and Section 4.14, none of the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to recover from the Buyers for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 9.1(b)(i) unless and until the total of all such Losses indemnifiable
under Section 9.1(b)(i) exceed $12,000,000 and then only for the amount by
which such Losses exceed such amount; provided that in calculating whether
the dollar amount in the foregoing clause has been obtained, only Losses
under Sections 9.1(b)(i) in excess of $50,000 shall be considered. The
Seller Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover more than an
aggregate of $400,000,000 from the Buyers pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i).  
(c) Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided for in
this ARTICLE IX, subject to the limitations set forth herein and except as
provided in Section 5.5, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available
to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of or resulting from
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, or the
Buyers\' ownership or operation of the Business; and, without limiting the
foregoing, indemnification provided pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(vi), (vii),
(viii) and 9.1(e) (but not pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), except in respect
of a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.16(c) or
(f) that survives the Closing Date) is the sole and exclusive post-Closing
remedy available to any party in connection with any matter relating to
Environmental Laws; provided further that nothing herein shall limit in any
way any such party\'s remedies in respect of fraud by the other party in
connection herewith or with any Transaction Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.   (d) Survival. All claims for
indemnification must be asserted on or prior to the date of the termination
of the respective survival periods set forth in this Section 9.1(d), except
such claims may be pursued thereafter if written notice thereof (specifying
in reasonable detail the basis for such claim) shall have been duly given
within such period. All claims for indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(vii)
must be asserted prior to the date that is the eighth anniversary of the
Closing Date, except such claims may be pursued thereafter if written notice
thereof (specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim) shall have
been duly given within such period. Claims for fraud may be asserted at any
time prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Except
as set forth above the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
to be performed following the Closing Date shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until the end of the period of applicable
performance. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the representations contained in
Sections 3.11 and 4.12) shall survive the Closing, but only to the
extent specified below:   -81-    (i) Except (i) to the extent set forth
below with  respect to the Seller Excluded Representations and the Buyer
Excluded  Representations, (ii) with respect to the representations in
subsections  3.16(a), (b), (d) and (e), which shall survive until the Closing
Date and  (iii) with respect to the representations contained in Section 3.11
and  Section 4.12 and the representations as to entity classification for
United  States federal income tax purposes contained in Section 3.3 and
Section  3.4, which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of  limitations, the representations and warranties contained in
ARTICLES III  and IV shall survive until the third anniversary of the
Closing;   (ii) the representations contained in the first and  second
sentences of Section 3.2, the second and last sentences of Section  3.3, and
the third sentence of Section 3.4(b) (the "Seller Excluded  Representations")
shall survive indefinitely; and   (iii) the representations contained in the
first and  second sentences of Section 4.2, the last sentence of Section
4.4(b) and  the first sentence Section 4.5 (the "Buyer Excluded
Representations") shall  survive indefinitely.   (e) Environmental Claims.
(i) The Buyers agree to cooperate with the Sellers and to take all
commercially reasonable actions to avoid and minimize Environmental Losses
that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a),
including not soliciting or importuning any Governmental Authority to require
any environmental correction, investigation, monitoring or remediation unless
affirmatively required to do so by Environmental Laws or unless the Buyers
reasonably believe that such actions will likely reduce the overall extent of
such Losses (subject to Sellers\' consent which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Nothing herein shall be construed to limit Buyers\'
right (at their own expense) to conduct investigations of the Real Property
(including sampling of soil, surface water, ground water, ambient and indoor
air, materials in any building or structure, and any other
environmental medium), and any Environmental Losses discovered pursuant to
any voluntary environmental investigation will be subject to indemnification
to the extent provided under Sections 9.1(a) and (e).   (ii) In addition to
any other limitations on  indemnification that may apply, with respect to any
claim for  indemnification any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons may assert
regarding  Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, none of the Sellers
shall have  any obligation with respect to such claim to the extent the
Losses for  which indemnification is sought:   (A) arise out of any breach
of Buyers\' covenants  under this Section 9.1(e);   (B) arise out of any
action not required under  Environmental Law or any action to meet a cleanup
standard  under Environmental Law that is more stringent or costly  than
necessary for the continued use of any property as it  was last used by the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries, the  Venture Entities or the Asset Sellers
prior to the Closing  Date, unless the Buyer Indemnified Persons agree to 
reimburse the Sellers for costs   -82-    necessary to meet such cleanup
standard;   (C) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing  construction,
demolition or renovation of facilities on the  Owned Real Property by a Buyer
Indemnified Party, including  any asbestos abatement obligations arising from
such  activities, but not including any Losses attributable to a  Release of
Hazardous Materials or violation of Environmental  Law that exists as of, or
occurred or existed prior to, the  Closing Date; or   (D) are, pursuant to
any written agreement under  which any of the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries is  entitled to assert a claim, subject to indemnification by 
any other Person, except where a Buyer, a Sold Company or a  Subsidiary has
in good faith sought and failed to obtain  such indemnification.   (iii) In
addition, with respect to any claim that is the  subject of this Section
9.1(e):   (A) it is a condition precedent to any right of the  Buyer
Indemnified Persons to indemnification for such claim  that, to the extent
reasonably practicable, prior to  incurring substantial costs with respect to
such claim for  which it may seek indemnification, such Buyer Indemnified 
Persons shall notify the Sellers of such claim and afford  the Sellers the
opportunity to evaluate the conditions  giving rise to such claim; provided,
however, that in the  event of an emergency that presents an imminent
likelihood  of personal injury or property damage, the Buyer Indemnified 
Parties may take action to address such emergency  immediately upon notice to
Sellers; however, Sellers may  exercise their rights under Section
9.1(e)(iii)(B) as soon  as feasible in the event of an emergency.   (B) the
Sellers, at their sole expense, shall be  entitled, but not obligated, to
undertake, with the Buyer  Indemnified Persons\' oversight, participation and
approval  (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed or to  unreasonably
result in material increased costs beyond those  required by Environmental
Law), any investigation,  remediation or other action required by
Environmental Law  (and any negotiation with Governmental Authorities
regarding  same) with respect to such matter, using all commercially 
reasonable efforts to avoid any interference with operations  of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons, and the Buyer Indemnified  Persons shall afford the
Sellers reasonable access to the  Real Property to undertake any such
investigation,  remediation or other action, subject, where such property
is  Leased Real Property, to the lawful requirements of the  Landlord;
provided, however, that:   (1) the Sellers shall promptly repair, restore 
or reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any  damages or other costs
incurred by the Buyer  Indemnified Persons as a result   -83-    of
providing access under this Section 9.1(e);   (2) the Sellers shall inform
the relevant  Governmental Authorities in writing that they have  assumed
responsibility with respect to any matter that  they elect to undertake
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)  and shall agree to be a party to, and
severally  responsible for compliance with, any work plan,  settlement or
other agreement developed or negotiated  pursuant to this subsection;   (3)
with respect to investigation or  remediation of any Real Property, Sellers
shall  accommodate (without prejudice to Sellers\' option to  undertake
control or not) any request by any Buyer  Indemnified Person to incorporate
in Sellers\' work  additional work beyond that required to satisfy 
Environmental Law, provided that such Buyer Indemnified  Person agrees to
reimburse Sellers for the incremental  cost to Sellers of making such
accommodation;   (C) if Sellers do not assume responsibility for 
undertaking actions pursuant to Section 9.1(e)(iii), the  Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall undertake, with the Sellers\'  oversight and participation, in
good faith, to complete such  actions in a reasonably cost effective
manner;   (D) to the extent there is a risk of litigation and  sharing
relevant information or communications between  Sellers and Buyers could
affect their status as privileged  or otherwise protected, the Buyers, the
Sellers, the Sold  Companies and the Subsidiaries shall exchange
information  pursuant to the protection of a joint defense agreement and 
shall otherwise cooperate in order to facilitate the  expeditious and cost-
effective resolution of such claim; and   (E) where reasonably necessary to
achieve the purpose  of Section 9.1(e)(ii)(B), the Buyer Indemnified
Parties  shall, at Sellers\' request, impose environmental deed or use 
restrictions, and/or accept Sellers\' installation of  engineering controls
on the Owned Real Property, provided  that such restrictions or controls do
not prevent or inhibit  any uses of such Owned Real Property that occurred as
of the  Closing Date.   (iv) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall permit
the  Sellers to make use of Hazardous Material treatment systems located on
the  Real Property as of the Closing Date for purposes of meeting their 
indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(a); provided, however, that:  
(A) the Buyer Indemnified Persons, and not the  Sellers, shall have the
exclusive right to operate and  maintain such systems;   (B) the Sellers
shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnified  Persons   -84-    for the
reasonable pro rata costs of operation and  maintenance attributable to the
Sellers\' usage of such  systems;   (C) with respect to Environmental
Losses identified  on Schedule 3.16 that are, as of the Closing Date, being 
addressed by the Sellers, in whole or in part, through use  of such existing
Hazardous Material treatment systems, the  Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
provide Sellers with access  equal to the treatment capacity that was
required for such  ongoing works as of the Closing Date and, at Sellers\' 
request, shall make additional treatment capacity available  for such ongoing
work as needed, to the extent that such  treatment systems have treatment
capacity in excess of that  required by the operations of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons;  and   (D) with respect to Environmental Losses not
subject  to Section 9.1(e)(iv)(C), the Buyer Indemnified Persons  shall only
be required to provide the Sellers with access to  such systems to the extent
that there is treatment capacity  in excess of that required by the
operations of the Buyer  Indemnified Persons.   (v) To the extent that the
remediation of a Release  is otherwise subject to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 9.1, if  the applicable remedial standards provided for under
applicable  Environmental Laws change between the Closing Date and the date
removal or  remedial actions are performed, then Sellers\' indemnity
obligations shall  include meeting applicable remedial standards as in effect
at the time such  removal or remedial actions are performed.   (f)
Indemnification Calculations. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b)(i)
shall be computed net of any third party insurance proceeds received by the
indemnified party in connection with such Losses. If an indemnified
party receives such insurance proceeds in connection with such Losses for
which it has received indemnification, such party shall refund to the
indemnifying party the amount of such insurance proceeds when received, up to
the amount of indemnification received. An indemnified party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue third party insurance claims with
respect to any such Losses. The amount of the refunded reduction shall be
deemed a payment under this Section and thus shall be paid subject to any
applicable reductions under this Section. The parties agree that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by Law.   (g) Notice and Opportunity to Defend. If there occurs
an event which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section
9.1(a) or 9.1(b), the party or parties seeking indemnification shall notify
the other party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") promptly. If such event involves any claim or the
commencement of any action or Proceeding by a third person, the party seeking
indemnification will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of
such claim or the commencement of such action or Proceeding; provided,
however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein
will   -85-   relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
only to the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. In case any such action shall be brought against any party seeking
indemnification and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party who shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to such party or parties seeking indemnification of such
election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to the party or parties seeking indemnification hereunder for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such party or parties in connection with the defense thereof. The
Indemnifying Party and the party seeking indemnification agree to cooperate
fully with each other and their respective counsel in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such action or asserted Liability.
The party or parties seeking indemnification shall have the right to
participate at their own expense in the defense of such action or asserted
Liability; provided that if the indemnified party has been advised in writing
by outside counsel that there is a potential conflict between the interests
of the Indemnifying Party and the indemnified party, the reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses of one separate counsel for the indemnified party
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of an action, no settlement or compromise thereof may be
effected (i) by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the
indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless all relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) by the indemnified party without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party. In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be Liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent.   (h)
Determination of Sale Date. For purposes of Sections 9.1(a)(iii) and (ix), in
the event that the date of sale of a product of the Business cannot otherwise
be determined, with respect to such products sold to each of the following
types of customers, such date of sale shall (i) in the case of OEMs, be
deemed to be 60 days prior to the manufacture date of the indicated finished
goods of such customers and (ii) in the case of distributors, be deemed to be
90 days prior to the sale of the indicated finished goods by such
distributors.   ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS   10.1 Fees and Expenses. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, IR,

Buyers, on the other hand, shall bear its own expenses and the expenses of

prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date a registration statement for an offering
to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act registering the resale from time to time by the Holders of all
of the Registrable Securities (the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Shelf
Registration Statement shall permit resales of Registrable Securities by the
Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (including, without
limitation, one or more underwritten offerings, subject to Section 2(c)
hereof, and including any offering or distribution of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the terms of any convertible or other security of any Holder or
IR, including, without limitation, any DECs or other similar securities (the
"Related Securities")). The Company shall not permit any securities other
than Registrable Securities or Company Common Stock to be sold for its own
account to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Shelf Registration Statement to remain continuously effective under the
Securities Act for a period ending on the earliest of (i) the date on which
all Registrable Securities which have not theretofore been sold to the public
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement could be sold to the public
pursuant to paragraph (k) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (ii) the date
on which there cease to be any Registrable Securities outstanding and (iii)
the date when all the Registrable Securities have been sold to the public
pursuant to such registration statement in accordance with the intended
method of distribution thereof. Subject to Section 2(c), if one or more
Holders proposes to sell Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, such Holder or Holders may
request the Company in writing to effect such underwritten offering by
supplement or amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, stating the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold, and the Company shall
effect such underwritten offering subject to the terms of this Agreement. The
Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any
registration pursuant to this Section 2.   (ii) Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 2(a) to the contrary, the Company may take action that would
result in any Holder of Registrable Securities being unable to offer and sell
Registrable Securities under a Shelf Registration Statement that has been
filed pursuant to this Section 2(a) if (x) the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith after consultation with counsel that such
action is required by applicable law, (y) the filing or use of the Shelf
Registration Statement may require the Company to disclose material
information, and the board of directors of the Company has determined, in the
good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that such disclosure
is not in the best interests of the Company, or (z) the Company is
contemplating or engaged in an underwritten public offering of Company Common
Stock for its own account (other than an offering pursuant to Form S-8, S-4
or any successor or similar form) and the managing underwriter has advised
the Company that such offers and sales by the Holders will adversely affect
such public offering; provided that in no event may the Company exercise the
right to prevent a Holder from offering   -3-   or selling Registrable
Securities by use of the Shelf Registration Statement (including pursuant to
an underwritten offering thereunder) pursuant to this clause (z) within 365
days after the expiration of the restricted periods set forth in Section 4
hereof applicable to the Company and the Holders following the closing of any
registered public offering by the Company of Company Common Stock (or
securities convertible into or exercisable for Company Common Stock) after
the Closing Date, other than a registration on Form S-8, S-4 or any successor
or similar forms. Each period referred to above during which the use of the
Shelf Registration Statement is suspended in accordance with this clause (ii)
shall be referred to herein as a "Deferral Period". Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will a Deferral Period exceed 45 days. In no event
shall the Company be entitled to declare more than two Deferral Periods in
any 365-day period. The Company shall promptly give the Holders written
notice of a determination to commence a Deferral Period, which notice shall
contain a general statement of the reasons for, and the anticipated length
of, such Deferral Period, and shall notify the Holders upon the termination
of each Deferral Period.   (b) Demand Registration. If the book-runner(s)
for any underwritten offering of Related Securities pursuant to this Section
2 advises the Company that it is of material importance to the success of the
proposed offering that either (i) the offering be effected pursuant to a
registration statement other than a Shelf Registration Statement or (ii)
information be included in the Shelf Registration Statement that is not
required by Form S-3, then the Company shall file a registration statement on
such other form, or shall include such other information in the Shelf
Registration Statement, as the case may be, as the book-runner(s) for such
underwritten offering shall so request. All references in this Agreement to a
"Shelf Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to refer to any other
registration statement filed in accordance with this Section 2(b).   (c)
Limitations and other Provisions Concerning Underwritten Offerings. (i)
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2 to the contrary:   (A) in no
event will the Holders be entitled to request the Company to effect an
underwritten offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement unless no less than 25% of the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities originally held by IR (or, if less than such number of
Registrable Securities are then Registrable Securities, all of the remaining
Registrable Securities) are proposed to be sold pursuant to such underwritten
offering, and   (B) in no event will the Holders be entitled to request
the Company to effect more than an aggregate of two underwritten
offerings pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, and   (ii) an
underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 2 shall not be deemed to have
been effected unless the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective
and remained effective in compliance with the provisions of the Securities
Act (subject to the restrictions referred to in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof)
until such time as all of the Registrable Securities offered in such
underwritten offering have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition thereof set forth in such Shelf
Registration Statement.   -4-     (d) Selection of Book-Runners;
Underwriting Arrangements. In any underwritten offering pursuant to this
Section 2, the participating Holders (or if IR is participating, IR) and the
Company shall each have the right to select one book-runner and such co-book
runners shall be the sole book-runners for any such offering. The Company
(together with the Holders) shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting, as well as all other documents customary in similar offerings,
including, without limitation, custody agreements, powers of attorney and
indemnification agreements, as applicable. In any underwritten offering
pursuant to this Section 2, the co-book-runners shall share equally in the
management fee relating to such underwritten offering and the book-runner
selected by the Company shall have the lead position on the cover page of any
prospectus used in connection with such underwritten offering.   (e)
Priority in Registrations. If the book-runner(s) for an underwritten offering
pursuant to this Section 2 advises the Company and the applicable Holders in
writing that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be
included in such offering by the Company, if any, and the Holders exceeds the
largest number or amount of securities which can be sold without reasonably
expecting to have an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at
which such securities can be sold, the number of such securities to be
included in such registration shall be reduced to such extent, and the
Company shall include in such registration the number of securities as
follows: (i) first, all the Registrable Securities requested to be included
in such registration by the Holders which in the opinion of such book-
runner(s) can be sold without adverse effect on the offering, allocated, if
the amount is less than all the Registrable Securities to be sold, pro
rata among the Holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by such Holders, and
(ii) second, to the extent that the number of Registrable Securities which
the Holders have requested to be included in such registration is less than
the number or amount of securities which the Company has been advised by its
book-runner can be sold in such offering without having the adverse effect
referred to above, as many of the securities which the Company proposes to
sell for its own account, if any, as can be sold in such offering without
having such adverse effect referred to above. If any Holder advises the book-
runner(s) of any underwritten offering that the Registrable Securities
covered by the registration statement cannot be sold in such offering within
a price range acceptable to such Holder, then such Holder shall have the
right to exclude its Registrable Securities from registration.   3.
Incidental Registration.   (a) Rights to Include Registrable Securities. At
any time after the Closing Date and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 3.3 of the Standstill and Voting Agreement, if the
Company proposes to register (other than pursuant to Section 2 hereof) any of
its securities under the Securities Act (other than a registration on Form
S-8, S-4 or any successor or similar forms), whether or not for sale for its
own account (and including any registration pursuant to a request or demand
registration right of any other person), then the Company will, each such
time (until such time as there cease to be any Registrable Securities),
subject to the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof, give prompt written notice
to the Holders of its intention to do so and of the Holders\' rights under
this Section 3, at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated filing
date of the registration statement relating to such registration. Such notice
shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in such registration
statement, subject to    -5-   Section 3(c) hereof, such number of
Registrable Securities as each Holder may request: provided that if the
Company\'s notice pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall have been given prior
to the expiration of the lock-up period in Section 3.3(a) of the Standstill
and Voting Agreement then the Holders shall only have the right to include
Registrable Securities in such registration statement if the aggregate number
of Registrable Securities requested to be included by all requesting Holders
exceeds 4,000,000 shares or if less than such number of Registrable
Securities are then Registrable Securities, all of the remaining Registrable
Securities. Upon the written request of any Holder made within 15 business
days after the receipt of the Company\'s notice (which request shall specify
the information required by the penultimate paragraph of Section 5 hereof, it
being understood, however, that the failure to include any such information
in such request shall not result in a forfeiture of such Holder\'s right to
include its Registrable Securities but that the Company shall not be required
to include such Registrable Securities unless and until such Holder complies
with such penultimate paragraph), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to effect the proposed registration under the Securities Act of all
Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by
such Holder; provided that (i) if such registration involves an underwritten
offering, any such Holder must sell its Registrable Securities to the
underwriters selected by the Company on the same terms and conditions as
those that apply to similar securities of the Company to be registered
thereunder (subject to differences customary in combined primary and
secondary offerings and except that the indemnification obligations of
any such Holder, as between such Holder and the Company, shall be limited to
those obligations set forth in Section 6 hereof) and (ii) if, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities
pursuant to this Section 3(a) and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to register such securities, the
Company shall give written notice to each such Holder and, thereupon, shall
be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in
connection with such registration. Any such Holder may elect, in writing no
less than five business days prior to the anticipated effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, not to
register such securities in connection with such registration. Upon any such
election, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations to
such Holder pursuant to this Section 3 with respect to such registration
statement. No registration effected under this Section 3 shall relieve the
Company of its obligations under Section 2 hereof with respect to Registrable
Securities not registered and sold pursuant to this Section 3. If upon such
election, the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such
registration statement by the Holders does not exceed 4,000,000 shares (or if
less than such number of Registrable Securities are then Registrable
Securities, all of the remaining Registrable Securities), then no Registrable
Securities shall be included in such registration statement and the Company
shall nevertheless be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this
Section 3 with respect to such offering (but shall be obligated to comply
with all provisions of this Section 3 with respect to any subsequent
offering). The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with
each registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to this
Section 3.   (b) Selection of Book-Runners; Underwriting Arrangements. In
any underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 3 occurring after the six
month anniversary of the Closing Date in which the participating Holders and
IR propose to include shares of Company Common Stock, each of IR and the
Company shall have the right to select one book-runner and such co-book-
runners shall be the sole book-runners for any such offering. In any
underwritten offering   -6-   pursuant to this Section 3, the co-book-
runners shall share equally in the management fee relating to such
underwritten offering and the book-runner selected by the Company shall have
the lead position on the cover page of any prospectus used in connection with
such underwritten offering.   (c) Priority in Incidental Registrations. If
the book-runner selected by the Company for an underwritten offering pursuant
to this Section 3 advises the Company in writing that, in its opinion, the
number or amount of securities (including all Registrable Securities) which
the Company, the Holders and any other persons intend to include in such
registration exceeds the largest number or amount of securities which can be
sold without having an adverse effect on such offering, including the price
at which such securities can be sold, the number or amount of such securities
to be included in such registration shall be reduced to such extent, and the
Company will include in such registration such maximum number or amount of
securities as follows:   (i) During the six-month period following the
Closing Date, (A) first, there shall be included the securities initially
proposed by the Company to be included in such registration for its own
account, (B) second, to the extent that the number or amount of securities
which the Company proposes to sell for its own account is less than the
number or amount of securities that the Company has been advised by the book-
runner selected by the Company can be sold in such offering without adverse
effect on the offering, there shall be included in such registration all
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by the
Holders, but only to the extent such adverse effect shall be avoided, and
such securities of such Holders shall be allocated pro rata among such
Holders on the basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration statement, and (C) third, to
the extent that the number of securities which the Company proposes to
include for its own account and the Holders propose to include in such
registration is less, in the aggregate, than the number of securities which
the Company has been advised by its book-runner can be sold in such offering
without having the adverse effect referred to above, there shall be included
all other securities (other than Registrable Securities) requested to be
included in such registration by holders other than the Holders, but only to
the extent such adverse effect shall be avoided, and such securities of such
holders shall be allocated pro rata among such holders on the basis of the
relative number or amount of such securities then held by each such holder;
provided that any such number or amount thereby allocated to each such Holder
or holder that exceeds such Holder\'s or holder\'s request shall be
reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders or holders, as the case
may be, in like manner or amount of such securities then held by each such
Holder or holder; and   (ii) During the period following the date that is
six- months after the Closing Date, (A) first, the securities to be included
in such registration shall be allocated pro rata among the securities
initially proposed by the Company to be included in such registration for its
own account and the number of Registrable Securities initially requested to
be included in such registration by the Holders, on the basis of the
relative number or amount of the securities to be included in such
registration by the Company, on the one hand, and by each such Holder (such
Registrable Securities to be so included shall be allocated pro rata among
the Holders on the basis of the relative number of such Registrable
Securities then held by each such Holder), on the other hand, and (B) second,
to the extent that the number or amount of securities which the  
-7-   Company, for its own account, and the Holders propose to sell
pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof is less than the number or amount of
securities which the Company has been advised by its book-runner can be sold
in such offering without having the adverse effect referred to above, then
there shall be included in such registration statement all other securities
(other than Registrable Securities) requested to be included in such
registration by holders other than the Holders, but only to the extent such
adverse effect shall be avoided, and such securities of such holders shall be
allocated pro rata among such holders on the basis of the relative number or
amount of such securities then held by each such holder.   4. Holdback
Agreements.   (a) Restrictions on Public Sale by the Holders. In connection
with any underwritten public offering pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof,
each Holder including Registrable Securities in such offering agrees that,
upon request of the book-runner(s) for such offering, it shall not effect any
sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, of any Registrable Securities during the 15 days prior to,
and during such period as the book-runner(s) may request (not to exceed 90
days) beginning on, the offering date of Company Common Stock pursuant to
an effective registration statement, except as part of such registration.  
(b) Restrictions on the Public Sale by the Company. In connection with any
underwritten public offering pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof, the Company
agrees (i) not to effect any public sale or distribution of any securities
substantially similar to the Registrable Securities (other than in connection
with an employee stock option or other benefit plan) during the 15 days prior
to, and during such period as the book-runner(s) may request (not to exceed
90 days) beginning on, the offering date of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement (except as part of such
registration), (ii) that any agreement entered into after the date of this
Agreement pursuant to which the Company issues or agrees to issue
any privately placed Company Common Stock or other securities
substantially similar to the Registrable Securities shall contain a provision
under which holders of such securities agree not to effect any sale or
distribution of any such securities during the period referred to in the
foregoing clause (i), including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (except as part of such registration, if permitted) and (iii)
to use its reasonable best efforts to cause any other Person that executes
and delivers a "lock-up" agreement in connection with a Qualifying Public
Offering to enter into an agreement on substantially the same terms as those
set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) with the underwriters of an
underwritten public offering pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof.   5.
Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is required to use its
reasonable best efforts to effect or cause the registration of
any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this
Agreement, the Company will, as expeditiously as possible:   (a) prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on the form required by this
Agreement or (if no particular form is specified pursuant hereto) on any
other form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the
Company shall deem appropriate, and which form shall be available for the
sale of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended methods of
distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such  
-8-   registration statement to become and remain effective as promptly
as practicable (except as otherwise specified in Section 2(a) in the case of
the Shelf Registration Statement); provided, that a reasonable time before
filing with the SEC a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments
or supplements thereto (other than deemed post-effective amendments due to
the filing by the Company of periodic reports under the Exchange Act), the
Company will furnish to each Holder copies of the form of registration
statement or preliminary prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto
proposed to be filed and furnish to counsel to the Holders copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review
of the Holders and such counsel and shall not be filed without the approval
of the Holders, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed;   (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to (A) effect dispositions of
Registrable Securities thereunder in accordance with the intended method of
distribution by the Holders and (B) keep such registration statement
effective (i) with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement, for the
period specified in Section 2(a), and (ii) with respect to all other
registration statements, for a period of not less than 120 days or such
shorter period which will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered
by such registration statement have been sold; and comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities
covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with
the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such
registration statement;   (c) promptly furnish to each Holder and each
underwriter, if any, of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement such number of copies of such registration statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all financial
statements, schedules and exhibits thereto), the prospectus included in such
registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act, copies of any correspondence
with the SEC or its staff relating to the registration statement and such
other documents as the Holders or underwriters may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities;   (d)
use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as
each Holder or each underwriter, if any, reasonably requests and do any and
all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable each Holder and each underwriter, if any, to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
provided that the Company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do
business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any
such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any
such jurisdiction;   (e) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such other Governmental Entity as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company to enable
the Holders to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities,
except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of the
selling Holder\'s business, in which case the   -9-   Company will
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such registration
statement and the granting of such approvals;   (f) promptly notify the
Holders at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event which comes
to the Company\'s attention if as a result of such event the prospectus
included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the
Company will promptly prepare and furnish to each Holder a supplement or
amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading;   (g) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of
and obtain the withdrawal of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
a registration statement relating to the Registrable Securities or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary or final prospectus
at the earliest practicable moment;   (h) if requested in writing by the
managing underwriter or underwriters or any Holder, promptly incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the
managing underwriters and any such Holder reasonably agree should be included
therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the plan of
distribution with respect to such Registrable Securities or information with
respect to the number or amount of Registrable Securities being sold to such
underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and
any other terms of the underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering
of the Registrable Securities; and make all required filings of each such
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable
after notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment;   (i) cooperate with the Holders
and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold
and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such Registrable
Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the
managing underwriters may request prior to any sale of the Registrable
Securities to the underwriters;   (j) use its reasonable best efforts to
cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on a national securities
exchange or automated quotation system and on each securities exchange or
quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then
listed, and enter into such customary agreements including a listing
application and listing agreement in customary form, provided that the
applicable listing requirements are satisfied, and to provide a transfer
agent and registrar for such Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement no later than the effective date of such registration
statement and to maintain such listing for the period of effectiveness of
such registration statement;   (k) enter into such customary agreements
(including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such
other actions as the Holders or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request
in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities,   -10-   including providing customary indemnification,
supporting each such Holder\'s efforts to execute block trades with
institutional buyers and, with respect to an underwritten offering pursuant
to this Agreement, making appropriate members of senior management of the
Company available (subject to consulting with them in advance as to schedule)
for customary participation in telephonic, in-person conferences or "road
show" presentations to potential investors;   (l) make available for
inspection by the Holders, any underwriter participating in any disposition
pursuant to such registration statement, one counsel for all such Holders and
one counsel for all such underwriters, and any accountant or other agent
retained by any such Holder or underwriter (collectively, the "Inspectors"),
all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, as shall be reasonably necessary
to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the
Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' officers, directors and employees to supply
all information and respond to all inquiries reasonably requested by any such
Inspector in connection with such registration statement (collectively, the
"Records"); provided, that the Company may require, as a condition to the
provision to any Inspector of any Records, that such Inspector execute and
deliver to the Company a written agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, pursuant to which such Inspector agrees to the
confidential treatment of such Records;   (m) in connection with any
underwritten offering pursuant to such registration statement, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to
the Company and (ii) a "cold comfort" letter or letters from the Company\'s
independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by opinions and "cold comfort" letters as the
Holders or the underwriter requests;   (n) otherwise use its reasonable best
efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and
make available to its security holders, within the required time periods, an
earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months, beginning
with the first fiscal quarter of the Company after the effective date of the
registration statement (as the term "effective date" is defined in Rule
158(c) under the Securities Act), which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder or
any successor provisions thereto;   (o) promptly notify the Holders,
counsel to the Holders and the managing underwriter or agent, (i) when the
registration statement, or any post-effective amendment to the registration
statement, shall have become effective, or any supplement to the prospectus
or any amendment to the prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC, (iii) of any request of the SEC to amend the
registration statement or amend or supplement the prospectus or for
additional information, and (iv) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the
suspension of the qualification of the registration statement for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution or threatening of any
proceedings for any of such purposes; and   (p) cooperate with each selling
Holder and each underwriter or agent participating in the disposition of such
Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with  
-11-   any filings required to be made with the New York Stock Exchange or
any other applicable securities exchange and/or the NASD.   It shall be a
condition precedent to the obligation of the Company to take any action
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Registrable Securities which are
to be registered at the request of any Holder that any such Holder shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding the Registrable Securities
held by any such Holder and the intended method of disposition thereof as the
Company shall reasonably request in order to comply with the applicable rules
of the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with such
registration. Such information shall include, without limitation, (i) the
full name and address of the registered and beneficial owner of the
Registrable Securities to be registered, (ii) the number of Registrable
Securities to be registered, (iii) the number and type of other securities of
the Company (including other Registrable Securities) held by the Holder, and
(iv) the method or methods of disposition of Registrable Securities to be
registered.   Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(f)
hereof or condition described in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof, each such Holder
will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Holder receives the copies of the prospectus supplement or amendment
contemplated by Section 5(f) hereof or notice from the Company of the
termination of the Deferral Period, and, if so directed by the Company, each
such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company\'s expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder\'s possession,
of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that was current at
the time of receipt of such notice.   6. Indemnification.   (a)
Indemnification by the Company. In the event of any registration of any
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 2 or 3
hereof, the Company will, and it hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to
the full extent permitted by law, each Holder, its directors and officers,
employees, stockholders, general partners, limited partners, members,
advisory directors, managing directors (and directors,
officers, stockholders, general partners, limited partners, members, advisory
directors, managing directors and controlling persons thereof), each other
person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such
securities and each other person, if any, who controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with each such Holder or any such underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act, against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, and expenses (including any
reasonable attorneys\' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any investigation, litigation
or other action commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and
all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation) ("Losses") to
which any such Holder, any such director, or officer, employee, stockholder,
general or limited partner, member, or advisory or managing director or any
such underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the
Securities Act, state securities or blue sky laws, common law or otherwise
insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any
registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were
registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any   -12-   amendment or supplement
thereto or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made), and the Company will reimburse
each such Holder and each such director, officer, employee, general partner,
limited partner, advisory director, managing director or underwriter and
controlling person for any legal or any other expenses incurred by them
as such expenses are incurred in connection with investigating or
defending against such Loss or any action or proceeding in respect thereof;
provided that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto or in any such
preliminary, final or summary prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company through any such Holder or
any such director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, managing
director or underwriter specifically stating that it is for use in the
preparation thereof; and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue
statement or omission of material fact made in any prospectus, the indemnity
agreement in this Section 6(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder
or underwriter from whom the person asserting any such Loss purchased the
Registrable Securities concerned, to the extent that any such Loss of such
person occurs under circumstances where it shall have been determined that
(w) the Company had previously furnished copies of a supplemented prospectus
to such Holder or underwriter, (x) delivery of a prospectus was required by
the Securities Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or
omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary, final or summary
prospectus was corrected in such supplement thereto and (z) there was not
sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the
sale of such Registrable Securities to such person, a copy of the prospectus
as so supplemented.   (b) Indemnification by Holders and Underwriters. Any
Holder and any underwriter will, and they hereby do, indemnify and hold
harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section
6(a) hereof) the Company and its directors, officers, employees, controlling
persons and all other prospective sellers and their respective directors,
officers, general and limited partners, managing directors, and their
respective controlling persons, against any and all Losses to which the
Company and its directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or any
other prospective sellers and their respective directors, officers, general
and limited partners, managing directors, and their respective controlling
persons may become subject under the Securities Act, state securities or blue
sky laws, common law or otherwise insofar as such Losses arise out of or are
based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained, on the effective date thereof, in any registration
statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made), and any such Holder and any underwriter will reimburse the Company and
its directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and all other
prospective sellers and their respective directors, officers, general and
limited partners, managing directors, and their respective controlling
persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them as
such expenses are incurred in connection with investigating or defending
against such Loss or any   -13-   action or proceeding in respect
thereof; provided that any such Holder and any underwriter shall only be
liable in any such case if any such Loss (or action or proceeding in respect
thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto or in any such
preliminary, final summary prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by any such Holder or any such
underwriter specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation
thereof. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director,
officer, employee or controlling person. No Holder shall be liable under this
Section 6 for any amounts exceeding the product of the purchase price per
Registrable Security and the number of Registrable Securities being sold
pursuant to such registration statement by any such Holder.   (c) Notices
of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect
to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 6,
such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against an indemnifying party, promptly give written notice to the latter of
the commencement of such action or proceeding; provided that the failure of
any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subsections of this
Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action
or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party
will be entitled to participate in and, jointly with any other indemnifying
party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, to the extent that
it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party will have the right to
employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of
such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party,
(ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to employ counsel to take
charge of the defense within a reasonable time after commencement of the
action or proceeding, or (iii) the indemnified party shall have concluded
that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in
addition to the defenses available to one or more indemnifying party. An
indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
No indemnifying party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding which (x) does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to all indemnified parties of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or litigation or (y) involves the imposition of
equitable remedies or the imposition of any other obligations on such
indemnified party other than financial obligations fully indemnified by the
indemnifying party hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, an indemnifying party will not be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate
local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim.   (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided
for in this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section
6(a) or Section 6(b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in
those Sections) in respect of any Losses, then each applicable  
-14-   indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i)
the relative benefits received by the Company from the issuance of the
Registrable Securities sold by the applicable Holder, on the one hand, and by
such Holder from the sale of its Registrable Securities, on the other, or,
(ii) solely if the allocation provided for in clause (i) is not permitted by
applicable law, to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Holders,
on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted
in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the applicable
Holders, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company or such applicable Holders and the
parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable
by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 6(a) and 6(b), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating
or defending any action, proceeding or claim.   The Company and each Holder
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Holder shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Registrable Securities sold by any such Holder and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
any damages which any such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.   (e) Non-Exclusivity. The obligations of the parties
under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which any party
may otherwise have to any other party.   (f) Indemnification Payments. The
indemnification and contribution required by Sections 6(a), 6(b) and 6(d)
shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of
the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense,
loss, damage or liability is incurred.   7. Miscellaneous.   (a) Remedies.
The Company and the Holders acknowledge and agree that in the event of any
breach of this Agreement by any of them, the Holders and the Company would be
irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Each
party accordingly agrees (i) to waive the defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) that the parties,
in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in
equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of this
Agreement.   -15-    (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
contained herein, and there are no restrictions, promises, representations,
warranties, covenants or undertakings with respect to the subject matter
hereof, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein, in the
Purchase Agreement or in the Transaction Agreements. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Purchase Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements).   (c) Notices. Any notice, request,
instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party hereto to
another party hereto shall be in writing, shall be delivered personally or
sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, or by Federal Express or other delivery service, to the address of
the party set forth below or to such other address as the party to whom
notice is to be given may provide in a written notice to the Company, a copy
of which written notice shall be maintained on file with the Secretary of the

the Services (it being understood that Services rendered for any particular
month shall include the preparation and delivery of any required reports,
filings or other work related to such month even though performed after the
end of the particular month in question). The applicable fee for each Service

anniversary of the Closing Date 50% of the specified fee for such Service set
forth in Schedule A, (ii) from the second month anniversary of the Closing
Date until the fourth month anniversary of the Closing Date 100% of the

own funds for any third party-provided service that is requested by Buyer or
any payment obligation of Buyer (including employee compensation payments,
employee benefit payments and payments to fund checks issued or wire transfer
payments made on behalf of Buyer). Buyer shall be responsible to provide
Seller with the funds for each such service and shall be solely responsible
for the payment of any additional license fees, royalties and other payments
and fees (including licensee fees and application service provider fees) due
under any license agreement or other agreement relating to intellectual
property (including software) necessary to perform the Services incurred
after the prior approval of Buyer as a result of the performance of the
Services for the Buyer. In every case, all of the Services shall be provided
in accordance with the terms, limitations and conditions set forth herein and
on Schedule A.   SECTION 2.2. Access. Buyer shall make available on
a timely basis to Seller all information and materials reasonably requested
by Seller to enable it to provide the Services. Buyer shall give
Seller reasonable access, during regular business hours and at such other
times as are reasonably required, to the premises of the Sold Companies
and Subsidiaries for the purposes of providing Services.   SECTION 2.3.

provided and reasonable supporting documentation of all charges and expenses

reasonable notice, during normal business hours.   ARTICLE III SERVICES;
PAYMENT; INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR    SECTION 3.1. Service Quality.   (a)
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Services shall be
performed by Seller for Buyer in a manner and quality that are substantially
consistent with Seller\'s past practice in performing the Services for the
Business, and Buyer shall use such Services in substantially the same manner
as they were used by Seller in the past practice of the Business. Seller
shall act under this Agreement solely as an independent contractor and not as
an agent of Buyer. All employees and representatives providing the Services
shall be under the direction, control and supervision of Seller (and not of
Buyer), and Seller shall have the sole right to exercise all authority with
respect to such employees and representatives and in no event shall
such employees and representatives be deemed to be employees or agents
of Buyer.   (b) Seller shall have the right to shut down temporarily for
routine maintenance purposes the operation of the facilities providing
any Service whenever in its judgment, reasonably exercised, such action
is necessary, provided, that such shut down shall not adversely and unduly
affect Buyer\'s operations to which the provision of Services relate. In the
event maintenance is nonscheduled, Seller shall notify Buyer as much in
advance as reasonably practicable that maintenance is required. Unless not
feasible under the circumstances, this notice shall be given in writing.
Where written notice is not feasible, Seller shall give prompt oral notice,
which notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by Seller. Seller shall
be relieved of its obligations to provide Services only for the period of
time that its facilities are so shut down but shall use diligent and
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize each period of shutdown for such
purpose and to schedule such shutdown so as not to inconvenience or disrupt
the conduct of the Business by Buyer. Seller shall consult with Buyer prior
to temporary shutdowns to the extent reasonably practicable or, if not
reasonably practicable, immediately thereafter in order to establish
alternative sources for such services. To the extent commercially reasonable,
Seller will afford Buyer the benefit of any arrangements for substitute
services that Seller makes on its own behalf.   SECTION 3.2. Payment.
Statements will be rendered each month by Seller to Buyer for Services
delivered during the preceding month. Each such statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail a description of such Services and the amounts charged
therefor and shall be payable 30 days after the date thereof. Any amount not
paid within such 30-day period, unless such amount is being challenged, shall
be subject to late charges at a rate of 10% per annum for each day that such
amount is overdue.   SECTION 3.3. Priorities. In providing Services,
Seller shall accord Buyer the same priority it accords its own
operations.    -3-    SECTION 3.4. Taxes. The amounts set forth for each
Service on Schedule A do not include any Taxes. Any Taxes required to be
charged by Seller under applicable Law are in addition to the amounts to be
paid by Buyer hereunder for the Services.   SECTION 3.5. Uses of Services.
Seller shall be required to provide Services only to Buyer in connection with
the Buyer\'s operation of the Business. Buyer shall not resell any Services
to any Person whatsoever or permit the use of the Services by any Person
other than in connection with the operation of the Business in the ordinary
course by Buyer and its subsidiaries.   ARTICLE IV TERM OF SERVICES   
The provision of Services shall commence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate nine months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that: (i)
Buyer may cancel any Service upon 30 days\' written notice of cancellation
and (ii) Seller may cease to provide a Service upon 90 days\' written notice
to Buyer if Seller ceases to provide such Service to all of Seller\'s
subsidiaries, divisions and business units. Upon termination of any Services
pursuant to this Article IV, except as set forth in Section 7.3, Buyer\'s
obligation to pay Seller for such Services will cease.   ARTICLE V FORCE
MAJEURE    Seller shall not be liable for any interruption, delay
or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement when such
interruption, delay or failure results from causes beyond its reasonable
control, including, but not limited to, any strikes, lockouts or other labor
difficulties, acts of any government, riot, insurrection or other
hostilities, embargo, fuel or energy shortage, fire, flood, acts of God,
wrecks or transportation delays, or inability to obtain necessary labor,
materials or utilities. In any such event, Seller\'s obligations hereunder
shall be postponed for such time as its performance is suspended or delayed
on account thereof. Seller will promptly notify Buyer, either orally or in
writing, upon learning of the occurrence of such event of force majeure. Upon
the cessation of the force majeure event, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to resume its performance with the least possible
delay.   ARTICLE VI LIABILITIES    SECTION 6.1. Consequential and Other
Damages. No Party shall be liable, whether in contract, in tort (including
negligence and strict liability), or otherwise, for any special, indirect,
incidental or consequential damages whatsoever which in any way arise out of,
relate to, or are a consequence of, its performance or nonperformance
hereunder, or the provision of or failure to provide any Service hereunder,
including, but not limited to, loss of profits, business interruptions and
claims of customers.    -4-     SECTION 6.2. Limitation of Liability.
The liability of Seller with respect to this Agreement or in connection with
the performance, delivery or provision of any Service provided under by this
Agreement shall be limited to the Losses of Buyer arising from Seller\'s
willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence; provided that in no event shall
the liability exceed the fees previously paid to Seller by Buyer in respect
of the Service from which such liability flows.   SECTION 6.3. Indemnity.
Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller, its employees, agents, officers and
directors from any and all claims, demands, complaints, liabilities, losses,
damages and all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
(collectively, "Damages") resulting from a demand, claim, lawsuit, action or
proceeding relating to Seller\'s conduct in connection with the provision of
Services to Buyer under this Agreement, except to the extent such Damages
arise out of the willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence of Seller or any
of its employees, agents, officers and directors. Seller represents and
warrants that it has all necessary right and authority to provide the
Services to Buyer hereunder.   SECTION 6.4. Obligation to Correct. In the
event of any breach of this Agreement by Seller with respect to any error or
defect in the provision of any Service, Seller shall, at Buyer\'s request,
correct such error or defect or reperform such Service in a timely manner as
promptly as practical after Buyer\'s request at the expense of Seller.  
ARTICLE VII TERMINATION    SECTION 7.1. Termination. This Agreement shall
terminate on the earliest to occur of (a) the latest date on which any
Service is to be provided as indicated on Schedule A, (b) the date on which
the provision of all Services has terminated or been canceled pursuant to
Article IV and (c) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.2.   SECTION 7.2. Breach of Agreement. If either Party
shall cause or suffer to exist any material breach of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any failure to perform
any Services or to make payments when due, and said Party does not cure
such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof from
the nonbreaching Party, the nonbreaching Party may terminate this
Agreement, including the provision of Services pursuant hereto, immediately
by providing written notice of termination. The failure of a Party to
exercise its rights hereunder with respect to a breach by the other Party
shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights nor prevent such Party from
subsequently asserting such rights with regard to the same or similar
defaults.   SECTION 7.3. Sums Due. In the event of a termination of this
Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to all outstanding amounts due from Buyer
for the provision of Services rendered prior to the date of termination.  
SECTION 7.4. Effect of Termination. Article VI, Section 7.3, Article VIII and
this Section 7.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

outstanding, unless, in each such case, the transferee shall have executed
and delivered a counterpart to this Agreement agreeing to be bound by the

Restricted Securities Beneficially Owned by the Stockholder and the Parent

has failed to recommend against, (ii) which is approved by the holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Code (or any
successor provision) and as to which Parent and the Stockholder are in
compliance with the voting requirements set forth in Section 3.2 or (iii) in
which the Stockholder or Parent could be disadvantaged, in any material
respect, if the Stockholder or Parent failed to tender because the offer is a
partial tender offer for less than all of the outstanding Securities or a
tender offer for all Securities with no undertaking by the offeror or its
Affiliates for a second step or similar "back-end" transaction providing for
the same consideration as in the offer.   (d) Any attempted Transfer of any
Restricted Securities in violation of the provisions of this Section 3.3
