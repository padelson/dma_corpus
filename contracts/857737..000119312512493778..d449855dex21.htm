consideration or compensation with respect to each such Assigned Contract
("Royalties") (excluding any applicable VAT) earned by the Seller on or prior

Marketing Fees") on or prior to the Closing Date but not yet paid exceeded (or

Royalties with respect to each Assigned Contract shall have been or be earned
by Seller and Buyer, and the Seller Marketing Fees with respect to each
applicable Assigned Contract shall have been or be payable by Seller and
Buyer, _pro rata_ based on the percentage of the applicable royalty period for
each such Assigned Contract during which Seller or Buyer, as applicable, owned
the Assigned Contract. 

(c) If the Royalties earned by the Seller on or prior to the Closing Date but
not yet collected exceed the amount of the Royalties collected by the Seller
as of the Closing Date (excluding any applicable VAT), then with respect to

Seller out of Royalties actually collected by Buyer (provided that Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such amounts) by check or
wire transfer within the later of ten (10) days of the Final Reconciliation,
or if such Royalties have not yet been collected by Buyer, ten (10)
days after the date such Royalties are collected (if they are collected). If
the Royalties collected by the Seller as of the Closing Date for periods after

difference to Buyer by check or wire transfer within ten (10) days of the
Final Reconciliation. If the Seller Marketing Fees payable by Seller on or
prior to the Closing Date but not yet paid exceed the amount of Seller
Marketing Fees paid by the Seller as of the Closing Date (excluding any
applicable VAT), with respect to such Assigned Contract, Seller shall remit
the amount of the difference to Buyer by check or wire transfer within ten
(10) days of the Final Reconciliation. If the Seller Marketing Fees paid by

cause their respective Affiliates to report) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
including the allocation to be reasonably agreed upon by the Buyer and
Seller, and that neither of them (nor any of their respective Affiliates) will
take any position inconsistent therewith in any tax return, in any refund
claim, in any litigation or otherwise, unless otherwise required by
applicable law.

Section 2.8 _Third Party Consents_.

(a) To the extent that the consent of another Person is required by the terms
of any Assigned Contract or applicable law in order to assign the rights of
Seller under that Assigned Contract to Buyer (a "Required Consent"), Seller
shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain such Required Consent as promptly
as possible, at its own expense, and without agreeing to any change in the
terms of the applicable Assigned Contract without Buyers prior written
consent. Buyer shall cooperate with and use all reasonable efforts to assist
Seller in obtaining such Required Consents, but Buyer will not be required to
make any payments or agree to any change in the terms of any Assigned
Contract in connection with obtaining such Required Consent, provided that
consent to such a change shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed if a proposed change is not material. Seller shall be permitted to
seek a novation in lieu of an assignment with respect to the Assigned
Contracts (and Buyer agrees to sign a novation agreement in reasonable and
customary form if Seller is able to obtain consent to such novation from the
counterparty to the Assigned Contract), but agrees that it will not send any
notices or communications to any party to an Assigned Contract seeking a
novation or otherwise seeking their consent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby unless it is in substantially the same form
as Buyer has approved, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed so long as such notice does not suggest that such
consent is a Required Consent.

 

(b) Seller shall be responsible for obtaining such Required Consents, and
accordingly if a Required Consent is not obtained within the initial nine
month period following the Closing, and during such period, as a result, under
the terms of the Assigned Contract and applicable law, an Assigned Contract is
terminated, or Buyers rights with respect to such Assigned Contract
are impaired, or Buyer does not in effect obtain the benefit of such Assigned
Contract, notwithstanding Buyers performance of (or willingness to perform)
the obligations under such Assigned Contract, Buyer shall have a claim against
Seller and Parent under Section 9.1 for breach of their covenant hereunder in
the amount of the minimum guaranteed royalties under such Assigned Contract
for the duration of the remaining current term under such Assigned Contract,
plus Buyers reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with
pursuing such claim under Section 9.1.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing section (but without duplication of any
Losses), within the initial nine month period following the Closing, if any
other party to an Assigned Contract alleges that due to the failure to obtain
a Required Consent or novation, an Assigned Contract is terminated, an
assignment of an Assigned Contract (or an alternative arrangement described in
Section 2.8(d) below) was ineffective and that as a result the Assigned
Contract has thus been breached or is no longer in effect, or Buyers rights
with respect to such

 



12  Assigned Contract are impaired, or Buyer does not in effect obtain the
benefit of such Assigned Contract, notwithstanding Buyers performance of (or
willingness to perform) the obligations under such Assigned Contract, it
shall be treated as a third party claim that is subject to Section 9.2.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, if Seller is unable to assign an Assigned
Contract, Seller shall continue to be obligated to use all reasonable efforts
to obtain the necessary consent to assignment, and the assignment of such
Assigned Contract shall not take effect until such consent has been obtained,
and until such assignment (or a novation) has been effected, Seller shall hold
such Assigned Contract in trust for the Buyer, account for and pay or deliver
to the Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt any amounts paid
to Seller under such Assigned Contract, and otherwise act in accordance with
Buyers reasonable requests in accordance with such Assigned Contract, and
Buyer shall perform the obligations under such Assigned Contract, and the
parties will otherwise cooperate to establish a reasonable arrangement under
which Buyer shall obtain the benefits of such Assigned Contract and be
responsible for the obligations thereunder that would have been
Assumed Liabilities.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing if the party to any Assigned Contract with
respect to which a Required Consent has not been obtained accepts performance
from Buyer and fails to object within the initial nine months after the
Closing, Seller shall have no liability in connection with failure to obtain a
Required Consent with respect to such Assigned Contract. 

(f) For purposes of this Section 2.8, provided that Buyer offers reasonable
cooperation (at no out of pocket cost to Buyer) and performs its obligations
under the Transitional Services and License Agreement, from the Closing
through May 31, 2013, Seller shall be responsible if there is any failure of
the services provided under the Transitional Services and License Agreement
to meet the corresponding obligations under the Assigned Agreement, and
thereafter Buyer shall be responsible for any failure of such services to meet
such obligations.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, only the first $250,000
of any indemnity obligations of Seller and Parent pursuant to this Section
2.8 (in the aggregate) shall be subject to the Basket, and the cap on
liability set forth in Section 9.4(b) shall not apply.

(h) Seller or its Affiliates shall not seek any Required Consents or novations
any time after the initial nine month period following the Closing without the
prior written consent of Buyer.

earlier of (i) the Closing or (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII hereof, Seller, Parent and their Affiliates shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any director, officer, employee, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other agent or representative
solicit, initiate or encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries or the submission of
proposals or offers from any person relating to any acquisition or purchase
of all or any portion of the ownership interest in Seller or International
Subsidiary or of the Purchased Assets (other than in the ordinary course of
business) or the Business, and, other than with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other person to do or seek any of the
foregoing. Seller and Parent shall, and shall cause any of their
representatives or Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
or withdrawn any existing negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing (other than in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby). From the date hereof until the earlier of
(i) the Closing or (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII hereof, the Seller shall, within two (2) business days, notify Buyer if
any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person with
respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to Buyer, indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of
any proposal or offer.

 



23 Section 5.8 _Sponsorships_. At any time and from time to time prior to
Closing, Buyer shall have the right to inform Seller in writing that it
wishes to assume a sponsorship of an individual currently being sponsored by
Seller, International Subsidiary or its Affiliates in connection with the
Business, and in such case, subject to any required consents (which shall not
be subject to Section 2.8 hereof) the sponsorship of such individual shall
automatically be deemed to be included as an Assigned Contract. Seller agrees
that it shall not transfer the sponsorship agreement with any such
individuals to Parent until Closing.

Section 5.9 _Cooperation and Filings_. The Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

Section 5.10 _Assistance with Financial Statements_. Seller shall, at Buyers
expense, use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all commercially
reasonable actions, including the making available of the Sellers accountants
and the granting of access to Buyer and its accountants to all books and
records of the Seller used in connection with Sellers business and the
Purchased Assets, to assist Buyer in connection with Buyers preparation of
any financial statements which may be required by Items 2.01 and 9.01 of Form
8-K in order for Buyer to meet its Form 8-K obligations within the applicable
time period required by such form.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The parties have determined that they do not believe the Transfer
Regulations will apply as a result of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer will make offers of employment to those Target Employees it
wishes to hire on terms which are overall no less favorable than their terms
and conditions of employment immediately prior to the Closing Date, with such
offers to take effect on the Closing Date, or, where required in non-EU
jurisdictions to ensure continuity of service and avoid mandatory notice
and/or severance pay for Seller, Buyer will effect the transfer of Accepting
Employees by way of Employer Substitution. Seller shall procure that the Buyer
is afforded reasonable access to the Target Employees for the purposes of
making offers of employment. With effect from the Closing Date, Seller shall
release any Accepting Employee from any obligation to give notice of
termination of employment and from any post termination of employment
restrictions to the extent necessary to enable an Accepting Employee to take
up his or her employment with Buyer. If and to the extent that the Transfer
Regulations apply to transfer the contracts of employment of any Accepting
Employee(s) from Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or any Buyer Supplier, Buyer shall comply, and shall ensure
that such Buyer Supplier complies, in all respects with its obligations under
the Transfer Regulations, and the contracts of employment of the Accepting
Employees shall have effect on and from the Closing Date as if originally
made with Buyer or Buyer Supplier (as applicable).

 



24 (b) Without prejudice to the Buyers right to terminate the employment of any
Accepting Employee at any time, and excluding any benefits that would not
transfer under the Transfer Regulations, for at least one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide each Accepting Employee with
compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, that
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than their terms and conditions with
Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for at least one (1) year following the Closing
Date, each Accepting Employee who remains employed by Buyer or any Affiliate
shall be provided with a wage rate or base salary that is at least equal to
the wage rate or base salary of the Accepting Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law, (ii) any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement
with a works council or other employee representative group, (iii) any
employment agreement or (iv) any unilateral undertaking ("engagement
unilateral") or customary practices ("usages") would require Buyer to provide
to any Accepting Employee any more favorable terms of employment than those
otherwise provided for by this Section 5.11(b), then Buyer shall provide to
such Accepting Employee such more favorable terms;

(c) Without prejudice to Buyers right to terminate the employment of any
Accepting Employee at any time, for at least one year following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide to each Accepting Employee full credit (including
credit for any payments made by such Accepting Employee under any applicable
benefit plan of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates and waiver of any
limitations) for such Accepting Employees service with Seller or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility for and
calculation of benefits (including vacation, notice and severance benefits)
under any applicable law or benefit plan in which such Accepting Employee
participates following the Closing Date to the same extent recognized by
Seller or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing, provided,
however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. The Seller shall
indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and any Buyer Supplier and keep them
indemnified from and against all Losses arising in connection with or as a
result of:

 

(i) the employment by Seller or any Seller Affiliate of the Accepting
Employees (including, without limitation, any rights arising under or in
relation to their contracts of employment and any remuneration or benefit
accrued to the Accepting Employees) prior to the Closing Date;

(ii) any obligation of the Seller or any Seller Affiliate to inform and
consult with the Accepting Employees or their representatives under the
Transfer Regulations or other applicable law;

 

save in each case to the extent that such failure or Loss is caused by a
failure of Buyer, Buyer Affiliate or Buyer Supplier to comply with its
obligations under the Transfer Regulations or other applicable law; and

(iii) any claim made or brought against Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate or a
Buyer Supplier that an Accepting Employee is entitled to Transferred Benefits.

 



25 (d) In the event of the termination of the employment of any Accepting
Employee by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates prior to the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide the Accepting Employee with severance
pay and benefits calculated on the basis of the Accepting Employees combined
period of service with the Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and its
Affiliates and on terms no less favorable than the greater of the severance
pay and benefits to which the Accepting Employee (i) would have been entitled
under any applicable severance plan, policy, practice, or arrangement of
Seller or any local law or collective agreement applicable to such Accepting
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or (ii) is entitled to under
any applicable severance plan, policy, practice or arrangement of Buyer or
any local law or collective agreement applicable to such Accepting Employee on
the actual date of termination of the Accepting Employees employment
("Severance Pay"):

 

(i) In the event of the termination of the employment of any Accepting
Employee by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after Closing but on or prior to
May 31, 2013, Seller shall (without prejudice to Sellers obligation to pay
"Actual Expenses" under Section 6 of the Transitional Services and License
Agreement) indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and keep them indemnified for
all Severance Pay arising from such termination.

(ii) In the event of the termination of the employment of any Accepting
Employee by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after May 31, 2013 but on or prior
to the first anniversary of the Closing Date Seller shall (without prejudice
to Sellers obligation to pay "Actual Expenses" under Section 6 of the
Transitional Services and License Agreement) indemnify the Buyer and its
Affiliates and keep them indemnified for X % of all Severance Pay arising from
such termination. X shall be calculated on the basis of the following
formula:

A ÷ B = C

 

C x 100 = X

where A is the duration of the Accepting Employees total length of service in
complete weeks with Seller or any Seller Affiliate when such Accepting
Employee was not engaged wholly or mainly in the Business;

and B is the duration of the Accepting Employees total combined length of
service in complete weeks with Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and its
Affiliates.

Buyer shall and shall cause any Buyer Affiliate to use all reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Severance Pay due including but not limited to cooperation
with Seller and Sellers Affiliates and ensuring that as far as is reasonably
practicable any termination resulting in the payment of Severance
Pay complies with applicable Laws, a fair procedure is followed and selection
for dismissal is carried out in a non-discriminatory manner.

 



26 For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate
terminates the employment of any Accepting Employee after the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for all Severance
Pay and Seller gives no indemnity with respect thereto.

 

(e) If, as a consequence of this Agreement the contract of employment of any
Retained Employee is transferred to Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate or any Buyer
Supplier by the Transfer Regulations or otherwise by operation of law (or
liabilities in respect of any such persons employment are transferred to the
Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate or any Buyer Supplier) or it is alleged that
this is the case, Buyer (or Buyer Affiliate or Buyer Supplier, as
appropriate):

(i) shall notify Seller as soon as practicable after becoming aware of such
transfer or allegation (or Seller shall notify Buyer if Seller becomes aware);

(ii) shall cooperate with Seller (and Seller shall co-operate with such Buyer,
Buyer Supplier or Buyer Affiliate ) and encourage such Employee to accept any
offer of employment made by Seller;

 

(iii) may elect to challenge such contention that the Transfer Regulations
apply and/or terminate such contract of employment provided that Seller has
had an opportunity to offer employment to such Retained Employee and the
Retained Employee has had a reasonable opportunity to consider such offer and
(subject to any applicable Laws and subject to the Retained Employee in
question having alleged a transfer and the Buyer being aware of this) such
termination is no later than 90 days after the Closing Date;

(iv) shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses arising from such
termination including but not limited to cooperation with Seller and Sellers
Affiliates and ensuring that as far as is reasonably practicable such
termination complies with applicable Laws, a fair procedure is followed and
selection for dismissal is carried out in a non-discriminatory manner.

(f) Subject to and conditional upon Buyers (or Buyer Affiliates or Buyer
Suppliers) compliance in all material respects with Sections 5.11(e)(i) to
(iii) (with Buyer having a reasonable period to cure such non-compliance,
where capable of cure), Seller shall indemnify Buyer (for itself and on behalf
of its Affiliates and any Buyer Supplier) and keep Buyer indemnified from and
against all Losses which Buyer, any Buyer Affiliate or Buyer Supplier suffers
or incurs in connection with or as a result of the transfer of the contract of
employment of any Retained Employee to Buyer (or such Buyer Affiliate or Buyer
Supplier) as a consequence of this Agreement, howsoever and whenever arising
relating to:

(i) the contract of employment of any such Retained Employee or
its termination; and

 



27 (ii) any duty or liability of Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate or any
Buyer Supplier to any such Retained Employee or that Employees
representative(s), in relation to any matter whatsoever, including, without
limitation:

(1) salaries or wages, accrued holiday pay, expenses, benefits (including)
Employee Benefit Plans, or payments relating thereto;

 

(2) any claim for pay in lieu of notice, damages for wrongful, unfair or void
dismissal, redundancy pay or other severance payment to which the Retained
Employee is entitled and compensation for dismissal payable in accordance with
any applicable Laws (including any such claim arising from a dismissal or
constructive dismissal which is deemed to have been effected by Buyer or a
Buyer Affiliate or a Buyer Supplier as a result of the Transfer Regulations)
and any claim regarding the absence of a transfer or arising from any order to
reinstate or reemploy such Retained Employee;

 

(3) any claim arising from any failure to inform and consult with the Retained
Employee or the Retained Employees representatives in accordance with the
Transfer Regulations or otherwise;

(4) any liability in relation to the Retained Employee arising from acts and
omissions of Seller or any Seller Affiliate or any Seller subcontractor which
occur prior to the Closing Date which transfers to Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate
or a Buyer Supplier pursuant to the Transfer Regulations; and

(5) any claim made or brought against Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate or a Buyer
Supplier that such Retained Employee is entitled to Transferred Benefits.

If Buyer fails to use (or fails to cause any Buyer Affiliate or Buyer
Supplier to use) all reasonable efforts to mitigate in accordance with Section
5.11(e)(iv) the indemnity in this Section 5.11(f) shall not apply in respect
of any Losses which are incurred as a result of such failure. All
reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by the Buyer in using all reasonable
efforts to mitigate shall be reimbursed by Seller.

(g) The parties agree that any Losses incurred by a Buyer Supplier shall be
deemed to be Losses incurred by Buyer for the purposes of the indemnities in
Section 5.11 above and shall be recoverable by Buyer as such.

 



28 (h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer on any entity or
individual who is not a party to this Agreement (including any Employees) any
rights whatsoever. Further, nothing in this Agreement is intended to create
any obligation to pay any Severance Pay that an Accepting Employee is not
entitled to (for instance, if as a result of the underlying reason for the
termination of an Accepting Employee, no Severance Pay is owed).

(i) Buyer shall, and shall cause any Buyer Affiliate or Buyer Supplier to,
co-operate with Seller, and Seller shall and shall cause any Seller Affiliate
or Seller sub-contractor to co-operate in relation to providing such evidence
as the other may reasonably require to support a contention that the Transfer
Regulations are not applicable.

(j) Seller will discharge any liability to pay any retention or one-off
payment (together with all taxes, charges and other levies relating to such
payment) relating to or arising as a result of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that is or becomes due or payable to any
Accepting Employee or Subsequently Accepting Employee.

Section 5.12 _Transitional Services and License Agreement_. At the
Closing, Parent and the Buyer shall enter into a Transitional Services and
License Agreement in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Transitional
Services and License Agreement").

 

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_. Subject to the requirements of applicable law
and regulations, each party to this Agreement shall maintain in confidence
(a) the provisions of this Agreement and (b) all information received from
another party as a result of any due diligence investigation conducted
relative to the execution of this Agreement (collectively, the "Confidential
Information") and shall use such information only in connection with
evaluating the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that the Buyer may
use any such information related solely to the Purchased Assets or the
Business and not to any other business of Seller and its Affiliates as it
reasonably deems appropriate after the Closing; provided further that each
party may disclose any Confidential Information solely to the extent required
by applicable law in order to comply with any law applicable to such party
(including without limitation any laws relating to Taxes or disclosure or
financial reporting obligations), or in response to any summons, subpoena or
other legal process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to such
party in the course of any litigation, investigation or administrative
proceeding; provided, further, that, if any party to this Agreement becomes
legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Confidential Information, such party shall provide the
remaining parties with prompt prior written notice of such requirement and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, cooperate with the other parties to obtain
a protective order or similar remedy to cause the Confidential Information not
to be disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto, such
as objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the disclosing party
shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that has been
legally compelled, and shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed Confidential
Information. The obligation of confidentiality and non-use shall not apply to
any information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public
through no fault of the receiving party, (ii) is independently developed by
the receiving party or (iii) is received in good faith from a third party who
is lawfully in possession of such information and has the lawful right to
disclose or use it. In the event of the termination of

 



29  this Agreement, Buyer shall return to the Seller (or destroy and certify
such destruction to the Seller in writing) all documents and materials (and
reproductions thereof, electronic copies or otherwise) furnished to Buyer or
its Affiliates or representatives in connection with this Agreement for the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.14 _Legal Conditions to Transaction_. Seller, Parent and its
Affiliates and Buyer shall take commercially reasonable actions necessary to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which
actions shall include, without limitation, filing and furnishing all
information required under any antitrust or competition laws, if required),
and in connection therewith shall promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed
upon either of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller, Parent and its
Affiliates and Buyer shall (i) take commercially reasonable actions necessary
to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Authority or other third party, required to be obtained or made by the Seller,
Parent or its Affiliates for any of the conditions set forth in Article VI to
be satisfied (any of the foregoing, an "Approval") or the taking of any
action required in furtherance thereof or otherwise contemplated thereby or by
this Agreement, (ii) diligently oppose or pursue any rehearing, appeal or
other challenge which may be available to it of any refusal to issue any
Approval or of any order or ruling of any Governmental Authority which may
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or to take any action contemplated by any
Approval until such time as such refusal to issue any Approval or any order
or ruling has become final and non-appealable, and (iii) diligently oppose any
objections to, appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen any Approval
or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent and its Affiliates or Buyer and
its Affiliates shall be required to agree to waive any rights or to accept any
limitation on its operations or to dispose of any material assets
in connection with obtaining any such consent, authorization, order, Approval
or exemption.

Section 5.15 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and Parent will consult with each
other and will mutually agree (the agreement of each party not to be
unreasonably withheld) upon the content and timing of any press release or
other public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required
by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any securities exchange or any stock exchange regulations; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and Parent will give prior notice to the other party of
the content and timing of any such press release or other public
statement required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any securities exchange or any stock exchange
regulations.

Section 5.16 _Bulk Sales Compliance_. From and after the Closing Date, the
Seller and its Affiliates shall comply with all laws relating to bulk sales
related to the sale of the Purchased Assets. 

 



30 Section 5.17 _Non-Interference_. With respect to the national football clubs
of Canada, Peru, Norway and Ireland and with respect to the Colo Colo
football club in Chile (collectively, the "Designated Sponsored Parties"), to
the extent that such Designated Sponsored Parties are and remain parties to
exclusive sponsorship agreements with Seller or any licensees of Seller,
during the existing term and, except with respect to the Colo Colo football
club in Chile, the first renewal term of such agreements, after the Closing,
Parent will not interfere, and will prevent its Affiliates from interfering,
with such contractual relationship by soliciting the Designated Sponsored
Parties to terminate their agreement with Seller or the applicable Seller
licensee.

without further action by either of the parties hereto. If this Agreement
is terminated as provided herein, no party hereto shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party to this Agreement resulting from such
termination, except that such termination shall not relieve any party of
liability for any pre-termination breach or failure to perform in accordance
with the terms hereof, and the provisions of Sections 5.13, 5.15, 5.17,
8.1(b), 8.2 and 11.4 shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parent elects to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv) as a result of Buyers failure to
deliver the Purchase Price, then Buyer shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay
the Deposit, as well as any interest and any other income earned thereon, to
the Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Deposit is intended as security
and not as liquidated damages or a termination fee payable in lieu of the
remedy of specific performance as provided for by Section 11.19, and Parent
and Buyer agree that Parent shall have the right to retain the Deposit and
continue to seek specific performance of Buyers obligation to pay the
remainder of the Purchase Price and otherwise consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and/or seek damages for any breach hereof, provided that
the amount of the Deposit retained by Parent shall be credited towards the
Purchase Price or such damages.

amounts and the time limitations set forth in Section 9.4 and 11.7 hereto, and
subject to the provisions in Article 10 in respect of VAT, Parent, Seller and
International Subsidiary (each a "Seller Indemnifying Party") will jointly and
severally indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates, and its or their
respective permitted successors and assigns, together with its or their
respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (each a "Buyer Indemnified Party") harmless from and with
respect to any and all claims, lawsuits, liabilities, losses, damages, 

 



35  costs and expenses, including without limitation the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and all amounts reasonably paid in investigation,
defense or settlement of any of the foregoing (collectively, a "Loss" or
"Losses") arising out of any inaccuracies or misrepresentations in any
representation or warranty or breach of any covenant or agreement made by
Parent, Seller or International Subsidiary in this Agreement or in any other
Document delivered pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing Date, any of
the matters identified on Schedule 9.1 hereto and any Retained Liability; and
Buyer ("Buyer Indemnifying Party") will indemnify and hold Parent, Seller and
their Affiliates, and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
together with its or their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (each a "Seller Indemnified
Party") harmless from and with respect to any and all Losses arising out of
any inaccuracies or misrepresentations in any representation or warranty or
breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any
other Document delivered pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing Date,
any Assumed Liability, and any use by Buyer or its Affiliates of the
historical samples and kits described in Section 2.2(a).

 

Section 9.2 _Third Party Claims_. In the event that Indemnified Party desires
to make a claim against Indemnifying Party under Section 9.1 above in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding or demand at any time instituted
against or made upon Indemnified Party by any third party for which
Indemnified Party may seek indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"),
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Indemnifying Party of such Third Party
Claim and of Indemnified Partys claim of indemnification with respect
thereto. Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice to notify Indemnified Party in writing if it has elected to undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel of their own choosing (subject to the
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and at their sole risk and expense, the
good faith settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith; _provided_ : (a) all settlements require the prior reasonable
consultation with the Indemnified Party and the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and (b) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the
Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be borne by the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
contesting any such Third Party Claim in good faith, the indemnified party or
parties shall not pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim at any time,
provided that in such event they shall waive any right of indemnification
therefor by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not make a
timely election to undertake the good faith defense or settlement of the
Third Party Claim as aforesaid, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to proceed
with the good faith defense or settlement of the matter after making such
election, then, in either such event, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to contest, settle or compromise (provided that all settlements or
compromises require the prior reasonable consultation with the Indemnifying
Party and the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) the Third Party
Claim at their exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the
Indemnifying Party.

Section 9.3 _Assistance_. Regardless of which party is controlling the defense
of any Third Party Claim, each party shall act in good faith and shall provide
reasonable documents and cooperation to the party handling the defense.

 



36 Section 9.4 _Limitations of Liability_.

 

(a) Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify Indemnified Party
hereunder for any Loss arising under this Article IX, except to the extent
that (i) an individual Loss exceeds $100,000, and that (ii) the aggregate
amount of Losses for which Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX hereto exceeds an amount equal to $2,250,000 (the
"Basket") (it being understood and agreed that the Basket is intended as a
deductible, and accordingly the Indemnifying Party shall only be liable if and
to the extent that Losses exceed the Basket), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(a) shall not apply to
indemnification claims arising from (A) any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 3.1 ( _Organization and Qualification_ ), 3.2
( _Authorization_ ), 3.8 ( _Title_ ), 3.16 ( _Broker s Fees and
Commissions_), and 3.17 ( _Labor Matters_ ), (B) the indemnities given by the
Seller in Section 5.11 ( _Employee Matters_ ) (C) any covenants made by the
Seller herein, (D) the Retained Liabilities or (E) any acts of fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional and knowing breach of the Parent,
Seller or International Subsidiary, and _provided_   _further_ , that any
Losses from indemnification claims arising from any one or more breach(es) of
Section 3.7 ( _Contracts_ ) shall be payable only to the extent the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds $250,000 or the remaining amount of the Basket.

(b) The aggregate amounts payable by Indemnifying Party with respect to all
claims for indemnification shall not exceed $22,500,000, provided that the
limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(b) shall not apply to
indemnification claims arising from (A) any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 3.1 ( _Organization and Qualification_ ), 3.2
( _Authorization_ ), Section 3.7 ( _Contracts_ ), 3.8 ( _Title_ ), 3.16 (
_Broker s Fees and Commissions_), and 3.17 ( _Labor Matters_ ), (B) the
indemnities given by the Seller in Section 5.11 ( _Employee Matters_ ) (C)
any covenants of the Seller, (D) the Retained Liabilities or (E) any acts of
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional and knowing breach of the
Seller.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set forth herein, no party
hereto shall be liable for any punitive, special, consequential, incidental
or exemplary damages, other than any such damages that are actual Losses in
connection with a Third Party Claim. The amount of any and all Losses shall be
determined net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under insurance policies with respect to such Losses, in each case, net of
costs of collection and related premium increases thereunder, and (ii) any Tax
benefits (whether through a refund or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable)
actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to the facts or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the determination of whether an Indemnified Party
has realized a Tax benefit (and the determination of the amount of any such
Tax benefit) shall be made in the Indemnified Partys sole discretion
exercised in good faith, and an Indemnifying Party shall have no rights to
review the Tax Returns of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
9.4(c). If requested by the Indemnifying Party in writing, the Indemnified
Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party promptly following such
determination a certificate of the CFO or treasurer of the Indemnified Party
stating whether the Indemnified Party realized a Tax benefit and the amount of
any such Tax benefit.

 



37 Section 9.5 _Scope of Liability_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in the
absence of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or knowing and intentional
breach, its sole remedy against the Parent or Seller for any matter arising
out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is set forth in Section
9.1 hereto and that, except to the extent Buyer has asserted a claim for
indemnification prior to the applicable Liability Termination Date, Buyer
shall have no remedy against the Parent or Seller or any of their Affiliates
for any breach of any provision of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent
or Seller have any liability for Losses arising from the use of the Purchased
Assets after the Closing (other than such Losses attributable to a breach of
the representations and warranties of Parent hereunder or related to a
Retained Liability) and in no event shall Parent or Seller have any liability
to Buyer with respect to any matter arising out of or contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount in excess of the Purchase Price.

 

Section 9.6 _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal and applicable state income tax
purposes, and to the extent permitted by law in the United Kingdom and other
relevant jurisdictions, the parties shall report and treat any payments made
under this Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE X

VAT AND TAX MATTERS

 

10.1 For VAT purposes, the Seller warrants that neither it nor the
International Subsidiary are established or based outside the UK
or Singapore. All sums or other consideration payable by the Buyer to the
Seller pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement are exclusive of VAT
which if properly chargeable shall be payable by the Buyer in addition at the
appropriate rate. Seller will issue an invoice to Global Buyer in conformity
with art 226 Council Directive 2006/112/EC, subject to the Global Buyer
providing the Seller with all details required from the Global Buyer to do so
including the Global Buyers full name and address and VAT registration
number.

10.2 Based on the Global Buyers representations in Section 10.4, the sale of
UK IP is to be treated a supply of services supplied to the Buyer in The Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and as such outside the scope of UK VAT. If and to the
extent that VAT is chargeable or non-recoverable on the sale of the UK IP or
otherwise on any assets the Buyer shall, against delivery of a VAT invoice in
addition to any amount expressed in the Agreement to be payable by the Buyer,
pay to the Seller such VAT (including any penalties and interest, other than
penalties or interest arising solely from the failure of the Seller to
account promptly for VAT to any relevant Tax Authority following that Seller
having been placed in the appropriate amount of funds for that purpose by the
Buyer). In case Luxembourg VAT becomes non-recoverable arising from a failure
of the Seller to provide a valid VAT invoice having been provided with all
necessary information by the Global Buyer to do so, such non-recoverable VAT
amount (including any penalties and interest) will be paid by the Seller to
the Buyer provided that the Global Buyer will first provide the Seller with a
reasonable opportunity to remedy the Sellers alleged failure.

10.3 If any amount paid by the Buyer to the Seller in respect of UK VAT
pursuant to this Agreement is subsequently found to have been paid in error,
the Seller shall if the Seller has not yet accounted for such UK VAT to HM
Revenue and Customs promptly repay such amount to the Buyer, and if the Seller
has already so accounted then the Seller shall at the expense of the Buyer use
all reasonable efforts to obtain repayment thereof from HM Revenue and
Customs, and forthwith on receiving payment from HM Revenue and Customs shall
pay to the Buyer the amount repaid (including any interest).

 



38 10.4 The Global Buyer warrants to the Seller that it is a relevant business
person in The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and (without limitation to the
generality of the foregoing):

(a) the Global Buyer is a taxable person within the meaning of Article 9 of
the Council Directive 2006/112/EC;

(b) the Global Buyer is acquiring the UK IP for the purpose of a business to
be carried on in Luxembourg;

(c) the Global Buyer is registered for VAT purposes in Luxembourg or as a
result of the acquisition of the UK IP will become registered for VAT in
Luxembourg, effective from a date on or before the acquisition of the UK IP
and will operate the reverse charge in The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in
respect of the acquisition of UK IP for Luxembourg VAT purposes.

10.5 Each of the parties to this Agreement undertakes that they will
on request co-operate with the other party in connection with any VAT
liability under this Agreement.

10.6 The Buyer shall bear the cost of all Transfer Taxes arising on the
transfer of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement. The Buyer shall be
responsible for arranging the payment of all such Transfer Taxes, including
fulfilling any administrative or reporting obligation imposed by the
jurisdiction in question in connection with such payment.

ARTICLE XI

Section 11.2 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Any failure of Buyer, on the
one hand, or of Seller, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition contained herein may be waived in writing by
Seller or Buyer, respectively, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
other failure.

Section 11.3 _Validity_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Buyer shall be paid by Buyer, and all costs and expenses incurred

39 Section 11.5 _Further Assurances._

 

(a) From time to time after the Closing Date, without further consideration at
Buyers reasonable request upon reasonable notice and without material
disruption of Sellers business, Seller will promptly execute and deliver all
such further Documents or perform such acts as Buyer may reasonably request in
order to more fully consummate the transactions contemplated herein and in
order to more effectively vest, transfer, confirm, protect and defend the
right, title and interest of Buyer in the Purchased Assets and to assist Buyer

correspondence and other items relating to the Purchased Assets which are

or principally in connection with the Business previously acquired by Seller,
International Subsidiary, Parent and its Affiliates that is still owned by
Seller or its Affiliates and has not been cancelled, allowed to lapse or
expire, or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, such
party shall notify the other parties hereunder and, assuming such assets are
of the types described in Section 2.1(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) and are used
exclusively or principally in connection with the Business, shall cooperate
in good faith to transfer those assets to Buyer without any further
consideration and otherwise upon the terms hereof.

Section 11.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and,
except as provided below, inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto,
and except as set forth in Article IX hereof, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.7 _Survival of Representations and Warranties, etc._

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1 (
_Organization and Qualification_ ), 3.2 ( _Authorization_ ), 3.8 ( _Title_ ),
3.10 ( _Taxes_ ),3.16 ( _Broker s Fees and Commissions_), and 3.17 ( _Labor
Matters_ ) and the indemnities given by the Seller at Section 5.11 ( _Employee
Matters_ ) which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations , the representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall survive for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date (the
"Liability Termination Date"). 

 



40 (b) Save for the indemnities given by the Seller at Section 5.11 (
_Employee Matters_ ) which shall survive until the expiration of applicable
statute of limitations, Buyer agrees that on and after the Liability
Termination Date (i) each of Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates
shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever to any person, including
without limitation Buyer, for, and (ii) Buyer unconditionally releases each of
Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates from, any liability or
obligation of, or relating to, each of Parent, Seller or their respective
Affiliates of whatever kind or nature, whether contingent or absolute, whether
arising prior to, on or after, and whether determined or indeterminable on,
the Liability Termination Date, and whether or not specifically referred to
in this Agreement, including, without limitation, liabilities and obligations
(x) relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (y)
arising out of or due to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made by Parent or Seller or the breach of any covenant, undertaking or other
agreement of Parent or Seller contained in this Agreement and (z) relating to
any violation of any present or future Environmental Law (all of the
foregoing liabilities and obligations being collectively referred to herein as
the "Liabilities"), except pursuant to Sections 5.14 and 11.4 hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Article IX for which notice is given prior to the Liability Termination Date
shall survive until such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(c) This Section 11.7 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties
hereto which by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing Date.

Section 11.8 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall

agreement of the parties and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules
and exhibits attached hereto, the Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated June 27, 2012 between Buyer and Parent, embody the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject
matter contained herein or therein. There are no agreements, representations,

Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this Agreement, the
inclusion of any Contracts, liabilities, obligations or other matters in

other matters constitute Assumed Liabilities hereunder, except as expressly
set forth in Section 2.2 of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.15 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard

may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action
or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such courts
in any such suit, action or proceeding.

Parent make no representations or warranties to Buyer except as specifically
made in this Agreement. In particular, Seller and Parent make no
representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to (a) the information set

any financial projection or forecast relating to Seller or the Purchased
Assets. With respect to any such projection or forecast delivered by or on
behalf of Seller and Parent to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and forecasts,
(ii) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) it is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all such projections and forecasts so furnished to it and (iv) it shall have
no claim against the Seller or Parent with respect thereto. 

Section 11.18 _Interpretation_. If there is any discrepancy between this
Agreement and any Document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall govern.

Section 11.19 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby expressly recognize
and acknowledge that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result,
no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. It is
hereby agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief and other equitable relief,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy,
and the parties further hereby agree to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of a bond in connection with the obtaining of such injunctive or
other equitable relief. Such remedies, and any and all other remedies
provided for in this Agreement, shall, however, be cumulative in nature and
not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies whatsoever which
any party may otherwise have. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that
the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not
diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder
or any other injunctive relief. Each of the parties further acknowledges
and agrees that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause
an undue hardship to such party.

 



43 Section 11.20 _Iconix Guarantee_. Iconix hereby guarantees the prompt payment
and performance of all of Buyers obligations under the Agreement, if and
when due or required under, and subject in all respects to, the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, including, without limitation, any limitation of
liability that would otherwise be applicable to Buyer. Under no condition
