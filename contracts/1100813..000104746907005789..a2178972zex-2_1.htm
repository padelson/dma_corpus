to the conditions set forth in this Section&nbsp;2.4, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (the "<U>Top-Up
Option Shares</U>") that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1)&nbsp;share more
than the number of shares sufficient to reach the Short Form Threshold (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); provided that (i)&nbsp;the Top-Up Option shall not
be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares) and (ii)&nbsp;in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Company's total authorized and
unissued shares of Common Stock. Upon Parent's request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares in cash by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company. </FONT></P>

Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, and subject to satisfaction of the conditions
for exercise of the Top-Up Option set forth in Section&nbsp;2.4(a), Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part, after the
Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;the Effective Time and (ii)&nbsp;the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1. Neither Parent nor Purchaser may
transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Top-Up Option to any other Person, other than a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, without the prior written consent of the
Company. </FONT></P>
