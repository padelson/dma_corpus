 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger,_ " and together with the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_ ") has unanimously, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) recommended that the Company\'s stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement;

 WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to (i) make certain representations and warranties in connection with the Offer and the Merger, (ii) make certain covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE OFFER AND MERGER 

  

    
 Section 1.1 _ _ _The Offer_   

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) business days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated 

        
  

thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all
Shares at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price.

  

 (b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of Shares which, together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser (if any), represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote in the election of directors or (if a greater majority) upon the adoption of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly in accordance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act after Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable law. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller thereof in cash subject to any required withholding as provided in Section 2.2(e). 

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved by the Company in writing, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex I, (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) amend, modify or supplement any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I or the terms of the Offer in a manner that would broaden the scope of such conditions or that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the holders of Shares, or (vii) extend the expiration of the Offer in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) business days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

  

 (e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows: 

  

  

 (i) _ _ _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and all other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I) shall not have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to twenty (20) business days each, as determined by Purchaser, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer (A) if any condition to the Offer other than the Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied on or prior to January 20, 2008 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "), or 

  

      

  

(B) in the event that on the Initial Outside Date all of the conditions to
the Offer have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted
hereunder, other than the Governmental Approval Condition, if the
Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied on or prior to April
20, 2008 (the " _Extended Outside Date_ ");  _provided, further_ , Purchaser
shall not be obligated to extend the Offer beyond the Initial Outside Date
unless all of the conditions to the Offer, other than the Governmental
Approval Condition, have been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser if
permitted hereunder, or to extend the Offer beyond the Extended Outside Date,
as the case may be.

  

 (ii) _ _ _Required by Applicable Law or Nasdaq._ Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC (or its staff) or Nasdaq. 

  

  

 (f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up Option) to reach the Short Form Threshold, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of not more than twenty (20) business days immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f). 

   

 (g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1. 

  

 (h) As soon as practicable after the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_"), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and participate in the formulation of any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and all other 

        
  

applicable law. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository, acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

   

 (i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (j) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

    
 Section 1.2 _ _ _Company Actions_   

  

 (a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(c), contain the Company Recommendation. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Except in connection with a Company Change of Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the Company\'s receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and participate in the formulation of any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. 

   

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated promptly from time to time upon Purchaser\'s request, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to, and soliciting tenders of Shares by, the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and Parent shall (and shall cause their agents to) hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger (including solicitation of tenders into the 

        
  

Offer) and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver to
the Company all copies of such information and any extracts or summaries
thereof. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with
Parent and Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares
held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan or other Benefit Plans, and to
permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer.

  

    
 Section 1.3 _ _ _Directors_   

  

 (a) Following the acceptance for payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares (the " _Appointment Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to elect or designate a majority of the Company Board of Directors unless it is the beneficial owner of Shares entitling it to exercise at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Shares. The Company shall, upon Purchaser\'s request at any time following the Appointment Time, take all actions necessary, including but not limited to promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or using its reasonable efforts to promptly secure the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors to enable Purchaser\'s designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchaser\'s request following such time as Purchaser\'s designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors (the " _Control Time_ "), also cause Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Global Market (" _Nasdaq_ "). Promptly after the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. The Company\'s obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company in writing with, and shall be solely responsible for, all information with respect to Purchaser\'s designees to the Company Board of Directors and Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s respective officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (b) In the event that Purchaser\'s designees are elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board 

        
  

of Directors on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent
director" as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and
eligible to serve on the Company\'s audit committee under the Exchange Act
and Nasdaq rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and
the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided,
however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to
death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action
(including creating a committee of the Company Board of Directors) so that the
Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person
(or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no
Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three
(3) Persons to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following the election of Purchaser\'s
designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) until the Effective Time, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required (and, with
respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), shall constitute the authorization of
the Company Board of Directors and no further action on the part of the
Company Board shall be required) (i) for the Company to amend or terminate
this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the Company\'s rights,

by majority vote of the entire Company Board of Directors.

ARTICLE II 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

  

    Section 2.1 _ _ _Conversion of Capital Stock_   

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "): 

  

    
 (a) _ _ _Purchaser Common Stock_.  Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

    
 (b) _ _ _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.  All Shares that are owned by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

    
 (c) _ _ _Conversion of Common Stock_.  Each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

  

    
 (d) _ _ _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.  The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ _ _Surrender of Certificates_   

  

    
 (a) _ _ _Paying Agent_.  Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, funds with the Paying Agent as soon as and in the amounts necessary to enable the Paying Agent to make payments of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. 

  

    
 (b) _ _ _Procedures for Surrender_.  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as mutually agreed by the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and for each Book-Entry 

        

Share and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
without interest thereon. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Merger Consideration for Shares.

  

    
 (c) _ _ _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

    
 (d) _ _ _Termination of Fund; No Liability_.  At any time following one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent\'s routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

    
 (e) _ _ _Withholding Rights_.  Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration or Offer Price otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment, if any, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law, including with respect to stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

    
 (f) _ _ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving 

        

Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ _ _Dissenting Shares_   

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration for such Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give notice to Purchaser of any demands received by the Company from any stockholder of the Company in connection with the exercise of dissenter\'s rights by such stockholder, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand with respect to Dissenting Shares, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

    
 Section 2.4 _ _ _Top-Up Option_   

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.4, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1) share more than the number of shares sufficient to reach the Short Form Threshold (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); provided that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) and (ii) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Company\'s total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock. Upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares in cash by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company. 

  

 (b) Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or other legal impediment shall prohibit or require stockholder approval for the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, and subject to satisfaction of the conditions for exercise of the Top-Up Option set forth in Section 2.4(a), Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part, after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. Neither Parent nor Purchaser may transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Top-Up Option to any other Person, other than a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, without the prior written consent of the Company. 

  

 (c) Each time that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice,_ " the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing 

        
  

the Top-Up Option Shares which Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up
Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt
of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Purchaser
confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase
price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up
Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares as specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt in
cash by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, and the
Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or
certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the Company does
not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares.
Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are
required by federal or state securities laws.

  

 (d) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares which Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ _ _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and other Equity Awards_   

  

 (a) " _Cancelled Company Option_ " shall mean each option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (" _Company Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is held by a person who is not an employee or a service provider of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent immediately after the Effective Time as reasonably determined by Parent in its sole discretion, (ii) is vested and exercisable (after taking into account the effect of the accelerated vesting contained in clause (iv) or (v) of this Section 2.5 or any contract or arrangement providing for the accelerated vesting of outstanding options on or prior to the Effective Time) immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any Company Options that vest at the Effective Time, (iii) has an exercise price, immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, (iv) is subject to the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and/or held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and which Parent reasonably determines may not be converted into an Assumed Company Option (as defined in the paragraph below), (A) under the applicable laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable commercial efforts) or (B) under the generally applicable policies and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of equity awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , any such Company Options that are not assumed by Parent under this clause (iv) shall be accelerated in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (v) is held by a non-employee member of the Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Company Options that are not assumed by Parent under this clause (v) shall be accelerated in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the holders of Cancelled Company Options, each Cancelled Company Option shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Cancelled Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of such Cancelled Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of 

         

Cancelled Company Options the Option Consideration as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time and in any event within fifteen business days
thereof.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Cancelled Company Option (an " _Assumed Company Option_ ") shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") in accordance with this Section 2.5. At the Effective Time, each Assumed Company Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plans under which such Assumed Company Option was granted and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to vesting, except that: (i) such Assumed Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price of each such Assumed Company Option shall be adjusted by dividing (A) the per share exercise price of each such Assumed Company Option by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent. The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to the quotient of (1) the Offer Price, divided by (2) the average of the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of Parent Common Stock during the five (5) trading days ending on the date that is two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date. The parties acknowledge that, with respect to any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options" or "ISOs"), the foregoing provisions are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, (i) each unvested Share subject to restrictions and forfeiture granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ ") that is held by persons holding less than five hundred (500) shares of Restricted Stock shall be vested and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) the Merger Consideration payable with respect to all unvested shares of Restricted Stock held by person (a " _Restricted Person_ ") holding more five hundred (500) or more shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such unvested Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Therefore, cash otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for the Restricted Stock held by Restricted Persons and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not automatically be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that such shares of Restricted Stock would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and the agreement evidencing the original purchase of such Restricted Stock). Parent shall make all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash as soon as administratively practicable after the day on which such Unvested Cash would have become vested under the original vesting schedule and in any event by the last day of the month in which such Unvested Cash becomes vested. All outstanding rights to repurchase Restricted Stock that the Company may hold or similar restrictions in the Company\'s favor immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Restricted Stock (all such rights, the " _Repurchase Rights_ ") shall be assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by Parent retaining the Unvested Cash into which such Restricted Stock has been converted, and paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in effect for each such share subject to that Repurchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Assumed Company Options assumed in 

        
  

accordance with this Section 2.5. Within fifteen (15) business days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of any Assumed Company Options for which a Form S-8 registration
statement is available to be registered with the SEC on Form S-8 and shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably
cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration
statement.

  

 (e) Within fifteen (15) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Options and Restricted Stock appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and describing the adjustments required by this Section 2.5. 

  

    
 Section 2.6 _ _ _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_   

  

 On the earlier of (a) the date the Appointment Time occurs and (b) August 31, 2007 (the " _New Exercise Date_ "), each outstanding purchase right (each, a " _Purchase Right_ ") under the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") automatically shall be exercised as of the New Exercise Date and each ESPP participant\'s accumulated payroll contributions as of such date that are not withdrawn as of the New Exercise Date shall be applied toward the purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. All Offering Periods (as defined in the ESPP) shall end on the New Exercise Date and the ESPP shall terminate as of the New Exercise Date. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the New Exercise Date, following the application of accumulated payroll contributions toward the purchase of Shares in accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent shall cause the Company to return to participants any of their respective accumulated payroll contributions not applied to the purchase of Shares under the ESPP, if any. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not permit (i) any new Offering Period to commence or (ii) any current participant in the ESPP to increase the rate of his or her payroll deductions into his or her account under the ESPP. 

  

    
 Section 2.7 _ _ _Additional Benefits Matters_   

  

 The Company shall take all necessary actions to effect the transactions described in Sections 2.5(a), (b) and (c) and Section 2.6 above pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the Company Options and Restricted Stock and the ESPP. All amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and (c) shall be paid without interest, and no Unvested Cash or rights to receive any payments pursuant to Section 2.5(a) or (c) may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash or payment pursuant to Section 2.5(a) or (c) in accordance with this Agreement.

All contributions to each Foreign Plan required to be made by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries through the Closing Date have been or shall be made or, if applicable, shall be accrued in accordance with country-specific accounting practices. No litigation has been commenced with respect to any Foreign Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such litigation is threatened (other than routine claims for benefits in the normal course).

provided to retirees and other former employees) without material liability
(other than benefits then payable under such plan without regard to such
amendment or termination) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary at any
time. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries complies in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the
Code or any similar state statute with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a
group health plan within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such
state statute. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
material obligations for retiree health or life insurance benefits under any
Benefit Plan (other than for continuation coverage under Section 4980B(f) of
the Code).

  

 (h) Except as may be required by applicable law, or as contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any plan or commitment to create any additional Benefit Plans or Foreign Plans, or to amend or modify any existing Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan in such a manner as to materially increase the cost of such Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 (i) Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses: (i) each material payment (including any bonus, severance, unemployment compensation, deferred compensation, forgiveness of indebtedness or golden parachute payment) becoming due to any current employee under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan because of this Agreement (or the consummation of the Transactions); (ii) any increase in any material respect of any benefit otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; (iii) any acceleration in any material respect of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; or (iv) any material obligation to fund any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits under a Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan in each case caused or triggered by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions contemplated hereby.

 When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. All references to this Agreement shall be deemed to include references to the "plan of merger" contained herein (as such term is used in the DGCL). The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

    
 Section 9.8 _ _ _Counterparts_   

  

 This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 

  

    
 Section 9.9 _ _ _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_   

  

 This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement: 

   

 (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and 

  

 (b) except as provided in Section 6.5, are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

    
 Section 9.10 _ _ _Severability_   

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

        
  

    
 Section 9.11 _ _ _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_   

   

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the law of any other state. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 

  

    
 Section 9.12 _ _ _Waiver of Jury Trial_   

  

 EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE OFFER AND MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12. 

   

    
 Section 9.13 _ _ _Assignment_   

  

 This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or (iii) to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

        
  

    
 Section 9.14 _ _ _Enforcement; Remedies_   

  

 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

ANNEX I 

  

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Purchaser\'s rights and obligations to extend or amend the Offer in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligations of Purchaser to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered Shares if, at or prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended pursuant to the Merger Agreement) (i) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii) any statutory waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or otherwise been terminated or any approvals required under the antitrust, competition or merger control laws of China and Germany applicable to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer (collectively, the " _Required Governmental Approvals_ ") shall not have been obtained, in each case, free of any condition or requirement imposing any Divestiture (collectively, the " _Governmental Approval Condition_ ") or (iii) any of the following conditions exist or has occurred and is continuing: 

  

 (a) any injunction shall have been issued and be in effect, by any United States federal or state court or foreign Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction which prohibits, restrains or enjoins the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and which shall have become final and non-appealable; 

   

 (b) any suit, action or proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending by any United States federal or state or foreign Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling would (1) prohibit, restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (2) result in any Divestiture; 

  

 (c) (i) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Article III of the Merger Agreement (other than those in Section 3.2(a), Section 3.3 and Section 3.4(a)) shall have been inaccurate as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which shall speak only as of such date) and the inaccuracies in such representations and warranties shall not have been cured and would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for all purposes of determine the accuracy of such representations and warranties, all references to the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on the word "material," except for the reference to the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" in Section 3.8(b)(i), shall be disregarded); (ii) any representation or warranty in Section 3.2(a) shall have been inaccurate in any material respect as of the specified date on which they were made, and such inaccuracy shall not have been cured, which representation and warranty shall be deemed to be materially inaccurate if the Company\'s actual fully diluted capitalization as of such date exceeds by more than 500,000 shares the amount of the Company\'s fully diluted capitalization reflected in Section 3.2(a) (as may be qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule); or (iii) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 3.3 or Section 3.4(a) shall have been inaccurate in any material respect as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which shall speak only as of such date) and the inaccuracy in such representation or warranty shall not have been cured in all material respects; 

  

 (d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred and shall continue to exist; 

   

 (e) the Company shall have breached in any material respect, or failed in any material respect to perform or to comply with, any material covenant to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach or failure shall not have been cured in all material respects; or 

        
  

 (f) the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement, other than the Minimum Condition which may be waived by Parent or Purchaser only with the prior written consent of the Company. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in this Annex I or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 The other capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which this Annex I is annexed.
