violation of the WARN Act occurring after the Closing Date with respect to
the Business.   (c) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,

Assumed Contracts at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing to approve the
Transaction and that non-Seller parties that do not object to the Cure Notice
will be bound by the Cure Notice notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Assumed Contracts or any other document, and that the non-Seller party
will be forever barred from asserting any other claims against the Buyer or
the Acquired Assets as to such Assumed Contract, and (viii) if a Qualified
Bid is submitted and there shall be an auction at which Buyer shall become
the successful bidder, than the Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing

become the successful highest bidder, provided, however, Sellers shall credit
Buyer the Topping Fee against the ultimate Purchase Price payable by
Buyer.   (d) Sellers shall promptly make any filings, take all actions
and use reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all other approvals and
orders necessary or appropriate for consummation of the Transactions, subject

than Buyer, Sellers shall pay a topping fee of Two Million Thirteen Thousand
Four Hundred Fifty Dollars ($2,013,450.00) (the "TOPPING FEE") to Buyer by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer, upon the consummation of such sale payable from the proceeds of the
closing of the sale of the Acquired Assets or any portion thereof (except for
any immaterial portion thereof) before any other expenses or claims are paid
regardless of priority. If a Qualified Bid is submitted and there shall be an
auction at which Buyer shall become the successful bidder, Sellers shall
credit Buyer the Topping Fee against the ultimate Purchase Price payable by
Buyer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Topping
Fee will not be payable and this Section 8.1 will not become operative until
the Buyer delivers the Financing Commitment to the Sellers.   (b) EXPENSE
REIMBURSEMENT. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.2(c), (e), (f), (g), (h)(A) or (h)(B), Sellers shall pay the
Expense Reimbursement to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Buyer, upon the first day after the
termination of the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the Expense Reimbursement shall not be payable and this Section
8.1(b) will not become operative until the Buyer delivers a Financing
Commitment to the Sellers.   31      (c) SUPERPRIORITY. In addition to
the protections given above, the amounts provided for in this Section 8.01
shall have superpriority administrative expense claim status in the Case
pursuant to Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, senior to all other
superpriority administrative expense claims.   SECTION 8.2. FIDUCIARY DUTY
OF SELLERS. Except as may be limited by Section 8.4, nothing contained herein
shall limit Sellers from performing their fiduciary duties to maximize the
value of Sellers\' Estate, including the right of Sellers directly or
indirectly to solicit or to encourage any proposals or offers from any Person
relating to the acquisition of the Business, to assist any third party in
preparing or soliciting an offer relating to such an acquisition, or to
accept such an offer subject to the obligations of Sellers under this Article
VIII.   SECTION 8.3. SALE HEARING. Within three days after execution of
this Agreement by all parties, Sellers shall file with the Court a motion
to approve this Agreement and the Transactions pursuant to Section 363 and
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and shall request an immediate hearing relative
to entry of the Interim Order. In addition to approving the Buyer
Protection Provisions, the Interim Order shall establish a timetable and
mechanism for the submission of competing bids by other prospective
purchasers of the Acquired Assets.   SECTION 8.4. NON-SOLICITATION. (a)
Subsequent to the entry of the Interim Order and except as expressly set
forth herein or required by the Court, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, Sellers will not, seek or solicit from any third person (a "THIRD
PERSON") any inquiries or proposals relating to any agreement, or propose or
enter into any agreement with any Third Person, other than a confidentiality
agreement (on terms not materially more favorable than those, if any,
afforded to Buyer) concerning the sale of all or any of the Acquired Assets
or any other transaction otherwise inconsistent with this Agreement in any
material respect (collectively, a "COMPETITIVE TRANSACTION"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or elsewhere shall prevent
Sellers (consistent with the fiduciary duties of Sellers to obtain the
highest and best offer for the Acquired Assets), from (a) cooperating with or
responding to unsolicited inquiries from, or negotiating with, any Third
Person who expresses, or has expressed, prior to the date hereof, interest in
a Competitive Transaction, including granting to such Third Person access to
the books, records and documents pertaining to the Sellers and Sellers\'
assets which are the subject of the Transactions; (b) responding to
unsolicited inquiries submitted by Third Persons, subject, however, to the
provisions of this Section 8.4; (c) providing notice of the Transactions to
all creditors and parties in interest and any and all Third Persons who have
heretofore expressed an interest in a Competitive Transaction; and (d)
cooperating, negotiating or entering into an agreement with any Third Person
that expresses or has expressed an interest in a Competitive Transaction on
terms more favorable to the Sellers, as determined by the boards of directors
of the Sellers, than those contained in this Agreement.   (b) LIMITATIONS
ON NON-SOLICITATION. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary the Non-Solicitation provision set forth in Section 8.4(a):   (i)
will not become operative until the Buyer delivers a  Financing Commitment to
the Sellers; and   (ii) will terminate and be of no force and effect after 
September 30, 2000.   32      ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION

and among the Buyer, American Pad and Paper Company, American Pad and Paper
Company of Delaware, Inc., APandP; Manufacturing, Inc., WR Acquisition, Inc.
and American Pad and Paper Sales Company, Inc. (collectively, the "Sellers").
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Buyer will, under certain circumstances,

(the "Guarantor"), an affiliate of Buyer, hereby unconditionally and
absolutely undertakes, guarantees and agrees to cause Buyer to perform

The Guarantor is a corporation  duly organized and validly existing and in

Guarantor in  accordance with its terms.   (b) CONFLICTING INSTRUMENTS;
CONSENTS. The execution and  delivery by the Guarantor of this Guaranty do
not, and the consummation  of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate any provision  of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws (or the
equivalent  thereof) of the Guarantor, or conflict with or result in a breach
of,  or create an event of default (or event that, with the giving of
notice  or lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of default)
under,  any agreement, mortgage, license, lease, indenture, instrument,
order,  arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the Guarantor is a 
party.   (c) LITIGATION. There is no action, suit, claim, proceeding, 
inquiry or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor,

construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to the choice of law rules thereof.   6. This
Guaranty is and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   7. All

limitation, any dispute relating to the interpretation, meaning or effect of
any provision hereof will be resolved in the Court (as defined in the

of the Court for the purpose of adjudicating any such dispute.   IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the undersigned Guarantor has executed this Guaranty as of the date
first written above.   GUARANTOR   SUPER AMERICAN TISSUE INC.    By: 
----------------------------------  Name:  Title:   45      EXHIBIT
E    FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL  Ladies and Gentlemen:   We have acted
as counsel for American Pad and Paper Company, American Pad and Paper Company of
Delaware, Inc., American Pad and Paper Sales Company, Inc. and WR Acquisition,
Inc., each, a Delaware corporation, and APandP; Manufacturing, Inc., a
Wisconsin corporation, in connection with the Acquisition pursuant to the
Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of August __, 2000 among Sellers and Buyer
(the "Purchase Agreement") and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein without
definitions will have the respective definitions ascribed to such capitalized
terms in the Purchase Agreement. We are rendering this opinion to you
pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) of the Purchase Agreement.   In connection
with this opinion, we have examined the following documents as executed at or
prior to the Closing:   the Purchase Agreement; and   the bills of sale
and assignment documents relating to the items of personal property included
in the Acquired Assets to be assigned and transferred to Buyer or its
designees at the Closing pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.   In addition
to the foregoing, we have examined the original or certified, conformed or
photostatic copies of such other instruments, documents and agreements and
such corporate and public records as we have deemed necessary or relevant for
the purpose of issuing the opinion hereinafter expressed. In our examination
of the foregoing instruments, documents, agreements and records, we have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of
documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. As
to any facts material to this opinion, we have, to the extent that such facts
were not independently established by us, relied upon certificates of
officers and employees of Sellers.   We understand that with respect to
Real Property title matters you will be relying on the title insurance
commitments issued to you. We have not made any investigation of, and do not
express an opinion as to, any matters of title to or the descriptions of any
Real Property or priority of liens.   We express no opinion with respect to
the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction, other than the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the law of the States of California and New York and the
federal law of the United States. While we are not admitted to practice in
the State of Delaware we are generally familiar with the Delaware General
Corporation Law as presently in effect and have made such inquiries as we
consider necessary to render the opinions contained herein.   46     
Each opinion set forth below relating to the enforceability of any agreement
or instrument against each of the Sellers is subject to the following
qualifications:   (a) as to any agreement or instrument delivered by any of
Sellers, we assume that such Seller has received the agreed-to consideration
therefor; and   (b) as to any agreement or instrument to which any of
Sellers is a party, we assume that such agreement or instrument is the
binding obligation of each other party thereto.   Based upon, and subject
to, the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are
of the opinion that:   1 Except for APandP; Manufacturing, Inc. for which we
render no opinion, each of Sellers is a duly organized corporation and is
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with
full power to carry on its respective part of the Business as it is now
conducted and to own, lease, license or operate the Acquired Assets.   2.
Except for APandP; Manufacturing, Inc. for which we render no opinion, each of
Sellers has all requisite power and authority to enter into the Purchase
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to
consummate the Transactions. The Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to be executed by Sellers in connection with the Purchase Agreement
have been, or upon execution, will have been, duly executed and delivered by
Sellers, have been effectively authorized by all necessary corporate action
of Sellers, and constitute, or upon execution, will constitute, legal, valid
and binding obligations of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance
with their respective terms.   3. The bills of sale and other assignment
documents executed by Sellers at the Closing which purport to assign and
transfer to Buyer and its designees all right, title and interest of Sellers
in the items of personal property included in the Acquired Assets, are in
proper form to effect such assignment and transfer to Buyer and its
designees.   4. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Sellers
of the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which such Seller
is a party, and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, will not, as of the Closing Date, (i) require any consent,
approval, authorization or other order of, or qualification with, any
Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or filings and
recordings with certain Government Authorities to register or record certain
of the Transaction Documents, (ii) conflict with, or constitute a breach of
any of the provisions of, or a default under, the charter, by-laws or
other organizational document of any of the Sellers (except for APandP;
Manufacturing, Inc. for which we render no opinion), or (iii) violate any
material law applicable to Sellers or the Acquired Assets (excepting all
local laws and ordinances).   Our opinion that any document is valid,
binding or enforceable in accordance with its terms is qualified as to (a)
limitations imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally, (b) rights to indemnification and contribution
which may be limited by applicable law and equitable principles, and (c)
general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible  
47     unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law.   The opinion expressed herein is rendered solely for your
benefit and use and the benefit of Deutsche Bank Securities Corporation. This
opinion may not be relied upon by any other person without our prior written
consent. Except as hereinabove expressly set forth, no opinion is made, and
none shall be implied. We disclaim any obligation to update this opinion
letter for events occurring or coming to our attention after the date
hereof.    Very truly yours,   Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP   [The
