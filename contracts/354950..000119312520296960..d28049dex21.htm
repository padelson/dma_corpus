15, 2020, among The Home Depot, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Coronado Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and HD Supply Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement and not defined where first used have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in _Annex A_.

 

RECITALS

 

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in their
respective best interests for Parent to acquire the Company on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by
Parent, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the shares of Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding (" _Shares_ ") at a price per share of $56.00 (such amount, the "
_Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

C. Following the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer
and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_
") and each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will
be canceled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price;

D. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board_ ") has (i)
determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and are fair to the
stockholders of the Company (the " _Stockholders_ ") and in the best interests
of the Company and (ii) approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, declaring their
advisability and, subject to the terms hereof, recommending that the
Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Merger Sub in the
Offer; and

E. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, in consideration of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, agree
as follows:

 

I. THE OFFER

 

1.1 _The Offer_. (a) On a date to be agreed by Parent and the Company or,
if they are unable to agree, on or prior to the 20th Business Day after the
date of this Agreement (the " _Commencement Date_ "), Merger Sub will (and
Parent will cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

 

(b) The obligation and right of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay
for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer will be solely subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer
(and not validly withdrawn) prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that
number of Shares which 

   

 represents a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully
diluted basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative
securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting
schedule or other terms and conditions thereof)) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ")
and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent
permitted hereby) of the other conditions and requirements set forth in
_Annex B_ (together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").
Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of the other Offer Conditions,
Merger Sub will (and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in
accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly
as practicable after the Expiration Time. The conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex B_ are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time, subject to this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer will be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(i)_.

(c) The Offer will be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that includes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set
forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub
reserve the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Condition), to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in
writing by the Company (in its sole discretion), Merger Sub will not (i)
reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price,
(iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the
conditions set forth in _Annex B_ or modify or change any Offer Condition in a
manner adverse to any Stockholders, (v) except as otherwise provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1_, extend or otherwise change the expiration time of the
Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, or (vii)
otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a
manner adverse to any Stockholder.

 

(d) The Offer will expire at midnight (New York City, New York time) on the
date that is 20 Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration
Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been extended as
permitted or required by this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer
has been so extended or re-extended (the Initial Expiration Time, as so
extended, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

 

(e) (i) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time, any of the
Offer Conditions has not been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or Merger Sub, then
Merger Sub may (and in such case Parent will cause Merger Sub to) extend the
Offer for successive periods of up to ten Business Days each (or such
additional or longer periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days each if Parent
so desires and the Company consents in writing prior to such extension), the
length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion
in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; and (ii) Merger Sub
will (and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for any period or
periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of the Securities and Exchange
Commission or its staff (the " _SEC_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in any
case in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_, Merger Sub will not be required
to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date and will not be permitted to
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the Companys consent in its
sole discretion.

 

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger
Sub will, and Parent will cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(i)_) all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 12 hours after the Expiration Time.
Acceptance for payment of Shares in accordance with this Agreement upon the
Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ,"
and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_."

(g) Merger Sub will not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Time, except after this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by

 



-2- 

    

 Merger Sub prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered in the
Offer, Merger Sub will promptly return, and will cause any depository acting
on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub will file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO will include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if
any (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which
the Offer will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company will promptly furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange
Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub will take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, will correct promptly any material information provided by
it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
becomes false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub will take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub will promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and will promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand. Prior to filing any Offer Documents (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the
Stockholders, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub will provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents
or response, and Parent and Merger Sub will give reasonable consideration to
any such comments.

 

(i) Parent will provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, within two
Business Days after the Expiration Time, the funds necessary to pay for any
Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for,
pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_. (a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company will file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule  14D-9_") that
will, subject to the terms hereof, including the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.2_, contain the Company Recommendation and will reflect that the Merger will
be consummated as soon as practicable following the completion of the Offer
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL (which, subject to the satisfaction or
permitted waiver of each of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, will
be immediately following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer). The Company will take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be prepared and filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Stockholders,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and
Merger Sub will promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, will correct promptly any material information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
becomes false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by applicable Law. The Company will take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company will promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and will promptly provide
Parent and Merger Sub copies of all correspondence between the Company and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Except
in connection with a disclosure regarding a Change of Recommendation or an
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC
or

 



-3- 

    

 dissemination thereof to the Stockholders, or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company will provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company will give
reasonable consideration to any such comments. Subject to the terms hereof,
including the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the Company hereby consents
to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation
contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish or
cause to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub or their agents mailing
labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and
any other available listings or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders or beneficial owners of Shares as of a recent
date, and will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including updated lists of record holders or beneficial owners of
Shares, from time to time upon Parents, Merger Subs or either of their
respective agents request, and the addresses, mailing labels and lists of
security positions of such record holders or beneficial owners) as Parent,
Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer and the Offer Documents to the record holders and
beneficial owners of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub will hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and will use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement will
be terminated, will promptly deliver (and will cause their agents and
Representatives to deliver) to the Company or will destroy all copies and any
extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or control.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby joins and agrees to be bound as the "
_Receiving Party_ " under the Confidentiality Agreement as fully as if
originally party thereto. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the
Company will cause its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub
to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to
any Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender such
Shares in the Offer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
applicable Company Benefit Plan.

the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature

of those conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), or at such other place, date
and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing.

2.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing,
the parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of

 



-4- 

    

 the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate
of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties hereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ") and will make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.

 

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, after the Effective Time,
all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties
of each of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation. At and
after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties and assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Merger Sub.

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as _Annex C_ , and bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ and applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and any Contracts between a director
or officer of the Company and the Company in effect as of immediately prior to
the date hereof will govern the rights of all directors and officers of the
Company in respect of claims for indemnification based in whole or in part on
actions or failures to take action prior to the Closing, and neither the
amendments thereto contemplated hereby or following the Closing will affect
the rights and obligations thereunder relating to such actions or failures
to take action.

2.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office until his or her respective successor is duly elected or
appointed and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal,
in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation
and bylaws and the DGCL.

 

III. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) (i) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but excluding shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(ii)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price in cash per Share (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest, upon surrender of such Shares in the
manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_, less any required withholding
taxes. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares will cease to be outstanding,
will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ", it being understood that any references herein to a "
_Certificate_ " or " _Certificates_ " will be deemed to include references,
as applicable, to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
Shares where appropriate) formerly representing any of the Shares will
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
each such Share, without interest.

(ii) Each Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as
treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will
cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Each share, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into
and become, in the aggregate, 1,000 validly issued, fully paid and

 



-5- 

    

 nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and will constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub will be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company occurs as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution is
declared with a record date during such period, the Offer Price and Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
including  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares cancelled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(ii)_) and held by a record holder or beneficial owner
who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who is statutorily entitled to exercise appraisal rights and
who duly complies with all provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL concerning
the right of holders of Shares to dissent from the Merger and seek appraisal
of their Shares (such Shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders dissenters rights under the DGCL with respect
to such Shares) will not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead will be entitled to only such rights as are granted
by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares will be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_, without
interest thereon and less any required withholding taxes, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such Shares in the manner provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned prior to
the Effective Time, then the right of any Stockholder to be paid the fair
value of such Stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will be null and void. The Company will provide Parent prompt written
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent will have the opportunity
and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or to the extent
required by Law, the Company will not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or agree to settle, any such demands.

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will appoint a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement customary in form
and substance, for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for the
Certificates.

 

(b) Prior to or concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or
will cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement (such cash, and any
additional cash deposited pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(h)_, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(c) Promptly, and in any event within two Business Days after the Effective
Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in such exchange (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). The
Letter of Transmittal will be in a form mutually agreed upon by Parent, the
Company and the Exchange Agent, and will specify that the delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent.

 



-6- 

    

(d) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message"
by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer,
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a
Certificate. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate will represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it will be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer or,
if uncertificated, is properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting
such payment will pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer, documentary, stamp
or similar taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they will be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Shares 180 days after the Effective Time will be returned to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ prior to that
time will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be liable to any holder of
Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(h) The Exchange Agent will invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any investment of such
cash will in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $25 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid to Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund is
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation, promptly to deposit additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund will not be used
for any purpose not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(i) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective agents will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer or
under this Agreement to any holder of Shares, and any amounts payable as
described under  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ")
or any provision of applicable Federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Units, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

(j) In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving

 



-7- 

    

 Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Merger Consideration.

 

3.3 _Company Stock Awards and Company ESPP_. (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") granted under the HDS Investment Holding, Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan or HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended
and restated) (together, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether or not
vested or exercisable, will become fully vested and exercisable contingent
upon the Effective Time, and will be, as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased
(without regard to whether the Company Stock Option is then vested) had such
holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_
to the holders of Company Stock Options, without any interest thereon and less
applicable Tax withholding, will be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon
as practicable after, and in any event within five Business Days following,
the Effective Time. Any Company Stock Option with an applicable exercise price
that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration will automatically be
cancelled and terminated without consideration at the Effective Time.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the vesting, repurchase or
other lapse restrictions applicable to each then-outstanding Share of
restricted stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Stock-
Based Award_ ") will lapse and, to the extent not previously vested,
contingent upon the Effective Time, be deemed fully vested, and such Company
Stock-Based Award will be, as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time,
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, without any interest thereon and less applicable Tax
withholding.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit or similar right, in each case
representing a right to receive one Share granted under the Company Stock
Plans (a " _Company Unit_ "), including each "performance share award"
denominated in Company Units (with the number of Company Units subject to
each performance share award fixed at the number previously determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board when the performance cycles for such
awards were truncated and scored based on performance through the end of the
2019 fiscal year), will, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, be
deemed fully vested, and such Company Unit will be, as of or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 3.3(c_). All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_ to
the holders of Company Units, without any interest thereon and less
applicable Tax withholding, will be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon
as practicable after, and in any event within five Business Days following,
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Unit that
constitutes, either in whole or in part, a deferral of compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, will, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
instead become a vested right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and less applicable
Tax withholding, payable when such Company Unit would otherwise have been
settled in accordance with its terms.

 

(d) After the date of this Agreement, no new offering period may commence
under the HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the ESPP will terminate.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company (and the Board and any applicable committees thereof) will take
all actions and adopt such resolutions as are reasonably necessary or as may
be required to give effect to and accomplish the treatment of Company Stock
Options, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Units (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Awards_ ") and the treatment of the ESPP, in each case as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

presently conducted requires such qualification, except in each case where (i)
the failure of any of the Companys Subsidiaries to be so organized, existing,
qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority or (ii) the
failure of the Company to be so qualified, be in good standing as a foreign

Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as
amended through the date of this Agreement, and each as so made available is

(b) Except as described in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ and except for
changes resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or the vesting

Company to issue, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its capital

redemption of shares of such Subsidiaries capital stock or any other
agreements of any kind which may obligate any Subsidiary of the Company to
issue, purchase, register for sale, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its
capital stock.

for issuance as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_, from the Measurement
Date to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not declared or paid any
dividend or distribution in respect of the Shares, and has not issued, sold,
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any Shares, and its Board has not
authorized any of the foregoing.

(e) Except for awards to acquire or receive shares of Common Stock under a
Company Stock Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations, the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the Stockholders on any matter.

 

(f) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

has the requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by

their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (the foregoing
recommendations in clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_,
collectively, the " _Company Recommendation_ "), which resolutions have not
been rescinded, modified or withdrawn, except after the date of this Agreement
as permitted by this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 6.2_. Except for the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The Board has received the opinion of Goldman Sachs and Co. (the "
_Company Financial Advisor_ ") to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, the $56.00 per Share to be paid to the
holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view and as promptly as practicable a copy of such opinion
will be provided by the Company to Parent, solely for informational purposes,
following the date of this Agreement.

(each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation
of the Merger, except those that the failure to make or obtain, as the case
may be, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company (in the case of the consummation of
the Merger), (ii) a breach or violation of any Law applicable to the Company
or any Subsidiary, or (iii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a

Filing filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not, and each Company Filing

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed, and since January 29, 2018, have been
reasonably designed, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company is recorded and reported to the individuals responsible for the

proscribed in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ by delivering written notice. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
acknowledge and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries operations, (iii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no consent of
Parent will be required with respect to any matter set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent the
requirement of such consent would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law, and (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parents consent will not be required for the Company to take, or
fail to take, any action set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_,  _Section_ __
_ 6.1(e)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.1(l)_ if the Company determines in good
faith that such action or inaction is reasonably necessary in light of then-
current operating conditions and developments with respect to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of COVID-19; _provided_ , in the
case of this clause (iv), that the Company will provide reasonable advance
notice to and consult with Parent prior to any such action or inaction and
will keep Parent fully informed on a current basis with respect to such action
or inaction.

 

6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will,
and the Company will cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Person or group
that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. With respect to
any Person or group with whom such discussions or negotiations have been
terminated, the Company will request that such Person or group promptly return
or destroy in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement any information furnished by or on behalf of the Company.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, from the
date following the date hereof until the Offer Closing (the " _No-Shop
Period_"), the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the Company will not
authorize, direct or knowingly permit its Representatives to, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to, or provide
any non-public information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
to any Person relating to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal (for avoidance of
doubt, it being understood that the foregoing will not prohibit the Company or
the Company Representatives from making such Person aware of the restrictions
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ in response to the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal), or (iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or agreement in principle or any other agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an
" _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company will not, and will
cause its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any
standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates is a party; _provided_ that, with respect to any Person that did
not express an interest in obtaining information or otherwise evaluating the
Company during the period between August 10, 2020 and the date of this
Agreement, if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third party to make a confidential Acquisition Proposal
to the Board.

 



-28- 

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section_ __ _
6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ at any time during the No-Shop Period, if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal from any Person the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide information
(including non-public information and data) regarding, and afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company receives from such
Person (or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement,  _provided_ that the Company promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) makes available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access that was not previously made available to the Parent and
(ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that
prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Board
determines in good faith and after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 

(d) During the No-Shop Period, the Company will promptly after knowledge by
the Company of receipt (and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of
receipt), notify Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt by the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information from, or
any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed with, either the Company
or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition Proposal, which notice will,
to the extent providing such information will not constitute a violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of a confidentiality agreement in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, include (i) a copy of any Acquisition
Proposal (including any financing commitments) made in writing and other
written terms or proposals provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal
not made in writing or any such inquiry or request. The Company will keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within
24 hours) of any material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposal or
requests for non-public information from the proponent of an Acquisition
Proposal and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, will apprise Parent of
the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect to any of the
foregoing. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will, after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit them
from providing such information or the information contemplated by the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ to Parent.

 

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, the Board will not
(i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent (or publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (C) publicly approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend to the Stockholders, an Acquisition
Proposal, (D) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock
of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Stockholders within ten Business Days after commencement or (E) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within two (2) Business Days
after the Company receives a written request from Parent to do so (any of the
foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt or
approve or publicly propose to authorize, adopt or approve, an Acquisition
Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Board may (I) effect a Change of
Recommendation if the Board determines (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that, as a result of a development or change in circumstances
that occurs or arises after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(other than a Superior Proposal) that was not known or reasonably foreseeable
(or the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) to the
Board prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (an "
_Intervening Event_ "), the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation could
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ that no change in the price or trading
volume of the Common Stock or the common stock of Parent will be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred
(it being understood, however, that any underlying cause thereof may be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether a Intervening Event has
occurred); and (II) effect a Change of Recommendation

 



-29- 

    

 if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its independent
financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt, or
approve such Superior Proposal and cause or permit the Company to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may only take the actions described
in (1) clause (II) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ concurrently with entering into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and pays the applicable Company Termination Fee in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ and (2) clauses (I) or (II) if:

 

(x) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent (which notice
itself will not constitute a Change of Recommendation) of its or the Boards
intention to take such actions at least four Business Days in advance of
taking such action, which notice will specify, as applicable, the material
circumstances of such Intervening Event or the information and documents
required to be furnished pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ and any financing
commitments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

 

(y) the Board has considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement
and the financing or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by,
and would be legally binding upon, Parent by 5:00 PM New York City, New York
time on the fourth Business Day of such four Business Day period and have
determined (A) with respect to the actions described in clause (II), after
consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial advisors, that
the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause
(I), after consultation with outside counsel, that it would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to
effect the Change of Recommendation, in each case, if such changes offered in
writing by Parent in a definitive agreement were given effect; and

(z) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including
the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other change
to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (x) above, and a new notice period under clause (x) shall commence,
during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of clause (y) above and this clause (z).

 

(f) Subject to the proviso in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_, nothing
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ will be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Board from (i) taking such actions as the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel are required to
comply with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal or any other matter, including taking and
disclosing to its Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders
in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange
offer) ( _provided_ that any such action may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Change of Recommendation) or (ii)
publishing any "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the Stockholders);
_provided_ that neither the Board nor any committee thereof will effect a
Change of Recommendation unless the applicable requirements of _Section_ __ _
6.2(e)_ have been satisfied.

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
use (and cause its Affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts (subject to,
and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be
taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities
and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and all
consents, approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably requested by
Parent to be obtained in respect of the Company Material Contracts in
connection with the Offer, 

 



-30- 

    

 the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure to receive any such consents,
approvals or waivers will not be a condition to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations hereunder), and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay
prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract or to incur any
material cost or expense in the performance hereof.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent will (i) promptly, (A)
but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
make their respective filings and thereafter make any other required
submissions under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law, (ii)
except in connection with a disclosure regarding a Change of Recommendation or
an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are
required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or
approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other
Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) promptly inform the other
party, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of), receipt of any
communication from or to the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental
Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(v) subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Offer or the Merger. Except in connection with a disclosure regarding a
Change of Recommendation or an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company,
the Company and Parent will permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to (A)
participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate, (B) extend any waiting period under the HSR Act
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (C) enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that it is Parents primary
right to devise and implement the strategy for all filings, notifications,
submissions and communications in connection with any filing, notice,
petition, statement, registration, submission of information, application or
similar filing subject to this Section 6.3 after consulting with, and taking
into account in good faith any comments of, the Company relating to
such strategy.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent will cooperate in all respects with each other and will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions 

 



-31- 

    

 contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of
the foregoing, in order to resolve such action or proceeding or threat thereof
which, if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby beyond the Outside Date, Parent will
agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business
in a manner which would resolve such actions or proceedings (or agree to do
any of the foregoing) to the extent necessary to resolve such action or
proceeding or threat thereof so that the Offer Closing, the Closing and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated by the
Outside Date; provided, however, that anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Parent will not be required to, and the Company may
not, take or agree to take any such action that, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect
on (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, considered on a
standalone basis or (ii) on Parents maintenance, repair and operations
business, considered on a combined basis with the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ will limit
a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_
so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

6.4 _Access and Reports_. (a) The Company will afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, through the
Effective Time, to its and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, properties,
Contracts, books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed
or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and will
furnish Parent with financial, operating and other data and information as
Parent, through its respective officers, employees or other authorized
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to
afford access pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ if such access would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
would cause a violation of any confidentiality agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof (or to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries becomes a party after the date hereof in
the Ordinary Course) or would violate any policy of the Company implemented to
protect health and safety in light of COVID-19, nor will Parent or any of its
Representatives be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including any
onsite environmental study) with respect to any property of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ will not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to permit any access, or to disclose any information that the
Company determines is likely to result in any violation of any Law or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the Company or its
Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information; _provided_ that the parties hereto will cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so
would not be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such Law or
be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information.

 

6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
substantially in the form previously agreed to by Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will, and the Company
will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of
any press release or similar public announcement with respect to, or otherwise
make any public statement concerning, this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
first consulting with Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or
statement by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ will not apply to any release or public
statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or Change of Recommendation or any action taken pursuant
thereto ( _provided_ that the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_
will apply to any such release or statement), or (b) as a party may in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, determine is required by
Law. 

 



-32- 

    

6.6 _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation,
its Subsidiaries and their permitted successors and assigns to honor and
perform in accordance with their terms (or as subsequently amended or
terminated as permitted pursuant to their terms) all employment or
compensatory Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any past or present employee or consultant of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other (including all retention awards and
employment, employment continuation, severance, incentive, change in control
and termination Contracts disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 4.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule).

 

(b) During the period of 12 months beginning on the Effective Time, Parent
will provide or cause to be provided to each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who continue employment with Parent or any
of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries (each, an " _Affected Employee_ "),
while employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, compensation and
benefits which, in the aggregate, are at least substantially comparable to the
compensation and benefits provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time (commencing from and after January 1, 2021, without
giving effect to any temporary general reduction in base wages or salary made
by the Company in response to COVID-19); _provided_ that during such 12 month
period (i) each Affected Employee, while employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, will be provided base wages or salary and target annual cash
incentive opportunities that are not less than the base wages or salary and
target annual cash incentive opportunities, in each case provided to such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (commencing from and
after January 1, 2021, without giving effect to any temporary general
reduction in base wages or salary made by the Company in response to
COVID-19) and (ii) each Affected Employee who is not party to an individual
agreement providing for severance or termination benefits and is terminated
under severance qualifying circumstances will be eligible to receive cash
severance benefits in an amount that is not less favorable than those provided
to such Affected Employee and as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to the timely execution and
effectiveness of a release of claims.

(c) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans in which the Affected
Employees are entitled to participate after the Effective Time to take into
account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual thereunder, service for the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (except (i) for benefit accrual or pay credit purposes under
any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) under any benefit plan that is a frozen
benefit plan or provides grandfathered benefits, (iii) under any retiree
medical plans or arrangements, (iv) with respect to any equity
incentive awards granted by Parent or (v) to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of
service), and Affected Employees will be immediately eligible to participate
in any such plan(s), without any waiting time, to the extent such Affected
Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any health benefit plan
replaces a Company Benefit Plan that is a health benefit plan following the
Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee for the plan
year in which such Affected Employee is first eligible to participate, to the
extent waived or satisfied under the replaced Company Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to credit
each Affected Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-
pocket expenses paid prior to the Effective Time under the terms of the
replaced Company Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year in which such Affected
Employee is first eligible to participate.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or any other provision

of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy 

 



-33- 

    

 or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by
any of them in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable Law, (iii)
will create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person
(including any Affected Employee or any participant in any Company Benefit
Plan) other than the parties to this Agreement or any right to employment or
service, or continued employment or service, or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) will limit,
restrict or interfere in any way with the right of Parent (or
its Subsidiaries) to discharge or terminate, for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause, in accordance with applicable Law, the employment or service
of any employee or other service-provider at or following the Effective Time.

 

6.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such
expense.

 

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_. (a)
To the fullest extent required or permitted by Law, (i) from and after the
Offer Closing and through the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Company
and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses as incurred
to, each present and former director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, together with any Person listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule who, as of the date of this Agreement, is
entitled to be indemnified under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "
_Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Partys service as a director,
officer or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such Persons at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, in connection with (x) the Offer, the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the process and other events
giving rise thereto and (y) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event
of any such action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such action.

 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to the extent they provide for indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, on the same basis as set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company in effect on the date
of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by
applicable Law, which provisions will not be amended except as required by
applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would
enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Parties indemnification rights
thereunder.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies for the Indemnified Parties and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies with respect to any
matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). Whether pursuant to such tail policy or otherwise, the Surviving
Corporation will continue to maintain in effect 

 



-34- 

    

 for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time DandO
Insurance with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation will use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or entity and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
unless provided by operation of Law, proper provisions will be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume all of the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. This _Section_ __ _
6.8_ may not be amended after the Effective Time in a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party will have consented
in writing to such amendment.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
who are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ as of
and following the Effective Time.

 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_
will be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or comparable governing documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.
All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will survive the Merger and will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

6.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company (including the Board) and Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board will be
permitted to take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause dispositions of Company equity securities pursuant to transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or will be subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

6.11 _Parent Vote_. Parent will vote (or consent, by written action in
lieu of a meeting, with respect to) all shares of common stock of Merger Sub
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the consummation
by Merger Sub of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.12 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Offer Closing Date,
the Compensation Committee of the Board will take all such steps as may be
required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding that has been

 



-35- 

    

 or will be entered into by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which compensation, severance or other
benefits (including the treatment of Company Stock Awards as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_) is paid to such officer, director or employee to be
approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act and
to otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set
forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 

6.13 _Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness_. (a) Prior to the Closing,
the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, at the written request
of Parent, (i) deliver notices of prepayment and/or notices for termination of
commitments within the time periods required by the Existing Credit Facilities
and (ii) obtain and deliver to Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing (x) customary payoff letters providing for the termination of the
Existing Credit Facilities and the termination and release of all guarantees
thereof and Liens related thereto and setting forth the payoff amount in
connection with such termination and release, (y) customary release
documentation that is necessary for the release of all Liens securing the
Existing Credit Facilities and (z) if applicable, instruments of discharge to
be delivered at Closing to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in
full on the Closing Date of the Existing Credit Facilities and all guarantees
thereof and Liens related thereto; _provided_ that any such notice or payoff
letter will be expressly conditioned on the Closing, in each case to
facilitate Parents prepayment and termination of the Existing Credit
Facilities.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the
redemption, satisfaction and/or discharge of the Existing Notes by the
Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time pursuant to the Existing
Indenture (the " _Redemption_ "), including (i) delivering any notices,
certificates and opinions with respect to redemption, satisfaction and/or
discharge of the Existing Notes as may be required by the Existing Indenture
within the time periods specified therein (it being understood that in no
event will the Company be required to deliver any notices to redeem,
repurchase, satisfy or discharge any Existing Notes prior to the Effective
Time unless such notice is conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective
Time) and (ii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the
Existing Indenture to limit notice periods as permitted by the Indenture,
execute any documents and take any actions that may be required prior to the
Effective Time in order to facilitate or consummate the Redemption pursuant
to the provisions of the Existing Indenture.

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

, _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
(i) the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_,  _Section_ __ _
1.1(g)_, _Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement will survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein will relieve the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub from liability for (A) any Deliberate and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in

 



-37- 

    

 this Agreement occurring prior to such termination or (B) in the case of
Parent or Merger Sub, any failure of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer as provided by this Agreement notwithstanding satisfaction of all the
Offer Conditions (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Offer Closing), and any aggrieved party will be entitled to
all rights and remedies at law or in equity, including the right of the
aggrieved party to seek the benefit of its bargain (in the case of the
Company, the bargain lost by the Stockholders). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Deliberate_ " means an action or failure to act by or with
the consent of an officer, director or partner of the party where such Person
has actual knowledge (or should have knowledge) that such action or failure to
act will constitute a breach of this Agreement; _provided_ ___however_ ,
that failure by Parent to pay the aggregate Offer Price or the aggregate
Merger Consideration when and if required by and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement will be deemed Deliberate whether or not any financing is
available to Parent or Merger Sub.

(b) The Company will pay to Parent or one or more Persons designated by
Parent a termination fee of $275,000,000 in cash (the " _Company Termination
Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as follows (it being understood that
in no event will the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on
more than one occasion):

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_, the Company will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee within
two Business Days following such termination;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3(a)_, the Company will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
substantially concurrently with such termination; and

 

(iii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, (B) an Acquisition Proposal (including a
previously communicated Acquisition Proposal) has been publicly announced or
otherwise communicated to the Board and not withdrawn at any time prior to the
date of termination, and (C) if within twelve (12) months after the date of
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate, or consummates, or recommends to its Stockholders, any Acquisition
Proposal, then (upon the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)(iii)_), the Company
will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee prior to entering into any
definitive agreement with respect to, consummating or recommending, as
applicable, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)(iii)_, the references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" will be deemed to be
references to "more than 50%." Upon the Companys payment of the Company
Termination Fee under this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ the Company will have
no further obligation to Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the
circumstances.

(c) All amounts paid pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ will be by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account directed by the
party hereto entitled to payment. Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these
agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to promptly
pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences an
action which results in a judgment against the other party (or, if such
action is commenced by the Company, against Merger Sub) for the payment set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, such paying party will pay the other party
its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment.

Law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify

parties hereto (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the

agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such
action, any claim that they are not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts, that the property is exempt or immune from attachment
or execution, that any such action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
the venue of such action is improper or that this Agreement or the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or
by any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any action or

damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Subject to the other provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, the parties
acknowledge and agree (and further agree not to take any contrary position in
any litigation concerning this Agreement) that (a) the parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligations of the
parties hereto to consummate the Offer Closing and the Merger) without proof
of damages or otherwise, and that such relief may be sought in addition to and
will not limit, diminish, or otherwise impair, any other

 



-39- 

    

 remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and

enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of Company, Parent or Merger Sub would
have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
