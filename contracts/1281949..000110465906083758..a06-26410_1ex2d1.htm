funds (the " _Restricted Stock Unit Cash-Out Payment_ ") to the Surviving
Corporation and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
holder of a Cashed-Out Restricted Stock Unit Award the amounts contemplated
by this _Section 2.4(f)(ii)_ , as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time and in any case within two (2) Business Days thereafter. Buyer

(iii) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall suspend the Company
ESPP so that no new purchase periods (as defined in the Company ESPP) shall
commence and no new participants shall enroll in the Company ESPP after the
date hereof. The current purchase period in progress under the Company ESPP
shall terminate pursuant to its terms and any purchase rights existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company ESPP to acquire a
share of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled at the Effective Time (each,
a " _Cashed-Out ESPP Purchase Right_ "). Each holder of a Cashed-Out ESPP
Purchase Right shall be eligible to receive at the Effective Time an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to (A) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the purchase price payable by the holder to acquire
such share

     

   

of Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP, multiplied
by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the purchase rights, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required
by Law to be withheld in respect of such payment. Buyer shall transfer the
necessary funds (the " _ESPP Cash-Out Payment_ ") to the Surviving
Corporation and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
holder of a Cashed-Out ESPP Purchase Right the amounts contemplated by this
_Section 2.4(f)(iii)_ , as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and
in any case within two (2) Business Days thereafter. Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay any amounts withheld for withholding Taxes
promptly to the appropriate Governmental Authority on behalf of such holder
of a Cashed-Out ESPP Purchase Right.  In addition, as soon as practicable

thereafter, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to return to
participants their respective accumulated payroll contributions and optional
cash payments not applied to the purchase of Company Common Stock under the
Company ESPP, if any.

  

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice to each

terms, the Company shall take all actions necessary so that each such plan
shall terminate at the Effective Time.

  

(vi) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, in consultation with Buyer,
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as Buyer shall
reasonably request in connection with obtaining any necessary consents to
give effect to the treatment of Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units
and participants in the Company ESPP as contemplated by this _Section 2.4(f)_
, to the extent that such treatment is not expressly provided for by the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plans, Company ESPP or related
award agreements; _provided_ , that the failure to obtain any such consents
shall not be considered a breach for purposes of _Section 7.2(a)_ solely
with respect to _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ or
_Section 8.1(g)_ hereof.

shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has demanded and validly
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such appraisal rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , but the holder thereof shall
only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _subsection (i)_ above, if any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands purchase of such shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights, then, as of
the later of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the occurrence of such event, such
holders shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in this _Section 2.4_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, of the Company
Stock Certificate.

  

(iii) The Company shall give Buyer (A) prompt notice of its receipt of any
written demands for appraisal rights and any withdrawals of such demands, and
(B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make any
payment with respect to any demands for purchase of Company Common Stock
pursuant to appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle or approve any
withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands.

  

(h) _Conversion of Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At and as of the Effective

(a) _Deposit of Funds_.  Immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with Bank of New
York or a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Company
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash (the " _Payment Fund_ ") sufficient in the
aggregate for the Paying Agent to make full payment of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of all of the outstanding Company Common Stock
(other

     

   

than any Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common Stock held by Buyer,
Holdings, the Company or Merger Sub, or any Subsidiary of Buyer, Holdings,
the Company or Merger Sub) which such holders are entitled to
receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. On or simultaneously with the Closing Date, the Company
(solely in its capacity as the Surviving Corporation), Buyer, Holdings,
Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall enter into a paying agent agreement, on
terms and conditions that are reasonably satisfactory to the parties hereto.

  

(b) _Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such
customary provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify
(including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the
Paying Agent and provisions regarding those Company Stock Certificates held
in book-entry form) to each record holder of Company Common Stock outstanding
at the Effective Time for the holder to use in surrendering the Company Stock
Certificate against payment of the Merger Consideration. No interest will
accrue or be paid to the holder of any outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
Paying Agent shall make full payment of the Merger Consideration (less
applicable withholding Taxes) to each holder of Company Common Stock (other
than any Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common Stock held by Buyer,
Holdings, the Company or Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Buyer, Holdings, the
Company or Merger Sub) within three (3) Business Days after such stockholder
surrenders such stockholders Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent
(or an affidavit to the effect that their Company Stock Certificates shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed in accordance with _Section 2.7_ to
the Paying Agent) and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate surrendered is registered,
if such certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance establishes to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that the prior transfer was valid; _provided_
 that it shall be a condition of payment that the Person who surrenders
such Company Stock Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Company Stock Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that the Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  

(c) _Investment of Payment Fund_.  Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to invest
the cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable or the timing of payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration, and
that the terms and conditions of the investments shall be such as to permit
the Paying Agent to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger

     

   

Consideration, as necessary.  Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to
the Surviving Corporation any net earnings with respect to the investments,
and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to replace promptly any
portion of the Payment Fund which the Paying Agent loses through investments.

and thereafter all former stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to
look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the cash
payable upon surrender of their Company Stock Certificates. Any portion of
the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by former stockholders of the Company as
of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would

to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any

Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, such amounts
as they are respectively required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and
Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificates to provide an indemnity or deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that

     

   

may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company
Stock Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

Section 2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of either the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take, and will take, all
such lawful and reasonably necessary action.

of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of the text of
such disclosure to be applicable to the representation set forth in the

Section 3.1 _Due Organization of Company_.

  

(a) The Company and each of the Material Subsidiaries are duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
their organization. The Company and each of the Material Subsidiaries have
the corporate power and authority to carry on their business as they are now
being conducted and to own all of their properties and assets, except where
the failure to have such corporate power has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and the charter, bylaws,
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement and other
organizational documents of the Material Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof have been made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof. The
Company and each of the Material Subsidiaries are duly qualified as foreign
corporations to do business, and are in good standing (to the extent the
concept of good standing exists), in each jurisdiction where the character of
their properties owned or held under lease or the nature of their activities
makes such

     

   

qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and each of
the Material Subsidiaries have all business licenses, permits and approvals
necessary to conduct their business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such permit or approval has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Material Subsidiaries is
in material violation of any of the provisions of its organizational
documents.

  

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company, including the
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary. Except for its interests in
its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any other Person.  Other
than the Material Subsidiaries, each of the other Subsidiaries of the Company
is not a "significant subsidiary" as defined by Regulation S-X of the
Securities Act.

  

Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.

of Company Stock Options outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, no shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Restricted Stock Units or
other equity securities of the Company have been issued and no Company Stock
Options have been granted. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
are, and all shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance, upon

which they are issuable will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and

Unit or other equity-based award outstanding, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable thereunder, expiration date and exercise price related
thereto and the Company Stock Option Plan pursuant to which each such Company
Stock Option, Restricted Stock Unit or other equity-based award was granted.

  

(d) Except for the Company Stock Options and the Restricted Stock Units,
there are no (i) existing options, warrants, calls, subscription rights,
Contracts, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments
(contingent or otherwise) that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any Company Common Stock or any other

Subsidiaries, or any investment or security that is convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for any such shares or interests (collectively, "

matter (collectively, " _Voting Debt_ ", and together with Convertible
Securities, Other Securities, Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units, the " _Company Interests_
").

  

(e) There are no Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or bound (i) with respect to the voting or disposing of any shares of
the Company Common Stock or any capital stock of any Subsidiary of the
Company, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, are there any third party agreements or understandings with
respect to the voting of any such shares, (ii) requiring the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
outstanding securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii)
requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other Person,
except in the case of Subsidiaries of the Company that comprise the AFC
Business Unit, for loans made in the ordinary course of business of the AFC
Business Unit.

  

(f) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Material Subsidiary is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and was issued
in compliance in all material respects with applicable securities Laws, and
each such share is owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens.

30   

 

  

obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions

or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer, Holdings and Merger Sub, this Agreement is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification, however, that
enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby is subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general principles of equity affecting the availability of
specific performance and other equitable remedies. The Board of Directors of
the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has duly (i) approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and (ii) determined that the terms of this Agreement are fair to
and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders.

of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment,
modification, acceleration or cancellation) under, or result in the
triggering of any payments or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to, any
Company Permit or Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iv) conflict with or result
in a breach of or default under any judgment, decree, order or ruling to

(and none of their respective officers or directors) is engaged in, or a
party to, and none of their assets or properties are subject to, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened with, any legal action,
formal investigation or other proceeding before any Governmental Authority,

or invalidate, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii)
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There
is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule, writ or order of any Governmental

any information, furnished by the Company to the SEC solely for the purposes
of complying with Regulation FD promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange

the Company or any Material Subsidiary pursuant to, in connection with, or as
a result of, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(c) Subject to any applicable grace periods, the Company has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of

established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud or
allegation of fraud, whether or not material, known to management that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date hereof,

(within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return, or included or required to be included in any

the common parent, which would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to be liable for Taxes under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6; or (ii) is
liable for Taxes of another Person (other than another Subsidiary of the
Company) either by Contract or by reason of being a transferee or successor

litigation or administrative proceeding relating to any material Taxes.

for greater certainty, excluding pension or other retirement income benefits,
with respect to employees or former employees of the Company or a Canadian
Subsidiary beyond

     

   

retirement or other termination of service benefits, except for coverage
extended during any notice period applicable to any such employee or former
employee pursuant to Applicable Law and such promises and provisions of
benefits which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof true,
correct and complete copies, summaries or written descriptions of the
Canadian Employee Plans.

the Company Employee Plans and the Canadian Employee Plans that were required
to be made in accordance with their terms have been timely made.

  

(h) Except as expressly required or expressly permitted by this Agreement,
none of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will (i) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination
of employment after the date hereof; (ii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under, any Company Employee
Plan or Canadian Employee Plan; (iii) result in any material breach or
violation of, or a default under, any Company Employee Plan or Canadian
Employee Plan; or (iv) result in any payment that would be a "parachute
payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section
280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the
future.

and negotiated with Buyer (to the extent Buyer wishes such cooperation) to
enable Buyer to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that it is able to make a Superior Offer if it wishes to do
so; and (C) after taking into account any revised proposal that may be made
by Buyer since receipt of the notice described above, the Companys Board
of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that Buyer has not made a
Superior Offer on or prior to the expiration of such five (5) Business Day
period, then, and only then, the Companys Board of Directors may enter into
a Superior Proposal Agreement and concurrently terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_.

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
filing with the SEC a current report on Form 8-K to report the execution of
this Agreement and file a copy of this Agreement and any ancillary agreement
as exhibits to such a report.

  

Section 5.4 _Conduct of Business by Buyer Parties Pending the Merger_. During
the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, except as
required by this Agreement, no Buyer Party shall, without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or
permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into that would
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Subsidiaries of
Buyer, the Equity Sponsors and IAAI shall, and shall not cause any Person to,
acquire (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or
otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any material amounts of assets of or any
equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, unless that
acquisition or agreement would not reasonably be expected to (i) materially
increase the risk of not obtaining any authorizations, consents, orders,
declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
Applicable Law; or (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.

  

 **ARTICLE VI**

  

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

  

Section 6.1 _Stockholder Approvals_. As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholder Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of obtaining the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger. The Company, acting through its

     

   

Board of Directors, and subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_  and
_Section 5.3(g)_ will (i) recommend to its stockholders the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ "), and shall include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement; and (ii) not rescind its authorization or approval of
this Agreement and the Merger, subject in each case to the Company making a
Change in Recommendation pursuant to the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ and
_Section 5.3(g)_  hereof. Subject to _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section 5.3(g)_ ,
the Company will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
Merger and will use reasonable best efforts to take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. The Company shall keep
Buyer updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Buyer.

  

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement_.

  

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable
a preliminary Proxy Statement, which shall comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff
and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders
as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the
satisfaction of the SEC staff. The Company shall notify Buyer promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and will supply Buyer with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail
to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, prior to filing and mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such
document shall provide the other party an opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response and shall include in such document or response,
comments reasonably proposed by the other party. In addition, the Company
will provide Buyer with the opportunity to participate in any substantive
conference calls or discussions between the Company and the SEC, or any
Representative of the Company and the SEC, concerning the Proxy Statement.

  

(b) Buyer shall furnish the Company with all information concerning Buyer
required for use in the Proxy Statement, and Buyer shall take such other
action as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, including any amendments or supplements
thereto. Buyer shall vote or cause to be voted by proxy or otherwise all
shares of Company Common Stock held or voting of which is controlled by,
directly or indirectly, the Buyer Parties for the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger.

     

   

Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, financing
sources, counsel and other Representatives of the Buyer Parties, reasonable
access at normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all of their properties, books, Contracts, commitments, work papers,
financial information and records. The Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Buyer all information concerning their
business, properties and personnel and such other financial and operating
data and other information as Buyer may reasonably request, and shall make
available to Buyer the appropriate individuals (including
attorneys, accountants and other professionals or Representatives) for
discussion of the business, properties and personnel of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company as Buyer may reasonably request.  The Company
shall, with respect to fiscal months ending after the date of this Agreement,
furnish to Buyer promptly, such financial information as is customarily
provided to the Companys management for each fiscal month then ended. Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to schedule and coordinate with the Company
(i) all inspections, onsite procedures or investigations (including any
onsite environmental investigations or studies); (ii) contacts or discussions
with any employees, agents or Representatives of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (other than senior officers of the Company); and
(iii) contacts or discussions with any landlords/sublandlords, customers,
suppliers or licensees or franchisees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, and shall give the Company prior notice thereof, setting forth such
inspection, contact or discussion that Buyer or its Representatives intend to
conduct. Except for inspections of information or other due diligence
documents, the Company shall be entitled to have Representatives present at
all times during any such inspection, contact or discussion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall
be required to provide access to any information, property or personnel
if (w) the Company believes in good faith that such access is prohibited
by the terms of any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof, (x)
such access would, in the Companys good faith opinion after consultation
with legal counsel, result in a loss of the Companys attorney-client, work
product or similar legal privilege (it being understood that in the case of
clause (w) and (x), the parties shall each use reasonable best efforts to
cause the maximum amount of such information to be provided in a manner that
does not result in such violation), (y) any Applicable Law requires the
Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such information, properties or
personnel, or (z) such access would unreasonably disrupt the businesses and
operations of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. The relevant
parties will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence applies.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.3_
 or otherwise shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth herein or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto or any remedies available to the parties hereunder.

  

(b) The Buyer Parties shall keep all information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.3_ confidential in accordance with the terms of the non-disclosure
agreement, entered into on September 5, 2006 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between Kelso and Company and the Company.

Section 6.4 _Consents; Approvals_.

  

(a) The Company and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (and shall each
refrain from taking any willful action that would impede obtaining) all
consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders needed to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_  that the Company shall not be required to make any
payments to Third Parties other than Governmental Authorities.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to file promptly the premerger notification report, and all
other documents to be filed in connection therewith, required by the HSR Act
and the premerger notification rules promulgated thereunder with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice,
but in any event by no later than January 12, 2007. Each party shall respond
promptly to any request for additional information that may be issued by
either the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to assure that the waiting period required by
the HSR Act has expired or been terminated on or prior to the date that is
thirty (30) days after such filing. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement exceed the relevant thresholds under the Competition Act, each of
the Company and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to file its
respective premerger notification form, and all other documents to be filed
in connection therewith, required by the Competition Act and the premerger
notification regulations promulgated thereunder with the Canadian Competition
Bureau as soon as practicable following the date hereof, but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof. Each party shall
respond promptly to any request for additional information that may be issued
by the Canadian Competition Bureau and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to assure that the waiting period required by the Competition Act has expired
or been terminated on or prior to the date that is fourteen (14) days after
such filings.

  

(b) Except where prohibited by applicable statutes and regulations, and
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each party shall coordinate with
one another in preparing and exchanging such information, and shall promptly
provide the other (or its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations
or submissions made by such party with any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 Each of Buyer and the Company shall make all necessary filings
with Governmental Authorities, including the SEC.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.4_
, none of Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, any Equity Sponsor or any of their
respective Affiliates, including IAAI, shall be required, in order to resolve
any objections asserted by any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act, the
Competition Act or any other foreign antitrust or combination Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to (i) divest any
of their businesses, properties or assets (or any businesses, properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether to take effect at
the Effective Time or otherwise) that (without giving effect to the Merger)
are material or that would reasonably be expected to materially impair the
expected benefits of, or cause a material reduction in the

     

   

expected synergies associated with, the Merger; (ii) take or agree to take
any other material action (including agreeing to hold separate any material
business or assets or take other similar actions); or (iii) agree to any
other material limitation or restriction; _provided_ ,  _however_ , each of
Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, Equity Sponsor and their respective Affiliates,
including IAAI, shall be required, in order to resolve any such objections,
to divest any of their or the businesses, properties or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that are not material, or take or agree to take
any other action, limitation or restriction that is not material.

  

Section 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate such that
the conditions to closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ ,
as the case may be, shall not be met; (ii) any failure of the Company, Buyer,
Holdings or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to materially comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in
_Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ , as the case may be, shall not be met;
(iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would likely cause a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be; and (iv) the receipt of
any notice or other communication in writing from any Person alleging that
the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not
(X) be given any effect for the purpose of (A) determining the accuracy of
any of the representations and warranties made by the party delivering such
notice; or (B) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VII_ has been satisfied; or (Y) limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that failure to give such notice shall not be
treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_  or
_Section 7.3(b)_ unless the failure to give such notice results in material
prejudice to the other party. Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company
if the authorized number of Buyer Units, the record and beneficial holders of
the Buyer Units or the number of shares held by them are different from the
information set forth in _Section 4.8(i)_ of the Buyers Disclosure Letter.
Should any such fact, condition or occurrence referenced herein require any
change in the Companys Disclosure Letter or the Buyers Disclosure
Letter, as the case may be, the Company or Buyer, as applicable, will
promptly deliver to the other party a supplement to the respective disclosure
letter specifying such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
supplement or notice delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ will not (a)
be deemed to become part of, or amend or otherwise effect, the disclosure
letter of the party delivering such supplement or notice; (b) qualify or
constitute an exception to the representations and warranties of such party
made as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date; (c) have
any effect on the conditions to closing set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ ; or (d)
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. The delivery of any such notice by itself shall not
be deemed an admission or an acknowledgement (x) that the subject matter of
such notice is material or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or is outside of the
ordinary course of business or inconsistent with past practice; or (y) that
there has occurred an actual or anticipatory breach of, or failure to comply
with or satisfy, any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or
agreement. In addition, the Company shall keep Buyer informed, on a current
basis, of any

     

   

material events, discussions, notices or changes with respect to any criminal
or regulatory investigation or action involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, so that Buyer, its members, stockholders and their respective
Affiliates will have the opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid or
mitigate any regulatory consequences to them that might arise from such
investigation or action.

  

Section 6.6 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in the case of the Company further subject to
exceptions related to the fiduciary duties of the Companys Board
of Directors set forth in _Section 5.3(e)_ ,  _Section 5.3(f)_ and _Section
5.3(g)_ , each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals
and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and to otherwise
satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, the Company and Buyer shall keep
each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications between the Company and
Buyer, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any
Third Party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such
transactions. The Company and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Buyer
agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release, or making any public
announcement or filing with a Governmental Authority, with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release, or make
any such public statement or filing without the prior consent of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue such press release, or make such public
statement or filing as if may upon the advice of counsel be required by
Applicable Law or a Governmental Authority if it has used reasonable efforts
to consult with the other party.

  

Section 6.8 _Taxes_. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to consult
with Buyer in the preparation, execution and filing of all material Tax
Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any Taxes,
or any transfer, recording, registration and other fees, which become payable
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are required or
permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. For U.S. federal, state
and local income Tax purposes, Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to treat the Merger as the purchase by Buyer, for the Merger
Consideration, of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_  of this Agreement, in which holders of those shares will recognize
gain or loss.

     

   

Section 6.9 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof (or following the date hereof
in compliance with _Section 5.1_ hereof) or under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or this Agreement or, if applicable,
charter, bylaws, partnership agreements, limited liability company agreement
or similar organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries of
the Company, from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer Parties and the
Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is, at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the
Effective Time, serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or
fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations consent; and
(ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security; _provided_ that the applicable Indemnified Party agrees to repay
all advanced expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. The indemnification
and advancement obligations of the Buyer Parties and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_ shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such
persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in
this _Section 6.9(a)_ : (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed action, claim, suit, arbitration, mediation or
proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified
Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such
action, claim, suit, arbitration, mediation or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration
or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties
or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of
the Company, any of its

     

   

Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing or any other person at or
prior to the Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys
fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including,
without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, as well as telecommunications, postage and
courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any
Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this _Section
6.9(a)_ , including any action, claim, suit, arbitration, mediation or
proceeding relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by
an Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (to be mutually agreed upon in
good faith by the Surviving Corporation and a plurality of the Indemnified
Parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , solely with respect to Indemnified Parties
comprising of a majority of the directors of the Company, such counsel shall
be selected exclusively by a plurality of such Indemnified Parties if the
Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Parties cannot reasonably agree
upon such counsel within thirty (30) days for all Indemnified Parties with
respect to any single Claim or related Claims (in addition to local counsel
if determined by the Indemnified Parties, in good faith, to be necessary)
except to the extent that the Surviving Corporation and a plurality of the
Indemnified Parties reasonably agree in good faith that two or more of such
Indemnified Parties have, or may reasonably be expected to have, conflicting
interests that makes the retention of separate counsel (to be selected by a
plurality of the Indemnified Parties, with the consent of the Surviving
Corporation, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
appropriate or necessary; and _provided_ ,  _however_ , that should the
Surviving Corporation and an Indemnified Party mutually determine in good
faith that it and an Indemnified Party have, or may reasonably be expected to
have, conflicting interests, such Indemnified Party may select separate
counsel. None of the Buyer Parties or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened claim, demand, action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation in respect of which indemnification has been or
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim, demand, action, suit,
arbitration, mediation, proceeding, inquiry or investigation or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, Holdings and Merger Sub agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents
or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company (or, as
applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability
company agreement or other organizational documents of any of the
Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in existence on the date hereof shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms.

     

   

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
to be maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of those
persons who are covered by such policies at the date hereof or the Effective
Time (or Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions that are at least as
beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable
carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys current carriers);
_provided_ that Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation shall first use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a "tail" policy on substantially the same
terms and conditions covering claims arising out of acts or conduct occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time and effective for claims asserted for the
full six (6)-year period referred to above, and only if it is unable after
exerting reasonable best efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, Buyer
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain such coverage
from such carriers in annual policies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no
event shall Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend on
an annual basis in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (or a one time cost
of three hundred percent (300%) of such annual premium in the case of a
"tail" policy); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premium for
such coverage exceeds such annual amount, Buyer and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase a policy with the greatest coverage available for
such two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premium (or a one
time cost of three hundred percent (300%) of such annual premium in the case
of a "tail" policy); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if certain elements of
coverage of such directors and officers liability insurance are not being
made available by national directors and officers insurance carriers after
the Effective Time, then neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to provide such coverage.

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended for the benefit of,
and may be enforced by, each Person entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 6.9_  and shall be binding on Buyer, Holdings and the Surviving
Corporation and its successors and assigns.

  

(e) In the event Buyer, Holdings or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer
Parties or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

  

Section 6.10 _Action by Buyer and Company s Boards_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to the Company Common Stock)
resulting from the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act; such steps as set forth in the
SECs no action letter dated January 12, 1999 addressed to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP shall be deemed sufficient for these purposes.

     

   

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) _U.S. Continuing Employees_.

  

(i) From and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2007, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to,
establish and maintain compensation (including, without limitation, base
salary, commission, and bonus opportunities) and benefit plans and
arrangements (including, without limitation, vacation policies, retirement
benefits, health, welfare and fringe benefits, and any severance or similar
arrangements for any Person terminated during such period from and after the
Effective Time until December 31, 2007 but excluding any equity-based
benefits, individual employment agreements, individual change in control
agreements and each of the ADESA, Inc. Director Compensation Deferral Plan,
ADESA, Inc. 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and Supplementary Retirement
Plan for Designated Employees of ADESA Canada Inc. and its Subsidiary and
Associated Companies) for all employees of the Company and Subsidiaries of
the Company who are located in the United States and will continue employment
with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof after the
Effective Time (the " _U.S. Continuing Employees_ ") that, in the aggregate,
are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and Subsidiaries of
the Company to the U.S. Continuing Employees as of the Effective Time; it
being understood that the exclusion set forth above shall not be understood
to effect the enforceability or terms of existing benefit plans or agreements
other than as expressly set forth herein. Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof that employs any
U.S. Continuing Employees to, give each U.S. Continuing Employee credit for
service with the Company and Subsidiaries of the Company prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any benefit plan
maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof in which
U.S. Continuing Employees are or become eligible to participate except where
such crediting would: (x) result in a duplication of benefits or (y)
otherwise cause Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to
accrue or pay for benefits that relate to any time period prior to the U.S.
Continuing Employees participation in such plan. Buyer agrees and agrees to
cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to, (A) provide
coverage for the U.S. Continuing Employees as of the Effective Time either
under its medical, dental, and health plans or under such other comparable
plans or arrangements as are mutually agreed upon by the parties; (B) secure
the waiver of any preexisting condition limitations, waiting periods, or
actively-at-work requirements imposed by any such plans; (C) cause such plans
to honor any expenses incurred by the U.S. Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries or eligible dependants under similar plans of the Company and
Subsidiaries of the Company during the portion of the calendar year prior to
the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
payment, and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under any such plans; and (D)
honor all vacation, sickness,

     

   

leave, holiday and personal days accrued by the U.S. Continuing Employees
prior to the Closing.

  

(ii) Nothing in this  _Section 6.11(a)_ is intended to create any employment
obligation with any U.S. Continuing Employees other than as employees at will
who may be terminated with or without cause.

  

(b) _International Continuing Employees_. In compliance with Applicable Law,
at and after the Effective Time, the employment of the employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company located in Canada and Mexico (the
" _International Continuing Employees_ " and, together with the U.S.
Continuing Employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall, immediately
following the Effective Time, continue with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or a Subsidiary thereof. Until December 31, 2007, such employment shall be
on the same terms and conditions of employment, including, without
limitation, compensation and benefit plans and arrangements (including,
without limitation, vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare
and fringe benefits, and any severance or similar arrangements) that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company to the International Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit Buyer, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or a
Subsidiary thereof from terminating any particular International Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time.

  

(c) At the Effective Time, Buyer will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to, honor the severance payments and
benefits accrued or payable under (i) the previously disclosed plans,
programs, arrangements and agreements with respect to the employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company set forth in _Section 6.11(c)_
of the Companys Disclosure Letter (it being understood that only such plans,
programs, arrangements and agreements containing severance payments and
benefits individually in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) are
required to be so set forth in such schedule; _provided_ , however, that not
setting forth such plans, programs, arrangements or agreements individually
not in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) in _Section 6.11(c)_ of the
Companys Disclosure Letter shall in no way affect the obligation of Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, to honor
the severance payments and benefits accrued or payable under such plans,
programs, arrangements or agreements), and on the terms of such plans,
programs, arrangements and agreements as in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to compliance with _Section 6.11(a)_
 and _Section 6.11(b)_ , nothing herein shall preclude termination or
amendment of such plans, programs, arrangements and agreements; or (ii) such
previously disclosed severance plans, programs, arrangements and agreements
that may be entered into before the Effective Time as required, permitted or
otherwise contemplated in accordance with _Section 5.2;_ _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to compliance with _Section 6.11(a)_  and _Section
6.11(b)_ , nothing herein shall preclude termination or amendment of such
plans, programs, arrangements and agreements. The Buyer Parties acknowledge
and agree that the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a "change of
control" of the Company and its Subsidiaries for

     

   

purposes of such plans, programs, arrangements and agreements, and agrees to
honor the provisions under such plans, programs, arrangements and agreements
relating to a change of control.

  

Section 6.12 _No Solicitation of Employees Prior to Close_.  Without the
prior written consent of the Company, prior to the Effective Time, none of
Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, IAAI, or any Equity Sponsor, directly or
indirectly, shall solicit for employment, discuss potential employment
opportunities with, or hire any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the foregoing restriction shall not prevent (i)
any Buyer Party from discussing with the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (and those executive officers designated by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company) the employment of any employee by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with consummation of the Merger; (ii) any
Buyer Party from employing any Company employee upon the consummation of this
Merger; or (iii) Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, IAAI, or any Equity Sponsor
from making general solicitations for employment or employing any person who
either responds to such general solicitations or otherwise contacts such
party on his or her own initiative without solicitation, directly or
indirectly, by Buyer, Holdings, Merger Sub, IAAI or any Equity Sponsor
in contravention of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.12_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.12_ supersede any and all prior agreements
relating to solicitation of employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, including such provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

Section 6.13 _Financing_.

  

(a) Buyer, Holdings and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts
to (i) arrange for the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letters; (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing; (iii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Buyer,
Holdings and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within their
control; and (iv) consummate the Financing no later than the earlier of (A)
the last day of the Marketing Period and (B) the Final Date. In the event any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Commitment Letters for any reason, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the last day of the Marketing
Period and (B) the Final Date; _provided_  that such obligation shall be
limited to obtaining alternative financing on comparable or more favorable
terms, in the aggregate, to Buyer than as contemplated by the Commitment
Letters (as determined in the reasonable good-faith judgment of Buyer).
Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days)
provide the Company with the documentation evidencing the alternative sources
of financing and shall give the Company prompt notice (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days) of it (or any of the Equity Sponsors or
IAAI) becoming aware of any material breach by any party to the Commitment
Letters or any termination of the Commitment Letters.  Buyer shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange for the Financing (or replacements thereof),
including providing the Company with information about the equity rollover
and refinancing of IAAI as the Company may reasonably request, and shall not
permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters (or
replacements thereof) without first consulting with the Company.

     

   

Without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not directly
or indirectly take any action that (x) would or would be reasonably expected
to result in the Financing not being available at or prior to the earlier of
(A) the last day of the Marketing Period and (B) the Final Date, or (y) would
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event (X) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield
financing has not been consummated; (Y) all closing conditions contained in
_Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ (other than the
actual delivery of the certificates described therein and the actual receipt
of the proceeds from the Debt Financing) have been satisfied; and (Z) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or alternative
bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or
replacements thereof), then Buyer, Holdings and Merger Sub shall cause the
proceeds of such bridge financing to be used to replace such high yield
financing no later than the earlier of (A) the last day of the Marketing
Period and (B) the Final Date.

  

(b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to provide to Buyer all reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably required by Buyer
( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time)
including, without limitation, (i) using reasonable best efforts to cause its
officers and employees to be available, during normal working hours and upon
reasonable notice, to meet with the Lenders or Equity Sponsors in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions,
due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to assist with the preparation of disclosure
materials customarily included in documents associated with this type of
Financing and reasonably required in connection with the Financing; (iii)
using reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountants,
consistent with their customary practice, to provide reasonable assistance
and cooperation to Buyer, including, without limitation, accounting due
diligence sessions, and providing consent to Buyer to use their audit reports
relating to the Company and any "comfort letters," in each case on customary
terms and consistent with their customary practice in connection with the
Financing; (iv) executing and delivering definitive financing documents,
including pledge and security documents, subsidiary guarantees or other
certificates, legal opinions of the Companys counsel regarding customary
corporate matters or documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and
reasonably required in connection with the Financing (including certificates
of the chief financial officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to solvency matters) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral (including, without limitation, assisting Buyer in the
preparation and negotiation of mortgages, granting such mortgages, assisting
in obtaining title policies, resolving exceptions on such title policies
which are objected to by the lenders of the Debt Financing); _provided_  that
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such agreement, document or pledge shall be effective until the Effective
Time; (v) providing access to people and information as set forth in _Section
6.3_ ; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain surveys and title
insurance reasonably requested by Buyer and required in connection with the
Financing; (vii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish to Buyer and its

     

   

financing sources with the Required Financial Information and all
other financial information regarding the Company reasonably requested by
Buyer and required in connection with the Financing, including all financial
statements and data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K, including audits thereof to the extent so required, and the other
accounting rules and regulations of the SEC, that is of the type and form
customarily included in a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any
applicable successor form) under the Securities Act for a public offering to
consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters; (viii) taking all actions reasonably requested by Buyer
and otherwise required in connection with the Financing to (A) permit the
Lenders to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing, consistent with customary practice in
connection with the Financing; _provided_  that no right of any Lender, nor
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, thereunder shall be
effective until the Effective Time; (ix) entering into one or more credit or
other agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer as required in
connection with the Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to enter into any purchase
agreement for any high-yield debt financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such credit or
other agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time; and (x) taking
all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time,
reasonably requested by Buyer and consistent with customary practice to
permit the consummation of the Financing and the direct borrowing or
incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Financing, including any high yield
debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon any private placement memoranda or
similar documents, or any materials for rating agencies, that include
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared
in connection with the Financing, and Buyer/Holdings/Merger Sub shall include
in such memoranda, documents or other materials, comments reasonably proposed
by the Company. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the voiding, termination and/or
destruction of all documents executed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation in the Financing. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Companys obligation to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Financing shall apply to the
Financing solely with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, and neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective officers or directors shall be required to execute
any certificate, representation letter or other certification, or to deliver,
or cause to be delivered, any legal opinion that is not customary or would be
unreasonable for the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters.

  

(c) All non-public information or otherwise Proprietary Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) regarding the Company obtained by
any of the Buyer Parities or its Representatives pursuant to
_Section 6.13(b)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

     

   

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letters may be superseded
at the option of Buyer after the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time by instruments (the " _New Commitment Letters_ ")
which replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters or the existing Equity
Commitment Letters and/or contemplate co-investment by or financing from one
or more other or additional parties; _provided_ that (i) the New Commitment
Letters do not decrease the aggregate Equity Financing as set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letters delivered on the date hereof, (ii) any new
or substitute Equity Sponsors enter into guarantees with the Company
on substantially the same terms as the Guarantee, (iii) the New
Commitment Letters provide for bridge financing on comparable or more
favorable terms, in the aggregate, to Buyer than the terms contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters delivered on the date hereof, (iv) Buyer in good
faith believes that the financing contemplated by the New Commitment Letters
would not or would not reasonably be expected to result in the Financing not
being available at or prior to the earlier of (A) the last day of the
Marketing Period and (B) the Final Date, and (v) Buyer provides written
notice to the Company of such an occurrence concurrently with notice of the
same to the other Equity Sponsors or Lenders, as applicable. In such event,
the terms "Commitment Letters," "Equity Commitment Letters" and
"Debt Commitment Letters" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
New Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and the term "Equity
Sponsors" as used herein shall be deemed to include any new or substitute
equity sponsors; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Commitment Letters delivered on the date hereof, the second sentence of
_Section 6.13(a)_ , and not this _Section 6.13(d)_ shall govern with
respect to the terms of any replacement financing to be obtained after any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable as described therein.

  

Section 6.14 _No Acquisition of Shares_. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, IAAI or
any Equity Sponsor shall acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of
any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that for purposes
of this _Section 6.14_ , Goldman shall not be deemed to directly or
indirectly beneficially own any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any
Affiliate of Goldman, except for controlled affiliates (as defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act)  of Goldman who have received material non-
public information about the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) this
_Section 6.14_ shall in no way limit the activities of Goldman and its
Affiliates, and (ii) Goldman and its Affiliates may engage in any brokerage,
investment advisory, financial advisory, anti-raid advisory, merger advisory,
financing, asset management, trading, market making, arbitrage, investment
activity and other similar activities conducted in the ordinary course of

efforts, to the extent requested by Buyer, to obtain and deliver to Buyer at
or prior to the Closing,

     

   

all consents, waivers, approvals and notices reasonably required under each

the Companys Disclosure Letter.

  

Section 6.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise
Buyer orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company
or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Buyer fully informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Buyer the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement
of any such stockholder litigation, shall give consideration to Buyers
advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, shall not settle any such litigation without
Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

Section 6.18 _Existing Indebtedness_. At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee under the Company Notes
Indenture sufficient immediately available funds to effect the satisfaction
and discharge of the Company Notes. The Company shall, at the request of
Buyer, take any actions reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate the
satisfaction and discharge of the Company Notes pursuant to Section 12.01 of
the Company Notes Indenture, and, subject to Buyers compliance with the
previous sentence, the Company shall satisfy and redeem such Company Notes in
accordance with the terms of the Company Notes Indenture at the Effective
Time, including the provision of instructions to the Trustee and the delivery
of an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee set
forth in Section 12.01 of the Company Notes Indenture. The Company and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other to ensure that all of the conditions to an
effective satisfaction and discharge described in Section 12.01 of the

Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company Notes Indenture.

  

Section 6.19 _Repayment and Termination of Existing Credit Facility_. The
Company shall, with immediately available funds provided by Buyer at the
Effective Time, repay in full all Indebtedness under the Credit Facility and
terminate the commitments and agreements evidencing the Credit Facility and
the Hedge Agreements. In connection therewith, Buyer shall take all actions
reasonably requested by the Company to facilitate such prepayment
and termination which actions shall include, without limitation,
the following: (a) the Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited, not
later than at the Effective Time, with the Credit Facility Agent all amounts
specified by the Credit Facility Agent as being necessary to cash
collateralize any letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility and
to prepay the Indebtedness under the Credit Facility (including any fees,
expenses, costs, commitment fees, penalties, and other amounts payable to the
Credit Facility Agent or the Credit Facility Lenders under the Credit
Facility); and (ii) the Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited, not
later than at the Effective Time, with each Hedge Agreement Counterparty all
amounts specified by such Hedge Agreement Counterparty as being necessary to
prepay the Indebtedness under the Hedge Agreement to which it is a party
(including any termination costs, fees, expenses, costs, commitment fees,
penalties, and other amounts payable to such Hedge Agreement Counterparty
under its Hedge Agreement).  Unless the Credit Facility Agent or any Hedge
Agreement Counterparty has otherwise waived or modified any notice
requirements under the Credit Facility Agreement or the Hedge Agreements (it
being understood that the Company shall request such

     

   

waivers and modifications of such notice requirements), the Company in
consultation with Buyer will provide the advance notice required under the
Credit Facility Agreement and any Hedge Agreement of its intention to repay
all Indebtedness under the Credit Facility and the Hedge Agreements and to
terminate the commitments of the Credit Facility Lenders and the Hedge
Agreement Counterparties thereunder as of the anticipated date the Effective
Date will occur, as determined by mutual agreement of the Company and Buyer,
as specified in such notice (the " _Anticipated Prepayment Date_ "). In the
event that the actual date of such repayment and termination does not occur
on the Anticipated Prepayment Date, whether as a result of any delay or
failure to occur of the Effective Date for any reason or for any other cause
whatsoever (other than as a result of actions taken or omitted to be taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in breach of this
Agreement), Buyer agrees to reimburse the Company for any actual costs or
expenses that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sustains or incurs as a
consequence of the failure of the Company to so repay such Indebtedness and
terminate such commitments on the Anticipated Prepayment Date, including any
costs and expenses charged by the Credit Facility Agent or the Credit
Facility Lenders under the Credit Agreement and any Hedge Agreement
Counterparty under a Hedge Agreement, it being understood that under no
circumstances will such amounts include actual repayment of Indebtedness
(whether through acceleration or otherwise as a result of or related to the
failure of the Company to so repay such Indebtedness and terminate such
commitments on the Anticipated Prepayment Date) (collectively, the " _Credit
Facility Fees and Expenses_ ").

  

Section 6.20 _Spin-Off Related Notice_. The Company shall promptly deliver
to Buyer, but in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt, any

Allete receives after the date hereof from any Taxing Authority regarding an
inquiry or review of the appropriateness of the Separation Tax Treatment or

remain true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving

or deviations relate to a positive difference of more than one hundred
thousand (100,000) Company Interests in the aggregate from the number of

_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ shall be disregarded for purposes of

with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the Effective Time
(other than those representations and warranties which address matters only

date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to

intentional breach of _Section 4.7_ or _Section 6.13_ ; or (C) the Company

Million Dollars ($8,000,000).

  

(iii) under circumstances in which (A) the Company is not in material breach

that (i) irreparable damage to Buyer, Holdings and Merger Sub would occur in
the event that the Company fails to consummate the

     

   

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement if the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ shall have been satisfied (or waived by the
Company), including, without limitation, Buyer, Holdings and/or Merger Sub
shall have obtained the Financing (or replacements thereof) sufficient to
