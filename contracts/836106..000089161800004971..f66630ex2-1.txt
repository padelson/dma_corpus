AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made as of October
25, 2000 (the "Execution Date") by and among NOVELLUS SYSTEMS, INC., a
California corporation ("Parent"), NEPTUNE ACQUISITION-SUB, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), and GASONICS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation ("Company").   RECITALS   A. The Boards of
Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company each have determined that the
business combination between Parent and Company through the merger of Merger
Sub with and into Company pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein (the "Merger") is in the best interests of their respective
companies, stockholders and shareholders.   B. Merger Sub is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.   C. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each
outstanding share of capital stock of Company shall be converted into a
fraction of a share of common stock of Parent, at the rate set forth
herein.   D. Company and Parent desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection
with the Merger.   E. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to
adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the
Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a)
of the Code.   F. The parties intend that, for financial accounting
purposes, the Merger shall be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.   G.
As an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain officers,
and directors of Company have concurrently herewith entered into an agreement
to vote the shares of Company\'s Capital Stock owned by such persons
to approve the Merger and this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:    
1  8   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
"Effective Time" (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Company, which shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall remain
"Globe Corporation". The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware

hereof or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Morrison and Foerster,
LLP, 755 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, or at such other location as

shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger,
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger"),
together with the required officers\' certificates, with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
Delaware Law (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware
being the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Company and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and the Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4
Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law
and such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, that as of the Effective
Time, Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended as set forth
in Exhibit A to the Certificate of Merger.   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware
Law and such Bylaws.   1.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time,
the directors of Merger Sub, serving in such capacity immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the directors of the     2  9  Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The officers of Merger Sub, holding office immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock.   (a) Certain
Definitions.   "COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK" shall mean all outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and all outstanding shares of any other capital stock of
Company as of the Effective Time.   "COMPANY COMMON STOCK" shall mean shares
of the common stock of Company, $0.001 par value.   "COMPANY ESPP" shall
mean the Company 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.   "COMPANY OPTIONS"
shall mean any and all options or other rights to purchase or otherwise
acquire shares of Company Capital Stock, whether or not presently exercisable
or subject to additional conditions prior to exercise, under and pursuant to
the (i) Company Supplemental Stock Option Plan, (ii) Company 1994 Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan, and (iii) Gamma Precision Technology 1998 Stock
Option Plan (each, a "Company Stock Option Plan," and collectively, the
"Company Stock Option Plans").   "COMPANY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES" shall mean
any and all warrants, rights or other convertible securities to purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of Company Capital Stock, whether or not presently
exercisable or subject to additional conditions prior to exercise, not
including the Company Options.   "EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean 0.52 as may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.6(e) hereof.   "PARENT COMMON STOCK" shall
mean shares of the common stock of Parent, no par value.   (b) Conversion
of Company Capital Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Company, the Merger Sub or the holders of any
of Company\'s securities, at the Effective Time, each share of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
but excluding any shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)), will
be automatically canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.6(f).     3  10   (c) Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by
Company. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are
owned by Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Capital Stock
owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company
or Parent shall be canceled and extinguished without any rights to conversion
thereof and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore. At the
Effective Time, any shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by Parent,

stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock),
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock occurring after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, so as to provide holders of
Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, like change or increase.   (f) Fractional
Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued, but in
lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the average closing price per share of Parent\'s Common Stock as
quoted on Nasdaq for the twenty (20) trading days ending on the day which is
two days before the Closing Date, less any amount required to be withheld
under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws.   (g) Capital Stock of
Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock

continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.     4  11   1.7 Surrender of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Parent\'s transfer agent,
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, shall act as the exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in the Merger.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and
Cash. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to
the Exchange Agent promptly, but in no event later than three (3) business
days after the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this Article
I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, (i) the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(b) (provided that
delivery of any shares that are subject to vesting shall be in book entry
form only until such vesting restrictions have lapsed) in exchange for shares
of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f), less any amounts required to be
withheld from such cash under foreign, federal, state or local laws.   (c)
Exchange Procedures.   (i) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause to be mailed, as soon as reasonably practical, but within ten
(10) business days, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
(the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash
in lieu of fractional shares, less any amount required to be withheld from
such cash under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws), (1) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and
(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates (or book entries in the case of shares that have
not yet vested) representing shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares, less any amount required to be withheld from such cash
under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws).   (ii) Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, (A) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate (or a book entry in the case of
shares that have not yet vested in full) representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of
Company shares represented by such certificate multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, and, if applicable, payment in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and
(B) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.   (iii) In
the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the stockholder claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue or
cause to be issued to     5  12  such Person in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, a new certificate into which the shares of
such Person\'s Company Capital Stock that are converted on the Effective Date
and/or, if applicable, deliver or cause to be delivered to such Person a
check in respect of any fractional share interests or dividends or
distributions, which such Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6(f). When authorizing such issuance in exchange therefor, Parent
and/or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to give Parent and/or the Exchange Agent a reasonable form of
bond as indemnity, as it shall direct, against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (d) Distributions With
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the Certificate representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
(but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for
shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to the Exchange Agent,
Parent or any other agent designated by Parent, as applicable, any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent, Parent or any other agent designated by Parent, as
applicable, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none
of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are     6  13  presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be exchanged and
canceled as provided in this Article I.   1.9 Tax and Accounting
Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall (a)
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code and
(b) qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling-of-interests. The parties
to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Treasury Regulations.   1.10 Withholding Rights. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and
from any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
Parent and the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.   1.11 Taking of Necessary
Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession
to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Company, the officers and directors of Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.   ARTICLE
II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   In this Agreement, any
reference to any event, change, condition or effect being "material" with
respect to any entity or group of entities means any material event, change,
condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business,
operations or results of operations of such entity and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole.   In this Agreement, any reference to a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means any change, event or effect that is materially adverse
to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including
intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations or results of
operations of Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided,
however, that none of the following shall be deemed in themselves, either
alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following shall be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) any change in the market price or
trading volume of Company\'s stock after the date hereof; (b) any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of     7  14  facts or
development to the extent attributable to the announcement or pendency of the
Merger (including any cancellation of or delays in customer orders,
any reduction in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or
similar relationships or any loss of employees); (c) any adverse change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development attributable to
conditions affecting the industries as a whole in which Company participates,
the U.S. economy as a whole or the foreign economies as a whole in any
locations where Company or any of its Subsidiaries has material operations or
sales; or (d) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts
or development arising from or relating to compliance with the terms of, or
the taking of any action required by, this Agreement.   In this Agreement,
any reference to a party\'s "knowledge" means actual knowledge of such
party\'s officers and directors, provided that officers shall have made
reasonable due and diligent inquiry of those employees of such party whom
such officers reasonably believe would have actual knowledge of the
matters represented.   In this Agreement, any reference to a party
conducting its business or other affairs or taking any action in the
"ordinary course of business" means that such an action taken by or on behalf
of such party shall not be deemed to have been taken in the "ordinary course
of business" unless such action is taken in the ordinary course of such
party\'s normal day to day operations and is similar in nature and magnitude
to actions customarily taken, without any separate or special
authorization.   Except as disclosed in a document of even date herewith and
attached to this Agreement and delivered by Company to Parent prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and referring by section number to
the representations and warranties in this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), provided that any disclosure shall qualify the
disclosure under the section number referred to in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as well as all other sections in this Agreement, when it is
reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies
or applies to such other sections, provided further that Company shall make
all reasonable efforts to specifically cross reference in the Company
Disclosure Schedule all sections where a particular disclosure qualifies or
applies, Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:   2.1
Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Company and its
subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Company has delivered
or made available a true and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws or other charter documents, as applicable, of Company and each of
its subsidiaries, each as amended to date, to Parent. Neither Company nor any
of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents. Company is the owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
each of its subsidiaries and all such shares are duly authorized, validly
issued,     8  15  fully paid and nonassessable. Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 2.4 hereof), Company does
not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded
company held for investment by Company or any of it subsidiaries in
accordance with and pursuant to the Company\'s formal investment policy and
comprising less than 5% of the outstanding stock of such company.   2.2
Capital Structure.   (a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists

any fiduciary has any knowledge of any facts that could give rise to any such
action or claim; and (iv) it provides that it may be amended or terminated at

permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC). The Parent Financial Statements fairly
present the consolidated financial condition and operating results of Parent
as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case

Tax Matters. To Parent\'s knowledge neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates

capacities as such). There is no judgment, decree or order against Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of Parent, or any of its

provided by Parent (including any information previously provided by Parent
in the Parent SEC Documents) for inclusion in the Registration Statement
shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by
the SEC and at all times subsequent thereto (through and including the

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The information relating to Parent
which is provided by Parent (including any information previously provided by
Parent in the Parent SEC Documents) for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
stockholders of Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and

necessary to correct any statement in an earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has

representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied
by Company or relating to Company which is contained in the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement.   3.10 Opinion of Financial Advisor.

Affiliates and, to the extent Parent deemed appropriate, by
Parent\'s representatives. Parent acknowledges that it and its
representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as Parent has requested for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
Parent acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned
investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or

specific representations and warranties of Company set forth in this
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedules). Parent has formed an
independent judgment concerning the Company.   3.12 Absence of Certain
Changes. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents prior to the date
hereof or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since the Parent
Balance Sheet Date there has not occurred any change, event or condition

that has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   ARTICLE IV   CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE
TIME   4.1 Conduct of Business of Company. During the period from the date

any event which could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   4.2 Restriction on Conduct of Business of Company. During

Takeover Proposal; provided, nothing herein shall prohibit Company\'s Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer.     35  42  
(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.3(a) above, if an unsolicited written Takeover
Proposal, or an unsolicited written expression of interest that can

by the Board of Directors of Company, then (i) if none of Company,
its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees or
other agents and representatives have violated any of the restrictions in
this Section 4.3(a), and (ii) to the extent the Board of Directors of Company
believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that
such Takeover Proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more
favorable to Company\'s stockholders than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (any such more favorable Takeover Proposal being referred to
in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"), and (iii) the Board of Directors
of Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to take action with respect to such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Company to Company stockholders under applicable law, Company and its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives retained by it may furnish
in connection with such a Superior Proposal information and take such other
actions with respect to such Superior Proposal as are consistent with the
fiduciary obligations of Company\'s Board of Directors, and such actions with
respect to such Superior Proposal shall not be considered a breach of Section
4.3(a), provided that in each such event Company (A) notifies Parent in
writing of such determination by the Company Board of Directors, (B) provides
Parent with a summary of the Superior Proposal received from such third party
so long as such disclosure does not cause the breach of any non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreements of Company outstanding as of the Execution Date,
and (C) informs Parent of all documents containing or referring to non-public
information of Company that are supplied to such third party so long as such
disclosure does not cause the breach of any non-disclosure or confidentiality
agreements of Company outstanding as of the Execution Date. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, neither Company nor its representatives
may take any action with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (x) the Board
of Directors of Company has determined, with the advice of Company\'s
investment bankers, that such third party is actually capable of making a
Superior Proposal upon satisfactory completion of such third party\'s review
of the information supplied by Company, (y) the third party has stated that
it intends to make a Superior Proposal, and (z) Company provides such non-
public information to such third party pursuant to a non-disclosure
or confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4). Additionally Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its officers, directors, employees or
other representatives to agree to or intentionally endorse any Takeover
Proposal (including any Superior Proposal) unless Parent or Company shall
have terminated this Agreement and Company shall have paid to Parent all
amounts payable to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b).   (c) Company will
promptly notify Parent after receipt, but in no event later than 24 hours
from such receipt, of any Takeover Proposal or any notice that any Person is
considering making a Takeover Proposal or any request for non-public
information relating to Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to
the properties, books or records of Company or any of its subsidiaries by any
Person that has advised Company that it may be considering making, or that
has made, a Takeover Proposal and will keep Parent fully informed of
the status     36  43  of any such Takeover Proposal notice or request
and shall provide Parent with a true summary of such Takeover Proposal notice
or request.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal"
means any offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest in (whether
written or oral), a merger or other business combination involving Company or
any of its subsidiaries or the acquisition of any significant equity interest
(30%) in, or a significant portion of the assets (30% or more on a
consolidated basis) of, Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS   5.1 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement.
Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Company and Parent shall
prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 (or such other form or successor form as shall be appropriate), which
complies in form with applicable SEC requirements and shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as
soon thereafter as practicable; provided, however, that Parent shall have no
obligation to agree to account for the Merger as a "purchase" in order to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective. If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, any event or information should be discovered by
Company which should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration
Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Company shall promptly
inform Parent. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Proxy Statement
shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company that
the Company stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and approve this
Agreement; provided that such recommendation may not be included or may
be withdrawn if previously included if (i) none of Company, its subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors, employees or other agents
and representatives violated any of the restrictions in Section 4.3(a)
hereof, (ii) Company\'s Board of Directors believes in good faith that a
Superior Proposal has been made, and (iii) following consultation with
outside legal counsel, Company\'s Board of Directors determines that the
inclusion of such recommendation or the failure to withdraw such
recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of Company to the stockholders of Company under applicable
laws.   5.2 Meeting of Stockholders. Company shall promptly after the
date hereof take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within forty-five (45) days of the Registration Statement being
declared effective by the SEC. Company shall give Parent no less than ten
(10) business days advance notice of the date which shall be set as the
"record date" for the Company Stockholders eligible to vote on this Agreement
and the Merger. Company shall also consult with Parent regarding the date of
the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn (other
than for the absence of a quorum) the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the consent of Parent unless this Agreement is first terminated by Company
pursuant to Article VII     37  44  hereof. Subject to Sections 4.3 and
5.1, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
stockholders of Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all

applicable law to effect the Merger.   5.3 Access to Information; Disclosure
Schedule Updates.   (a) Upon reasonable notice, Company shall afford Parent
and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or

operation of Company and provided further that Parent contacts Company\'s
Chief Financial Officer prior to contacting any other employee of Company, to
(i) all of Company\'s properties, books, contracts, commitments and records,
and (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of Company as Parent may reasonably request. Company agrees to
provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
copies of internal financial statements promptly upon request.   (b)
Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the date hereof until the
Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Company and Parent shall confer on a regular and frequent
basis to report operational matters of materiality and the general status of
ongoing operations of Company.   (c) No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation after the Execution Date pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger;
provided, however that Company shall promptly inform Parent of any such
information or knowledge obtained in its investigation which would reasonably
be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Additionally, during the
period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Company shall
promptly notify Parent in writing of:   (i) the discovery of any event,
condition, fact or circumstance which causes, caused, constitutes or
constituted a breach of any representation or warranty made by Company in
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby to the extent that
such event, condition, fact or circumstance would cause the condition in
Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement not to be satisfied;   (ii) any material
breach of any covenant or obligation by Company; and   (iii) any event,
condition, fact or circumstance that may make the timely satisfaction of any
of the covenants or conditions set forth in this Article V or Article VI
impossible or unlikely.     38  45   (d) If any event, condition, fact
or circumstances that is required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(c)
requires any material change in Company\'s Disclosure Schedule, or if any
such event, condition, fact or circumstance would require such a change
assuming Company\'s Disclosure Schedule were dated as of the date of the
occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or
circumstances, then Company shall promptly deliver to Parent an update to its
Disclosure Schedule specifying such change (a "Disclosure Schedule Update").
Notwithstanding anything therein to the contrary, no such update shall be
deemed to supplement or amend Company\'s Disclosure Schedule for the purpose
of (A) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties
made by such party in this Agreement, or (B) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Article VI has been satisfied.   (e) Company shall
provide Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all of Company\'s Tax Returns and other records and
workpapers relating to Taxes, provided that such access does not cause
disruption to the day-to-day operation of Company and provided further that

any other employee of Company, and shall provide to Parent and its
representatives the following information promptly upon the request of
Parent: (i) the types of Tax Returns being filed by Company in each taxing
jurisdiction, (ii) the year of the commencement of the filing of each such
type of Tax Return, (iii) all closed years with respect to each such type of
Tax Return filed in each jurisdiction, (iv) all material Tax elections filed

consents, waivers and approvals under any of their respective material
contracts in connection with the     39  46  Merger for the assignment
thereof or otherwise. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection

other transactions, unless by mutual agreement Parent and Company decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the

Time, and (ii) Company and its subsidiaries shall not be required to divest
any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or
agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation where such

efforts to furnish Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, with evidence
satisfactory to it of the consent or approval of those Persons whose consent
or approval shall be required in connection with the Merger under the
contracts of Company set forth, or required to be set forth, on Schedule

FIRPTA. Company shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent with a
properly executed FIRPTA Notification Letter, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E, which states that shares of capital stock
of Company do not constitute "United States real property interests" under
Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Parent\'s obligations

with delivery of such Notification Letter, Company shall have provided to

1.897-2(h)(2) and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F,
along with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to
the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Company upon the Closing of the
Merger.   5.10 Legal Requirements. Each of Parent and, subject to Sections
4.3 and 5.1 of this Agreement, Company, shall take all reasonable actions
necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
on them with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to
any party hereto necessary in connection with any such requirements imposed
upon such other party in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will take all reasonable actions necessary
to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) any
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or any     41 
48  registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or
other Person, required to be obtained or made in connection with the taking
of any action contemplated by this Agreement.   5.11 Employee Benefit
Plans.   (a) Assumption of Company Options. At the Effective Time,
the Company Stock Option Plans will be assumed by Parent and each
outstanding Company Option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
the Company Stock Option Plans, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed
by Parent and converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock (each a "Parent Option"). Schedule 5.11(a) hereto sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding Company
Options under each of the Company Stock Option Plans, including the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or
vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such
option. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated
Schedule 5.11(a) hereto current as of such date. Except as provided below,
each such Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall
retain its respective vesting schedule under the applicable Company Stock
Option Plan and its respective stock option agreement and each such Company
Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable Company Stock Option Plan, except that (i) each such option
will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
would be issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, assuming that all vesting conditions applicable to such
option were then satisfied, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent. Consistent
with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the documents governing
the outstanding Company Options under such plans, the Merger will not
terminate any of the outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock
Option Plans or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options or
the shares of Parent Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon
the assumption of the Company Options in connection with the Merger. It is
the intention of the parties that the Company Options assumed by Parent
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, as
incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the
extent, and only to the extent, the Company Options so replaced qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts, within thirty (30) days after the Form S-8 filed
pursuant to Section 5.13 hereof is declared effective, to issue to each
Person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an
outstanding Company Option, a copy of the effective Form S-8 and such other
documents as are reasonably advisable, as evidence of the foregoing
assumption of such Company Options by Parent. The Company Board of Directors
shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of
the Effective Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the deemed disposition and cancellation of the Company Options in the
Merger. Provided that Company shall first provide to Parent the names of
its stockholders and the number of shares of Company Capital Stock or    
42  49  Company Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act and any other information reasonable requested by Parent and
relating to the same, the Board of Directors of Parent shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed grant of options to purchase Parent
Common Stock under the Company Options (as assumed pursuant to this Section
5.11(a)). As of or prior to the Effective Time, the disposition of shares of
Company Common Stock by the Company executive officers and Board members and
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to such persons in the Merger
shall also be included in the approval process of the Boards of Directors of
Company and Parent for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.   (b)
Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause all
outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP to be exercised upon the
earlier of (i) the next scheduled purchase date under the Company ESPP, or
(ii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each participant in
the Company ESPP shall accordingly be issued shares of Company Common Stock
at that time which shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger. The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the
Company ESPP as of such exercise date, and no purchase rights shall be
subsequently granted or exercised under the Company ESPP. Employees of
Company and other Members of the Controlled Group who become employees of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be permitted
to participate in the Parent ESPP commencing on the first enrollment date
following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with the eligibility
provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for purposes of
such eligibility provisions, for service with the Company or any other Member
of the Controlled Group to the extent permitted by applicable law and
applicable tax qualification requirements).   (c) Termination of Employee
Plans. If requested by Parent, Company shall, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, terminate the Company Plans and no further contributions shall
be made to the Company Plans, provided that, as conditions of such
termination, (i) Company\'s employees who become employees of Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation shall receive employee benefits which in the
aggregate are no less favorable than those provided from time to time by
Parent and its subsidiaries to their respective similarly situated employees;
and (ii) Company\'s employees shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s
401(k) plan immediately following the Closing Date, subject to compliance
with the eligibility provisions of such plan. Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided that under each employee
benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement where service is relevant to a
determination of an employee\'s eligibility to participate, vesting, or level
or amount of benefits, employees of Company who become employees of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be credited with their period of
service with Company prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, and subject to
any generally applicable break in service or similar rules. Subject to the
approval of any insurance carrier and to the extent consistent
with applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall make available, or cause to be made
available, to those employees of Company who become employees of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, medical, dental, disability and other
welfare benefits plans and programs, to the extent the same is offered by
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation generally to their     43 
50  respective employees, without regard to any preexisting condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation, provided, and
only to the extent, that any analogous restriction applied to such employee
under an analogous plan of Company had been satisfied as of the Closing Date.
In determining an employee\'s share of the cost of coverage under any plan
or program of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for the year in which
the Closing occurs, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any pre-Closing
co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each
comparable plan maintained by Company prior to the Effective Time for such
year. Parent shall not be required to have any preexisting condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation waived or to
credit any pre-Closing co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such
employee unless Company (or its successor entity) or the applicable insurance
carrier makes available a HIPAA Certificate evidencing prior coverage under
the corresponding or analogous Company plan. Company shall provide to Parent
(i) executed resolutions by the Board of Directors of Company authorizing the
termination and (ii) an executed amendment to the Plans sufficient to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations
thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the Plan will be maintained at
the time of termination.   5.12 Indemnification.   (a) For not less than
(i) six (6) years, in the case of acts or omissions under or pursuant to
Section 174 of the Delaware Law and Section 8109 of Title 10 of the Delaware
Code Annotated, and (ii) four (4) years, for all other acts or omissions,
after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers,
directors, employees and agents of Company (the "Indemnified Parties") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
to the extent provided for under Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws and each indemnification agreement with Company officers and directors
to which Company is a party, in each case in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing,
in the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any
capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any
matter relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay as incurred such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable legal and
other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation)
incurred in connection therewith.   (b) For (i) six (6) years, in the case
of acts or omissions under or pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware Law and
Section 8109 of Title 10 of the Delaware Code Annotated, and (ii) four (4)
years, for all other acts or omissions after the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its best efforts to provide
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Person currently covered by Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policy on terms at least as favorable as the coverage currently in
effect on the date hereof, provided that in satisfying its obligation under
this Section 5.12(b), Parent shall not     44  51  be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay premiums in excess of 150% of the
amount per annum Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has
been disclosed to Parent and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain
the insurance required by this Section 5.12(b), it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum
amount.   (c) For a period of (i) six (6) years, in the case of acts
or omissions under or pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware Law and Section
8109 of Title 10 of the Delaware Code Annotated, and (ii) four (4) years, for
all other acts or omissions, after the Effective Time, to the extent there is
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether commencing
before or after the Effective Time) against or involving any Indemnified
Party that arises out of or pertains to any action or omission (or alleged
action or omission) in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee,
or agent of Company which act omission occurred prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide legal
counsel and to defend such Indemnified Party and to pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided, further,
that, in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted
or made within such four-year or six-year period, as applicable, all rights
to indemnification in respect to any such claim or claims shall continue
until the final disposition of any and all such claims.   (d) Parent shall
pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred
by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this Section 5.12 to the extent that such Indemnified Party
is determined to be entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.12.  
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives.   5.13 Form S-8. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Company Options assumed in
accordance with Section 5.11(a). As soon as practicable and in no event more
than twenty (20) days after the Closing, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such options or on
another appropriate form of registration statement for any such shares of
Parent Common Stock which are not registrable on Form S-8 and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding. Company will cooperate and assist Parent in the
preparation of such registration statement(s).   5.14 NASDAQ Quotation.
Parent and Company agree to continue the quotation of Parent Common Stock and
Company Common Stock, respectively, on the Nasdaq     45  52  National
Market during the term of the Agreement so that, to the extent necessary,
appraisal rights will not be available to the stockholders of Company under
Section 262 of the Delaware Law.   5.15 Treatment as Reorganization. Neither
Company nor Parent shall take any action prior to or following the Closing
that would cause the merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Company and Parent shall cooperate
in obtaining the opinions referred to in Section 6.1(e) hereof, including
providing counsel with the representation letters also described in Section
6.1(e).   5.16 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute shall become
applicable to the transaction contemplated hereby, Company and the members of
the Board of Directors of Company shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be commenced as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation in the transaction contemplated hereby, except, in each such
case, to the extent required in the exercise of the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of Company under applicable law as advised by independent
counsel.   5.17 Pooling Accounting. Parent and Company shall each use
reasonable efforts to cause the business combination to be effected by the
Merger to be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Each of Parent and
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its "Affiliates" (as
defined in Section 5.7) not to take any action that would adversely affect
the ability of Parent to account for the business combination to be effected
by the Merger as a pooling-of-interests.   5.18 Pooling Letters.   (a)
Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a
letter of Ernst and Young LLP, Parent\'s independent accountants, dated the
Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger qualifies for pooling-of-
interests accounting treatment, if consummated in accordance with this
Agreement. Such letter shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to

independent public accountants in connection with transactions of this type.
Company shall provide appropriate representations to Ernst and Young LLP as
reasonably requested by Ernst and Young LLP, customary in scope and substance
for such letters.   (b) Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to

execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts
and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
5.22 Rights Agreement. If Company, after the date hereof, adopts
or implements any stockholder rights agreement or plan (the "Company
Rights Agreement"), Company shall take all necessary or advisable action to
ensure that neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
performance by the respective parties hereto of their obligations hereunder
will give rise to a "stock acquisition date" or "distribution date" or
constitute Parent or Merger Sub an "acquiring person," or like terms as
defined in any such Company Rights Agreement. Company shall take any further
action necessary prior to the Effective Time to cause the dilutive provisions
of any such Company Rights Agreement to be inapplicable to the Merger,
without any payment to holders of rights issued under any such Company Rights
Agreement.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   No party may refuse

obtained from each Governmental Entity all approvals, waivers and consents,
