vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November 8,
2012, among SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED, a corporation organized
under the laws of India (" _Parent_ "), Caraco Acquisition Corporation, a New
Jersey corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), and DUSA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a New Jersey corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto.

Recitals

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Transactions, (a) Parent has agreed to cause
Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the
issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, no par value per share (the
" _Company Common Stock_ ") of the Company (each a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $8.00 net to the
seller in cash, without interest (such amount, or any higher amount per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and (b) the Company has granted to Merger Sub the Top-Up Option;

 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as
an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the New
Jersey Business Corporation Act (the " _NJBCA_ "). Each Share that is not
tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as
provided in Section 2.5(b) and 2.9, will thereupon be cancelled and converted
in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
officers and directors of the Company holding Company Common Stock have
entered into a Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, each
such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to tender his or its Shares in
the Offer.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



1 ARTICLE 1.

THE OFFER

_Section 1.1._ _The Offer_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, provided
that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article
8 and none of the events set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Annex A hereto
shall have occurred, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) commence the Offer, within the meaning of the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price
per Share equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase, accept for payment, and pay for,
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the " _Offer
Conditions_ ").

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be on the date that is the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer
(determined using Exchange Act Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2) (such date being
the initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date
established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer as so extended,
also an " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the
Offer is terminated in accordance with _Article 8_ , if, on the initial
Expiration Date or any subsequent Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions
have not been satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, subject to the rights of the parties under Article 8,
extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its Expiration Date beyond the initial
Expiration Date or such subsequent Expiration Date; _provided_ that any such
extension shall be in increments determined by Merger Sub of not more than ten
(10) Business Days. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its Expiration
Date (as such Expiration Date may be extended and re-extended in accordance
with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article 8. In no event shall Merger Sub extend the Offer
beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Walk Away Date
without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the rights of the parties under
Article 8, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to extend the Offer, for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer or any period required by any other Law.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, comply with the obligations respecting prompt
payment and announcement under the Exchange Act, and, without limiting the
foregoing, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable following the later of: (i)
the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest
date as of which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived.

 



2 (d) Merger Sub may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent
offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ")
following the Acceptance Time if (i) Merger Sub shall have complied with all
of the conditions of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act and (ii) at the
commencement of any Subsequent Offering Period (or extension thereof) the
number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries
(including any Shares beneficially owned by any of the foregoing, including
all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at the Acceptance Time)
represent less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares on a Fully
Diluted Basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Merger Sub is required to
exercise the Top-Up Option and the Company delivers the Top-Up Option Shares
upon such exercise pursuant to Section 1.4(c), Merger Sub shall not be
permitted to provide for a Subsequent Offering Period. If
immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries own more than 70% but less than 90% of the Shares
outstanding on a Fully-Diluted Basis at that time (which shall include (i)
Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries, which Shares shall be converted into direct ownership at or
prior to the expiration of the Offer by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (ii) Shares validly tendered in the
Offer and not properly withdrawn at the Acceptance Time), upon the request of
the Company (which may only be made once), Merger Sub shall provide for, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to provide for, a Subsequent Offering Period of
at least ten (10) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Merger Sub
is required to exercise the Top-Up Option and the Company delivers the Top-Up
Option Shares upon such exercise pursuant to Section 1.4(c), the Company
shall not have the right to request Merger Sub to provide for a Subsequent
Offering Period. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub
shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as promptly as
practicable after any such Shares are tendered during any Subsequent Offering
Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11(c) promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of
the Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price and/or to modify the other
terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, do
any of the following: 

(i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer;

 

(ii) reduce the Offer Price;

(iii) amend, change or waive the Minimum Tender Condition;

(iv) except as expressly provided in Section 1.1(b), extend or otherwise
change the Expiration Date, except (A) as required by applicable Law
(including for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof) or (B) in connection with an
increase of the Offer Price;

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

 



3 (vi) impose any condition to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions; or

 

(vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the
terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of Shares or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or
impair the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or the Transactions.

(f) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall (i) contain or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement and such other information or documents as required by Law
(such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the
Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, being
referred to as the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) be in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. The Company shall as promptly as practicable upon
request of Parent, provide Parent and Merger Sub with all information
concerning the Company that is required to be included in the Offer
Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to comply in
all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on the
date first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, not to contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to information supplied by the Company in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent necessary
such that the Offer Documents do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Offer Documents each time before they are filed with the
SEC and/or disseminated to holders of Shares (and the Company and its counsel
shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel). Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide to the Company and its counsel copies of any written comments or
telephonic notification of any oral comments or other communications Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or other
communications, shall consult with the Company and its counsel prior to
responding to any such comments or other communications, and shall provide the
Company with copies of all written responses and telephonic notification of
any oral responses thereto of Parent or Merger Sub or their counsel,
_provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response 

 



4  of Parent and Merger Sub to any such comments or other communications and to

consideration shall be given by Parent and Merger Sub).

(g) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer without the prior
written consent of the Company in its sole discretion. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1A, Merger Sub shall promptly
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) following such termination
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any
Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this
Agreement prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall
promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock effected by the Company in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and, in particular, in accordance with

a record date is established) after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the payment by Merger Sub for the Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn in connection with the Offer.

(a) Subject to Section 6.8, and without limitation of the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ").

(b) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect
to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended and supplemented from time to
time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14D-9

inclusion in the Offer Documents of such recommendation. The Schedule 14D-9
shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to the Companys shareholders, shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that the Company makes no covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent necessary
such that

 



5  the Schedule 14D-9 does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities Laws.

 

(c) Except in connection with either (i) a Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company and/or a special committee of the Board (the "
_Company Board_ ") determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel and financial advisor(s)) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal or (ii) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, in each case subject to the provisions of Section 6.8:

(A) Parent and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares; and

(B) The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel copies of any written
comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments or other
communications the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments or other communications, shall consult with Parent and its counsel
prior to responding to any such comments or other communications, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all written responses and telephonic
notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company and its counsel.

such responses and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel prior to the
submission of any such responses.

addresses of the record holders of Shares as of a recent date and of those
Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies
of all available lists of shareholders, security position listings
and computer files and all other information in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to Merger
Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of shareholders,
security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably
request, in each case, for the sole purpose of communicating the Offer to the
holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall, until consummation of the Offer,
hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 8.1,
shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.

 



6 _Section 1.3._ _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and applicable marketplace rules of The NASDAQ
Stock Market LLC applicable to the Company at such time, promptly following
the acceptance for payment of and payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to
and in accordance with the Offer satisfying the Minimum Tender Condition (the
" _Acceptance Time_ "), and as long as Parent directly or indirectly
beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding
Shares, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on
the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board
equal to that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that
is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied
by (ii) the percentage that (A) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of Shares
that are issued and outstanding (not determined on a Fully Diluted Basis). The
Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause such Persons designated
by Merger Sub to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the
next whole number) as is on the Company Board of each committee of the Company
Board, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws and the
marketplace rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (other than any committee
comprised solely of Continuing Directors established to take action under this
Agreement, which shall be permitted to meet without the presence of other
directors solely for purposes of considering and, if necessary, taking action
referred to in Section 1.3(c) below); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that Merger Subs designees are appointed or elected to the Company
Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two (2)
directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who qualify as
independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of
The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the SEC rules and regulations (such directors,
the " _Continuing Directors_ "); and _provided_ _further_ that, in such event,
if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any
reason whatsoever, the Company Board shall cause the Person(s) designated by
the remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies), and such
Person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s) for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall designate two (2) Persons to
fill such vacancies who are not officers, employees, shareholders or
Affiliates of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of
Parent, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company
shall either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the irrevocable
resignation of such number of its current directors, or both, as is necessary
to enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board as provided above, and the Company shall take all actions available
to the Company to cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected or appointed
(the date on which the majority of the Companys directors are designees of
Merger Sub that have been effectively appointed to the Company Board in
accordance herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Board Appointment Date to be the same
day as the Acceptance Time. Upon request by Parent, prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall obtain the applicable irrevocable resignations from
that number of directors which represents one (1) director more than a simple
majority of the Company Board, which resignations will each be contingent
solely upon the consummation of the Offer, and the Company shall provide to
Parent complete and correct copies of such resignations promptly (and in no
event later than two (2) Business Days) following the request therefor. The
parties hereto 

 



7  acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Acceptance Time and for so
long as Parent, Merger Sub and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub
(excluding the Company) own at least a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock, the Company shall be a "controlled
company" (within the meaning of the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global
Market).

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees of Merger Sub to the
Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-l promulgated thereunder and to the then applicable rules and regulations
of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The Company, at its expense, shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to the
Companys shareholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9, as
contemplated by Section 1.2(b)) as is necessary to fulfill the Companys
obligations under Section 1.3(a); _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall have timely supplied to the Company in writing, and shall be
solely responsible for, any information with respect to Parent, Merger Sub
and their designees, officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required
by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a
holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates take any action
prior to the Effective Time to remove any Continuing Director from the Company
Board other than for cause.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by a majority
of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one or
two Continuing Directors then in office, all of such Continuing Directors then
in office) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall (A)
not be effective unless there is in office at least one (1) Continuing
Director and (B) constitute the authorization of the Company Board, and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
committee thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless
otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any
amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii)
any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder
by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Companys
rights under this Agreement, (iv) any waiver of any condition to the Companys
obligations hereunder, (v) any amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, (vi) any authorization of any agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
on the other hand, or (vii) the taking of any other action by the Company
other than what has been agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
the Transactions. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain
such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other
advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of
the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Companys
rights hereunder.

 



8 (d) The rights of Parent pursuant to this Section 1.3 are in addition to, and
shall not limit, any right that Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent
or Merger Sub may have (with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise) under applicable Law, the Companys certificate of incorporation or
otherwise as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

_Section 1.4._ _Option to Acquire Additional Shares_. 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable in accordance with this Section 1.4, to purchase
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned in the aggregate by Parent,
Merger Sub and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option (including all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn in the Offer at the Acceptance Time), shall constitute one
share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis and (after giving effect to the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares) for a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share
equal to the Offer Price. The Top-Up Option shall only be exercised one time
by Merger Sub in whole but not in part. For avoidance of doubt, (i) the one
time exercise means an exercise pursuant to which Top-Up Shares are actually
delivered by Company to Merger Sub and (ii) all or any portion of the 60
Million Shares (less the 40,000 shares designated as Company Preferred Stock)
issued to Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be designated
Company Common Stock.

(b) In no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares
of Company Common Stock in excess of the Companys then authorized and
unissued shares of Company Common Stock (including the 60 Million Shares
designated as Company Common Stock and less any required shares to be held in
reserve with respect to the Options, Restricted Shares and Warrants and
including as authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock, for
purposes of this Section 1.4, any shares of Company Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company).

 

(c) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Sub (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option) immediately after the Acceptance
Time or the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period, as applicable, if
(i) at the Acceptance Time or expiration of a Subsequent Offering Period, as
applicable, Parent, Merger Sub and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub do
not own in the aggregate at least 90% of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis and (ii) after giving
effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, and taking into account the
limitations set forth in Section 1.4(b), Parent, Merger Sub and any
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub would own in the aggregate at least one
share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (after giving effect to the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the
Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option
is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (A) no
provision of any applicable Law, and no temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other Judgment or order issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery
of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned 

 



9  in the aggregate by Parent, Merger Sub and any Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding (on a Fully Diluted
Basis) immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (C) Merger
Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer (including, if applicable, during a Subsequent Offering Period) and not
properly withdrawn, and (D) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent
covenants to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; and, _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with any termination of this
Agreement.

(d) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Law,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the
Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub is required to
exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice
thereof (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") specifying (i) a place and time for the
closing of such purchase (which, subject to applicable Law and any required
regulatory approvals, shall be effected as promptly as practicable and not
more than one (1) Business Day after the date of delivery of such Top-Up
Notice), (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will
constitute the Top-Up Option Shares and (iii) the manner in which Parent or
Merger Sub shall pay the applicable purchase price in respect of the Top-Up
Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
(A) the purchase price in respect of the Top-Up Option Shares purchased upon
such exercise of the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the product of (x) the
number of Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up
Option and (y) the Offer Price) shall be paid to the Company, at Merger Subs
election, either (I) in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Company or (II) by delivering Parents
unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory note in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (the " _Promissory Note_ ") in the principal
amount equal to the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares, and (B) the
Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates
representing the number of Top-Up Option Shares so purchased. The Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that upon delivery to Merger
Sub of the Top-Up Option Shares against payment therefor in accordance
herewith, such Top-Up Option Shares shall be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Company Common Stock.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger
Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company
that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act or a sophisticated purchaser under Section 4(2) under the
Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares shall
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 



10 (f) To the extent applicable, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge
and agree that neither any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares of
Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, nor any
effect of any Promissory Note delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company
as the Top-Up consideration, shall be taken into account in any determination
of the fair value of Shares of any shareholder of the Company for any reason
whatsoever or with respect to Shares of any dissenting shareholder to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Surviving Corporation shall
not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares or any cash or Promissory
Note delivered to the Company as payment for any Top-Up Shares should be
considered in the connection with the determination of the fair value of any
Shares for any purpose whatsoever.

ARTICLE 2.

 

THE MERGER

 

 _Section 2.1._ _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in compliance with the NJBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.
For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the corporation surviving the Merger

_Section 2.2._ _Merger Closing_.

(a) The Merger shall be consummated (the " _Closing_ ") at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern
time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than
the third (3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than
any such conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Reed Smith
LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date upon which the
Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

(b) At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by causing to be filed with the Department of Treasury of the
State of New Jersey a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),
in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the NJBCA and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the NJBCA. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Department of Treasury of
the State of New Jersey, or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries collectively hold or acquire at
least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock after giving
effect to the closing of the Offer

 



11  and, if applicable, the purchase by Merger Sub of the Top-Up Shares, Parent
and the Company hereby agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective, without a meeting of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 14A:10-5.1 of the
NJBCA as promptly as practicable.

_Section 2.3._ _Effect of Merger; Organizational Documents; Directors and
Officers_.

14A:10-6 of the NJBCA.

(b) The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall at the
Effective Time be amended in its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit B,
until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the NJBCA. In
addition, subject to Section 6.9 hereof, Parent shall cause the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that,
immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
all references to the name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to
the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance
with the NJBCA. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall
serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 _Section 2.4._ _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock,
each share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

_Section 2.5._ _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of Shares the following shall occur:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(b)) shall at
the Effective Time be canceled and converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.6, without interest.

 



12 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
automatically and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

(c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established)
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time effected by the Company
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and, in
particular, in accordance with the limitations set forth in Section
5.1(b)(vi). 

_Section 2.6._ _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Companys transfer agent or another bank or trust company
selected by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Article 2. Parent shall, or shall take all steps
necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange Agent
at or prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash in U.S. dollars
necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to
such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent;
_provided further_ ,  _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Shares following the Effective Time and
Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund
includes at all times cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to satisfy Parents
obligation under this Article 2. Any interest or income produced (net of any
loss) by such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to
Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. In the event of any losses to the
Exchange Fund from any investment such that the Exchange Fund is diminished
below the level required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash payments
as required under Section 2.7(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into the
Exchange Fund to the extent necessary to reimburse the Exchange Fund for any
such investment losses.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5,
(i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of
stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by
Book-Entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall be in
customary form approved by the Company and shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering

 



13  the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
paid promptly (net of applicable taxes in accordance with Section 2.8) in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to such
holder (except holders of Restricted Shares who shall be paid as set forth in
Section 2.7(d)), the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.6
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by

that do not materially detract from the value or use of such Leased Real
Property (collectively, the " _Permitted Encumbrances_ ").

(c) All of the Leased Real Property has such access to, and such use of, gas,
electricity and other utility services, as are necessary in the conduct of the
business of the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary as presently
conducted, directly or through a valid easement or right of way which is
leased or owned by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, except where the
failure to have any such access, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be likely to be material to the operations conducted at such Leased
Real Property.

(d) All buildings, structures, fixtures, building systems and equipment
included in the Leased Real Property (the " _Structures_ ") are in good
condition and repair and sufficient for the operation of the business of the
Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary as presently conducted, except
where the failure of the foregoing to be true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



33 (e) Except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Leases and this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
obligated under any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right
to sell, dispose of or lease any of the Leased Real Property or any portion
thereof to any Person, except for such options, rights of first refusal or
other contractual right to sell, dispose of or lease any of the Leased Real
Property or any portion thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or option to
purchase any real property other than the Leased Real Property or interest
therein.

(f) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received any written notices regarding any pending, threatened or contemplated
condemnation proceeding affecting the Leased Real Property or any part thereof
or of any sale or other disposition of the Leased Real Property or any part
thereof in lieu of condemnation or other matters materially affecting and
impairing the current use, occupancy, or value thereof.

 

 _Section 3.20._ _Antitakeover Statute_. The Company has taken all actions so
that the restrictions contained in Section 14A of the NJBCA applicable to a
"business combination" with "interested shareholders" (as defined in Section
14A:10A-3 of the NJBCA) or any other similar Law will not apply to (a) Parent
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (b) the
consummation of the Merger and the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No anti-takeover provision contained in the Company Charter
Documents is applicable to the Merger and no anti-takeover provision, whether
in a Law, agreement or otherwise is, or would be, applicable to this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _Section 3.21._ _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Article 3, neither
the Company nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or its business,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise)
or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any
documentation, forecasts or other information with respect to any one or more
of the foregoing, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge the
foregoing.

to the Knowledge of Parent, that materially affects the assets of Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, except, individually or in the
aggregate, as have not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent

Judgments that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking
full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including

ARTICLE 6.

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

_Section 6.1._ _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meetings_.

(a) After the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any Subsequent Offering
Period, if Parent does not then beneficially own sufficient Shares on a Fully
Diluted Basis to effect a merger not requiring the approval of the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to the NJBCA, the Company shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all material
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide reasonable comments on the Proxy Statement,
if a Company Shareholders Meeting is required, prior to its being filed with
the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and provide reasonable comments on all amendments and supplements to
the Proxy Statement, if a Company Shareholders Meeting is required, and all
responses to requests for additional information and

 



41  replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. If
at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Shareholder Vote there
shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
shareholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares as
promptly as reasonably practicable after filing the Proxy Statement with the
SEC and resolution of any comments thereon from and clearance by the SEC or
its staff.

(b) After the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any Subsequent Offering
Period, if Parent does not then beneficially own sufficient Shares on a Fully
Diluted to effect a merger not requiring the approval of the shareholders of
the Company pursuant to the NJBCA, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose
of seeking the Required Company Shareholder Vote. The Company Board shall
recommend adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Voting Proposal_ ") by
the shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company
shareholders.

(c) At the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent shall cause all Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary, and shall use its best efforts
to cause any Shares beneficially owned by any non-controlled Affiliate of
Parent, to be present so as to be counted for quorum purposes and voted in
favor of the Company Voting Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, if
following the Acceptance Time Merger Sub is not obligated to exercise the
Top-Up Option and the Company prepares the proxy materials pursuant to Section
6.1(a), or calls the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to Section 6.1(b),
and Merger Sub thereafter, if permitted by applicable Law,
acquires additional Shares, which together with the Shares acquired by Merger
Sub in the Offer represent a number of Shares that, if acquired prior to the
Acceptance Time would have obligated Merger Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option,
and Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option and the Company delivers the Top-
Up Option Shares pursuant to Section 1.4(c), the Company shall, as applicable,
take all steps necessary to terminate and/or withdraw the filings of its proxy
materials with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting and cancel the
Company Shareholders Meeting.

_Section 6.2._ _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) During the period commencing on the date of the Acceptance Time and ending
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will provide, or cause
to be provided, to each Company Employee (i) a base salary or hourly wage
rate, and a total annual compensation opportunity, which is at least equal to
such Company Employees base salary or hourly wage rate and total annual
compensation opportunity (including any cash bonuses)

 



42  immediately before the Acceptance Time and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in employee benefit plans, programs and policies which provide
benefits that are at least comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
provided to such Company Employee under the Employee Benefit Plans sponsored
by the Company immediately before the Acceptance Time (excluding equity based
benefit plan programs or policies). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Company Employee_ " means any Person who is an employee of the Company
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) Parent will grant, or will cause to be granted, full credit to each
Company Employee for (i) his or her employment with the Company prior to the
Acceptance Time for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to
participate in any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company), vesting in any benefit under any such
plan, program or policy and for calculating his or her level of benefits with
respect to severance, vacations, personal days off and any other welfare-type
benefits (expressly excluding any defined benefit pension plan) where service
is a factor in calculating the level of benefits except where such credit
would result in a duplication in benefits, and (ii) any payments made by such
employee or any of his or her dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan for
the plan year for such plan which includes the Acceptance Time for which he or
she was eligible to receive credit under such plan towards satisfying any
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements.

 

(c) Any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) shall not impose any pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, waiting periods or "actively at work" requirements with respect to
any Company Employee, except to the extent such requirements would have been
imposed under the Employee Benefit Plans and have not already been satisfied.

(d) Parent will honor, or cause to be honored, any and all obligations which
the Company has at the Acceptance Time under any Employee Benefit Plans
(including any employment, bonus or similar agreements between the Company and
a Company Employee (excluding any equity based obligations)) to any employee
or former employee of the Company or any dependents of any such employee or
former employee.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Employee Benefit Plan
of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document. Nothing in
this Section 6.2 shall obligate Parent to, or cause the Surviving Corporation
to employ any Person for any period of time after the Effective Time, and this
Section 6.2 shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent to alter the
terms and conditions of, or terminate, the employment of any Person (other
than as provided expressly in this Section 6.2). Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.7(b), nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be construed
as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent or
beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Section 6.2.

 



43 _Section 6.3._ _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof), file or cause to be filed with the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and any comparable non-United States antitrust or
competition authority any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act
or comparable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions. Parent
and Company shall split the filing fee payable to the FTC in connection with
the filing of the notification.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions and to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to obtain
as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any antitrust or
competition authority in order to consummate the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, including this
clause (b), shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to,
or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber or hold separate and agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, business or interest
therein of Parent, or to agree to any changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own
or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
business or interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive
dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the
stock of the surviving company (any of the foregoing, "Detriments"); provided,
however, that Parents "reasonable best efforts" obligation shall require
Parent to sell, license or otherwise dispose of (or agree to sell, license or
otherwise dispose of), businesses or assets of Parent that in the aggregate
produced net revenues in an amount not in excess of $25,000,000 for Parent
during the 2011 fiscal year calculated in accordance with GAAP, on a basis
consistent with the accounting principles used in preparing their respective
2011 audited financial statements as filed with the SEC (provided that (x) in
the case of businesses or assets that were acquired during the 2011 fiscal
year, the net revenues with respect to the business or assets that were so
acquired shall include the net revenues produced by the transferee in the
2011 fiscal year prior to such acquisition, (y) with respect to a product that
was introduced in the 2011 fiscal year or the 2012 fiscal year, aggregate
produced net revenues for purposes of this calculation shall mean such
amounts projected in the most recent regularly prepared budget for the fiscal
year following the year in which the product launches and (z) in the case of
businesses or assets that were acquired during the 2012 fiscal year, the
net revenues with respect to the businesses or assets that were so acquired
shall include net revenues for the 2011 calendar year as reflected on the most
recent regularly prepared audited financial statements of the transferee,
calculated in accordance with GAAP). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
Parent shall not be required to agree to any such dispositions (and shall be
entitled in good faith to contest any threatened or pending litigation or
proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority) unless the failure to do so
would result in the closing conditions not being met hereunder prior to the
earlier of (1) the termination of this Agreement and (2) the Walk Away Date.

 



44 _Section 6.4._ _Public Statements_. The parties shall issue a joint
press release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.8 and until the
Board Appointment Date, the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with each other prior to issuing, and to
provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any public
announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, except as may be required by Law or court process or any
listing agreement with or rules of a national securities exchange or trading
market or by the request of any Governmental Authority; _provided_ , _however_
, that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications
regarding (a) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (b) the matters
referred to in Section 6.8 hereof. In addition, nothing contained herein shall
limit the ability of any party to commence litigation or file any pleadings
in respect thereof without complying with the terms set forth in this Section
6.4.

 

 _Section 6.5._ _Standard of Efforts_. Except as otherwise specified herein
(including Section 6.3), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to take or cause to be taken), all action, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger
and the Transactions, including (a) obtaining all consents,
approvals, authorizations and actions or nonactions required for the
consummation by the parties hereto of the Offer, the Merger and the
Transactions (including any required or necessary action to obtain approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, a Governmental
Authority), (b) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, a
Governmental Authority (c) the obtaining of all necessary consents from third
parties to Company Material Contracts and (d) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay prior to the
Board Appointment Date any fee, penalties or other consideration to any Third
Party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that they
shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such
necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Third Parties
and Governmental Authorities.

_Section 6.6._ _Notification of Certain Matters_. Except as prohibited by
applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or
the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions.

 



45 _Section 6.7._ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Prior to the Board Appointment Time, the Company shall afford, and shall
cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company to afford, the
officers, employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable written notice and in a manner
that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to
the Companys properties, facilities, books and records and other assets as
Parent shall reasonably request, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger
Sub all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel,
in each case (A) as Parent through its officers, employees or agents may
reasonably request, (B) that are in the possession, custody or control of the
Company, and (C) the disclosure of which would not violate any Law, cause to
be waived the attorney client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege, result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any obligation of the Company with respect to
confidentiality; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the Companys
obligations pursuant to Section 6.8, the Company shall have no obligation
pursuant to this Section 6.7 regarding any communications, information or
other materials regarding either (a) a Takeover Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, or (b) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and agents will
hold any such information that is non-public in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Until the Board Appointment Time, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated May 11, 2012 between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 6.8._ _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.8, the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its or any of the Company Subsidiaries Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal until such time, if any, as
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. To the extent
provided in the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement between such
Person and the Company, the Company shall promptly request that each Person,
if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the six-month
period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any
Takeover Proposal return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of
such person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information) and that
such Person provide a certificate of such return or destruction to the
Company.

(b) From the date hereof until the Acceptance Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its or any of its Subsidiaries Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or take any action to knowingly

 



46  facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of a Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person concerning a Takeover Proposal or the making of a Takeover
Proposal, or (iii) furnish any confidential information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate with, assist,
facilitate or encourage any effort, by any Person in connection with a
Takeover Proposal or inquiries regarding a Takeover Proposal or the making of
a Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions
on the Company set forth in this Section 6.8 by any officer, director,
employee or manager of the Company or any of its Company Subsidiaries shall
be a breach of this Section by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.8(b), or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may take the actions set forth in
clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 6.8(b) to or with any Person that has
made a _bona fide_ unsolicited Takeover Proposal if, and only to the extent
that: (A) the Company Board, after consulting with the Companys outside
legal and financial advisors, have determined in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably expected to result
in a Superior Proposal; (B) such Takeover Proposal is not the result of a
breach by the Company or its Company Subsidiaries of this Section 6.8; and (C)
prior to furnishing such information or engaging in discussions or
negotiations, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent) on
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that the Company shall be permitted
to furnish information to Parent as provided in this Section 6.8), as
determined by counsel to the Company, and all such information provided or
made available to such Person (to the extent that such information has not
been previously provided or made available to Parent or is otherwise not
publicly available) is provided or made available to Parent (including by
posting such information in a virtual data room accessible to Parent), as the
case may be, at or promptly following (but in any case within one (1)
Business Day) the time it is provided or made available to such other Person;
_provided, however_ , that the Company may, without breaching, or being deemed
to breach, this _Section 6.8_, (1) enter into negotiations solely with
respect to entering into such confidentiality agreement with a Person who has
made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Takeover Proposal, or (2) contact any Person
that has made a Takeover Proposal, which was not made in violation of this
Section 6.8, to clarify the terms of such Takeover Proposal.

(c) From the date hereof until the Acceptance Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall notify
Parent in writing within two (2) Business Days following receipt by the
Company of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, or request for access to information or the properties, books or
records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person that informs
the Company or such Company Subsidiary that it is considering making, or
has made, a Takeover Proposal. The written notice shall include all material
terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal or such inquiry or request
(including the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry
or request), and, if in writing, shall include a copy of such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
apprised of any material modification of or amendment to such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry or request and of any developments, discussions and
negotiations with respect to such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request. The
Company shall provide Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days) after receipt thereof with copies
of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the
Company from any Person in connection with such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or
request.

 



47 (d) From the date hereof until the Acceptance Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company Board shall not
(i) approve or recommend, or fail to recommend rejection of, any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) fail to make, withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) the Board Recommendation, or
otherwise take any action or make any public statement inconsistent with, the
Board Recommendation (any of the foregoing in clause (i) of this Section
6.8(d) of this clause (ii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or
(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement, option agreement
or similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than the
confidentiality agreement provided for in Section 6.8(b)), (iv) grant any
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Company
Subsidiaries, or (v) take any action to render the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 14A of the NJBCA inapplicable to any
transaction (other than the Transactions). Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.8(d), the Company Board may (1) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or take the actions described in (iv) or (v)
above if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside financial and legal advisors, that failure of the
Company Board to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or take
such action could be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (2) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1A(d) if the Company Board, after consulting with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, has determined in good
faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
take such action could be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1A(d) unless; (i) the Company promptly ( _i.e.,_ within
one (1) Business Day) after a meeting of the Company Board provides written
notice (" _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take any such action and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, (A) the material terms and conditions of a
Superior Proposal, (B) the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and (C) the terms and conditions of any proposed agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal; (ii) during a period commencing on the date that
the Notice of Adverse Recommendation is deemed to be received by Parent in
accordance with Section 9.1 and ending at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
third (3rd) Business Day thereafter (such three Business Day period, the "
_Notice Period_ "), the Company supplies all information reasonably requested
by Parent, otherwise cooperates and negotiates with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with the Board Recommendation and not make such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or so that such Takeover Proposal is no
longer determined to be a Superior Proposal by the Company Board; (iii)
following expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial

 



48  and legal advisors, determine in good faith (after taking into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) that failure of the
Company Board to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change could be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and (iv) the Company has paid to Parent the fee
described in Section 8.3. Any material modification to the terms and
conditions of a Superior Proposal, if any, or a proposed agreement, if any,
relating to such Superior Proposal from those described in a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation shall require the Company to deliver a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and shall trigger a new Notice Period commencing on the date
that the new Notice of Adverse Recommendation is deemed received by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to
a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the Companys shareholders), or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys shareholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys shareholders) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so could reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

_Section 6.9._ _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses,
indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger from the Effective Time
through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each
Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), Judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any Action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether before or after the Acceptance Time in connection
with such Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary of the Company or any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company.

 



49 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, to
cause the individuals who have served as officers and directors of the
Company prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (the
" _D andO Insurance_"), to be covered under a directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
such individuals than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy, for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions of
such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
respect of this Agreement and the Transactions) in their capacities as such,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain
or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
procure and maintain for such six (6) year period as much coverage as is
available for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause
coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by causing the Surviving
Corporation to obtain a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section
6.9(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting
Tail Endorsement," provided that the Company does not pay more than six (6)
times the Maximum Amount for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case,
provided that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, Parent
shall be relieved from its obligations under this Section 6.9(c).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9.

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
6.9). The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection
with his or her enforcement of his or her rights provided in this Section 6.9
and if Surviving Corporation is unable, or unwilling as required, to pay, then
the Parent shall so pay.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors of
the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement.

to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (in accordance with that

severance and employee benefit agreement, arrangement or understanding
entered into by the Company on or after the date of this Agreement with any
of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is
paid to such officers, director or employee to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

_Section 6.12._ _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and Parent and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the Transactions and (b) if
any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option or any of the Transactions, use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up
Option and the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions.

 

 _Section 6.13._ _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC to
enable the de-listing of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation from
the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the deregistration of such common stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

 _Section 6.14._ _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand
and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Board Appointment Date, and (b) prior to
the Board Appointment Date, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

 _Section 6.15._ _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_.

Corporation and, following the Board Appointment Time, the Company, to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement. Immediately following the

51  subsidiary which owns all of the outstanding shares of Merger Sub to execute
and deliver, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent approving and adopting this Agreement.

permitted by, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of Section 6.8;
and (B) the Company simultaneously with such termination pays, or causes to
be paid, the Termination Fee required by Section 8.3(c) to Parent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds; or

(e) by Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform, as
applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would cause the conditions set forth in clauses 2 (b) or 2(c) of Annex A
not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured prior to the earlier
of (x) twenty (20) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform from Parent stating Parents intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1A(e) and the basis for
such termination, or (y) the Walk Away Date;  _provided_ that the right of
Parent to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1A(e) shall not be
available to Parent if Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of any material
covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, and Parent has been
notified in writing of such material breach prior to Parents termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1A(e) and Parent has not cured such
breach within twenty (20) days of receipt by Parent of such notification; or

 



53 (f) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform, as
applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform shall have had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and shall
not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) twenty (20) days following
receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
the Company stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1A(f) and the basis for such termination, or (ii)
the Walk Away Date; _provided_ that the right of the Company to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1A(f) shall not be available to the Company if

forth in this Agreement and the Company has been notified in writing of such
material breach prior to the Companys termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1A(f) and the Company has not cured such breach within twenty
(20) days of receipt by the Company of notice of such breach; or

(g) by the Company, if, for any reason, (i) Merger Sub shall have failed to
commence the Offer within the time period specified in the first sentence of
Section 1.1(a), (ii) Merger Sub terminates or makes any change to the Offer
in breach of the terms of this Agreement, or (iii) Merger Sub shall have
breached its obligation hereunder to purchase all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn as of the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent
Expiration Date established in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

or

 

B. after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect its
obligations under Section 1.3.

(b) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; or

(c) if any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or Law or other legal restraint or prohibition, in
each case making the consummation of the Offer or Merger illegal or
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the
consummation thereof shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided; however that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1B(c) shall not be available to any party to this
Agreement if the issuance of such Judgment, Law, legal restraint or
prohibition was caused by or resulted from the failure of such party (or any
Affiliate of such party) to (i) perform in any material respect any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement required to be performed by such
party (or any Affiliate of such party) or (ii) comply in all respects with the
terms of Section 6.3(b) to the extent required thereunder in connection with
such Judgment, Law, legal restraint or prohibition.

Except in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1A(a) or 8.1B(b) the
party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written notice of
such termination to the other party or parties to this Agreement, setting
forth in such notice the provision of this Section 8.1 pursuant to which such
party is terminating this Agreement.

 



54 _Section 8.2._ _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and of no effect without any liability on the part of any party
hereto, and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease and
terminate, except for the provisions of (a) this Section 8.2 (b) Section 8.3
(Fees and Expenses), and (c) Article 9 (General Provisions), which shall
survive such termination and remain in full force and effect; _provided,
however,_ that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything else
contained herein to the contrary, shall relieve any party from any liability
or damages that is attributable to fraud or to any willful breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination in accordance with the terms
set forth herein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 8.3._ _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is
consummated. If the Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1A(e) as a result of the failure of the conditions listed in Annex A,
paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c), then the Company shall, following receipt of an
invoice therefor, promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, pay
the reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses and advisor and consultant fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination
of this Agreement, up to a maximum amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,500,000) (" _Expense Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds
to one or more accounts designated by Parent. The Expense Fee shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, any Affiliate
thereof or any other Person against the Company and its Affiliates,
shareholders, directors, officers, employees or Representatives in connection
with any termination of this Agreement for which the Expense Fee must be paid,
except in the case of (i) termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1A(e) as
a result of fraud or any willful breach of the Companys covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the failure of the Company to
pay the Expense Fee without simultaneously contesting in good faith that the
Expense Fee is due and payable hereunder.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1A(b)(i) at a time when Parent would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), so long
as, in any such case, (A) before the date of such termination, a bona fide
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been
publicly communicated to the holders of Company Common Stock, and (B) within
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement in respect of such Takeover Proposal, and
such Takeover Proposal is ultimately consummated, then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent, or its designated Affiliate by wire transfer
of immediately available funds an amount equal to $9,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), such payment to be made no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day following the date of the consummation of such Takeover Proposal.

 



55 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.1A(d), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent or its designated Affiliate by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to the Termination Fee, such payment to be made
concurrently with such termination;

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1A(c), Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or its designated
Affiliate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
the Termination Fee, such payment to be made no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day following notice of such termination.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to pay a
Termination Fee pursuant to more than one clause of this Section 8.3 or on
more than one occasion. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable by the Company are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts
payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), (c) or (d), as applicable, are not
a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, (iii) without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would
not enter into this Agreement, and (iv) payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to the applicable provision of this Section 8.3 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, any Affiliate thereof or any
other Person against the Company and its Affiliates, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees or Representatives in connection with any termination of
this Agreement for which a Termination Fee must be paid. Accordingly, if the
Company fails timely to pay the Termination Fee when due pursuant to Section
8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent its documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, plus five
percent (5.0%).

_Section 8.4._ _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to
the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
respective Boards of Directors or shareholders of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any such adoption by the holders of
Shares, no amendment shall be made that, by applicable Law, requires further
approval of such shareholders, without the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

_Section 8.5._ _Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of 

 



56  the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights or preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement. 

_Section 8.6._ _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order
to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board
of Directors (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the approval
contemplated by Section 1.3).

Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be
deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting, preparation
and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any
Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

_Section 9.4._ _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New Jersey without
regard to the conflict or choice of laws provisions thereof that would give

 _Section 9.5._ _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement (i) consents to submit itself to the

respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor

_Section 9.9._ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments
referred to herein that are to be delivered at Closing) and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the terms of the understandings of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
any

 



60  prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any
such prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not
embodied in this Agreement. The representations and warranties set forth in
Articles 3 and 4 and (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein) the
covenants set forth in this Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and (a) may be intended not as statements of
fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if
those statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified by reference
to the Company Disclosure Letter, which contains certain disclosures that are
not reflected in the text of this Agreement; and (c) may apply standards
of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material
by shareholders of, or other investors in, the Company.

_Section 9.10._ _Enforcement_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and this right shall
include the right of the parties to cause the Transactions to be consummated
on the terms set forth in this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond
or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or injunctive
relief or both pursuant to Section 9.10(a), each party may pursue any other
remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including monetary damages;
provided, that it is understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages
following termination of this Agreement shall be limited to those arising from
or relating to fraud or any willful breach of its covenants or agreements or
representations, or warranties set forth in the Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, no party hereto shall be permitted to
make any claim or commence any action, suit or proceeding seeking monetary
damages against any other party hereto in connection with or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions, provided that the foregoing shall be
without prejudice to the right of any party to seek such monetary damages
following such termination in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
set forth in, this Agreement.

_Section 9.11._ _Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or is reasonably
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the
Ordinary Course of Business.

63 Annex A

Conditions to the Offer

Capitalized terms used in this Annex A but not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Agreement_ ") of which this Annex A is a part.

1\. Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange
Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may, subject to the provisions of
the Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for, any
tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions of the Agreement) may
terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Shares, unless
each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), the number of Shares validly tendered
(including by guaranteed delivery) and not properly withdrawn, together with
any Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, equals at
least a majority of the Shares issued and outstanding on a Fully Diluted
Basis immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (after giving effect to
any extensions thereof) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); and

 

(b) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated.

2\. In addition, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay
for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of
the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may,
subject to the provisions of the Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment
of or the payment for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions
of the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any
tendered Shares, if at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and
before the expiration of the Offer, any of the following shall have occurred
and be continuing, unless, if any of the following have occurred and are
continuing, they shall have resulted from the breach by Parent or Merger Sub
of any of their respective obligations under the Agreement:

 

(a) A Judgment shall have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or
by a Governmental Authority, or any Law or other legal restraint or
prohibition, shall be in effect that would make the acceptance for payment of,
or the payment for, some or all of the Shares or the consummation of the Offer
or Merger illegal or otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation thereof; 
_provided_ , that each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have any such Judgment, Law or other legal restraint or prohibition
lifted and shall have complied with Section 6.3 in all respects to the
extent required thereunder.

 



Annex A-1  (b) (i) any of the Companys representations or warranties set forth
in Section 3.1 (first sentence), Section 3.2, Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(d),
Section 3.6 (first sentence), Section 3.20 and Section 3.21 of the Agreement
shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the Acceptance Time (or,
in the case of any such representation or warranty made as of a specific date,
as of such date), without giving effect to materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect Qualifications, or (ii) any of the Companys other
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 of the Agreement that
(A) are not made as of a specific date are not true and correct in all
respects as of the Acceptance Time, or (B) are made as of a specific date are
not true and correct in all respects as of such date, in each case, except
where the failure of such representations or warranties to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations and
warranties), individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(c) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
material covenant or material obligation required to be performed or complied
with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall not have received a certificate executed by
the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer confirming
on behalf of the Company that the conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (c)
of paragraph (2) of this Annex A are duly satisfied immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time;

(e) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or

(f) the Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance
with Article 8 of the Agreement;

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
