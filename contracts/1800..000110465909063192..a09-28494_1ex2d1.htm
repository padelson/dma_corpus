such Transfer Documents.

(c) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller

 **Section 2.6 _AndroGel Milestone Payments_.**

  



  

(a) Abbott Luxembourg will make the following non-refundable milestone
payments to Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium, in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 2.6(b)_ , upon the achievement of the following milestone events:

  



  

(i) One Hundred Million Euros (100,000,000), if the amount of AndroGel Net
Sales during the calendar year 2011 exceeds Five Hundred Million Dollars
($500,000,000);

  



  

(ii) One Hundred Million Euros (100,000,000), if the amount of AndroGel Net
Sales during the calendar year 2012 exceeds Four Hundred Thirty Five Million
Dollars ($435,000,000); and

  



  

(iii) One Hundred Million Euros (100,000,000), if the amount of AndroGel Net
Sales during the calendar year 2013 exceeds Three Hundred Ninety Million
Dollars ($390,000,000)

  



  

(each of (i), (ii) or (iii) an " _AndroGel Milestone Payment_ ", and,
collectively, the " _AndroGel Milestone Payments_ ").

  



  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each of the 2011, 2012 and 2013
calendar years (each a " _Milestone Due Date_ "), Abbott Luxembourg will
deliver to Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium a written report setting forth the
actual amount of AndroGel Net Sales during the preceding calendar year (each
a " _Milestone Report_ ") together with the payment of the respective
AndroGel Milestone Payment if the milestone event for the respective calendar
year has been achieved.  For informational purposes only, within sixty (60)
days following the end of each calendar quarter, Abbott Luxembourg will

  



        
   

  



  

deliver to Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium a written report setting forth an
estimate of the amount of the AndroGel Net Sales during the preceding
calendar quarter.

  



  

(c) During the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 calendar years, Buyer Parent and its
Affiliates will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to commercialize AndroGel
in the Territory. For purposes of this _Section 2.6(c)_ , the term "
_Commercially Reasonable Efforts_ " means, with respect to the activities of
Buyer Parent and its Affiliates with respect to the commercialization of
AndroGel in the Territory during each of the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013
calendar years, the level of effort commonly used in the research-based
pharmaceutical industry in the Territory to conduct activities similar to
those contemplated by the first sentence of this _Section 2.6(c)_  for a
pharmaceutical product that is at a similar stage in its lifecycle and is of
comparable market potential, profit potential or strategic value, taking into
account relevant considerations including safety (including adverse effects)
and efficacy, product profile, the proprietary position, the then-current
competitive environment for such product, the likely timing of such products
entry into the market, the then-current market penetration, return on
investment potential of such product, the regulatory environment and status
of such product, and other relevant scientific, technical and
commercial factors, as measured by the facts and circumstances at the time
such efforts are due.

  



  

(d) During the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 calendar years, Buyer Parent and its
Affiliates will keep Books and Records reflecting the amount of AndroGel Net
Sales (the " _AndroGel Net Sales Records_ "). Within ninety (90) days of the
Milestone Due Date, Seller Parent, at its own expense, will have the right to
notify Buyer Parent that it wishes to have such AndroGel Net Sales Records
(and all related work papers and other information and documents) examined by
an independent accounting firm of nationally-recognized standing reasonably
acceptable to Buyer Parent for the sole purpose of verifying the AndroGel Net
Sales Records. Such independent accounting firm will be subject to a
reasonable confidentiality agreement and will be instructed to redact any
information of Buyer Parent and its Affiliates not relevant to verifying
whether the AndroGel Milestone Payment for the prior calendar year has been
achieved and to provide its audit report to Buyer Parent and Seller Parent.
If Buyer Parent or Seller Parent disputes any such report, it will promptly
notify the other in writing and Buyer Parent and Seller Parent will use good
faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If Buyer Parent and Seller Parent are
unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery of such
written notice, an independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by Buyer
Parent and Seller Parent (the costs of which will be shared 50/50) will
resolve such dispute and such accounting firms resolution will be final and
binding. If such audit concludes an AndroGel Milestone Payment was owed to
Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium, Abbott Luxembourg will promptly pay such
AndroGel Milestone Payment to Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium, plus interest
on the applicable AndroGel Milestone Payment computed at six percent (6%) per
annum for the period from the Milestone Due Date to the date of such payment.

  



  

(e) If at any time (i) Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium earns or receives one
or more of the AndroGel Milestone Payments and (ii) the AndroGel Litigation
Costs incurred by Buyer Parent or its Affiliates from and after the Closing
Date exceed Fifty

  



        
   

  



  

Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in the aggregate, then Seller Parent hereby
agrees and covenants that it would be responsible for an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the AndroGel Litigation Costs (including such AndroGel
Litigation Costs that are incurred prior to the date Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Belgium earns an AndroGel Milestone Payment) that are in excess of Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller Parents
responsibility for the AndroGel Litigation Costs may not exceed the aggregate
amount of the AndroGel Milestone Payments earned or received by Solvay
Pharmaceuticals Belgium (the amount for which Seller Parent is responsible
being, the " _Seller Parent Share of AndroGel Litigation Costs_ "). If Seller
Parent becomes responsible for any Seller Parent Share of AndroGel Litigation
Costs pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ , then if Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Belgium has already received payment of one or more of the AndroGel Milestone
Payments, Buyer Parent will have the right to seek reimbursement for all or
part of, and Seller Parent will pay to Abbott Luxembourg, the Seller Parent
Share of AndroGel Litigation Costs up to the amount of AndroGel Milestone
Payments that have actually been received by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium
at such time. In addition to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing if
Seller Parent becomes responsible for any Seller Parent Share of AndroGel
Litigation Costs pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ , then Abbott Luxembourg
will have a full right of set-off and may apply all or any part of any future
AndroGel Milestone Payments earned by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium to pay
such Seller Parent Share of AndroGel Litigation Costs for which Seller Parent
is responsible under this _Section 2.6(e)_. Abbott Luxembourg may exercise
such right of set-off in its sole discretion, including if (x) Seller Parent
fails to pay any Seller Parent Share of AndroGel Litigation Costs due to
Buyers, (y) Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium has earned (but not yet received)
any of the AndroGel Milestone Payments or (z) the amount of AndroGel
Milestone Payments that have been received by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium
is less than the amount of Seller Parent Share of AndroGel Litigation Costs
then due pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_.

  



  

 **Section 2.7 **_The Closing_ **.**

  



  

(a) Unless this Agreement will have been terminated pursuant to _Article 10_
, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
_Articles 8 and 9_ , the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, Bastion Tower, Place du Champ de Mars, Marsveldplein
5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium, as soon as practicable, but in any event on a
date no later than three (3) Business Days following the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Articles 8 and 9_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), or
at such other date or place as the Seller Parent and Buyer Parent may
mutually agree upon in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). Unless the Seller
Parent and Buyer Parent agree otherwise, the Closing will be deemed effective
in each applicable jurisdiction as of the Close of Business on the Closing
Date.

  



  

(b) _Deferred Local Closings_.

  



  

(i) If, on the Closing Date:

  



        
   

  



  

(A) (1) (x) the Chinese Asset Seller or the Chinese Asset Buyer has not
obtained any required Governmental Approval in the Peoples Republic of China
legally required in order to transfer any of the Acquired Assets to the
Chinese Asset Buyer or in order for the Chinese Asset Buyer to conduct the
Business in the Peoples Republic of China or (y) Sellers or Solvay Thailand
have not taken all necessary actions and steps required to complete the Thai
Business Restructuring in the manner set forth in _Section 5.4_  prior to the
Closing Date, and as a result thereof the Parties are prevented from
transferring any of the Acquired Assets or the Solvay Thailand Shares
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the Acquired Assets and the
Solvay Thailand Shares referred to in clauses (x) and (y), each, a "
_Deferred Local Business_ "), and (2) all other conditions precedent to the
Closing have been satisfied or waived, or

  



  

(B) (1) there is in effect any injunction, restraining order or decree of
any nature of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the
Peoples Republic of China or the Kingdom of Thailand or any Law or
Governmental Order in the Peoples Republic of China or the Kingdom of
Thailand that restrains or prohibits the transfer to the applicable Buyer of
a Deferred Local Business that is not permanent or remains appealable (a "
_Non-Final Injunction_ "), and (2) all other conditions precedent to the
Closing have been satisfied or waived,

  



  

then such Deferred Local Business will be withheld from transfer on the
Closing Date and the portion of the Initial Purchase Price allocated to such
Deferred Local Business will be withheld by Buyer Parent. From and after the
Closing, Sellers and Buyers will continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such Governmental Approvals relating to the
applicable Deferred Local Business, the completion of the Thai Business
Restructuring or the transfer thereof and/or to cause all Non-Final
Injunctions relating to the applicable Deferred Local Business to be lifted.

  



  

(ii) From and after the Closing, and until such time as the applicable
Deferred Local Business has been transferred to the applicable Buyer pursuant
to _Section 2.7(b)(iv)_ (each, a " _Deferred Local Closing_ "), the Deferred
Local Business will be held for such Buyers benefit and account and will be
managed and operated by the applicable Seller for such Buyers benefit and
account, with all gains, income, Losses, Taxes and Tax benefits or other
items generated thereby to be for such Buyers account. The Buyer will
indemnify the Seller Parent and its Affiliates in respect of all Losses
incurred as a result of the operation of the Deferred Local Business for
actions taken in compliance with the instructions of Buyer Parent or its
Affiliates. The applicable Seller and the applicable Buyer will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to allow the applicable Buyer to
receive the uninterrupted use and benefit of any Deferred Local Business from
the Closing Date to the date of its Deferred Local Closing, and to protect
and preserve the value of the Deferred Local Business during such period.
Except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section 2.7(b)_ or the other
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
until a Deferred Local Closing occurs, the applicable Seller will conduct the
Business in such jurisdiction in accordance with the instructions of Buyer
Parent and its Affiliates (including the marketing practices and code of
conduct of Buyer Parent). The Parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any Tax Liability resulting from Deferred Local Closings.
Sellers and their

  



        
   

  



  

Affiliates will have no Liability to Buyers or any of their Affiliates
arising out of the management or operation of Deferred Local Businesses other
than for breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct, for
which breach, negligence or willful misconduct Sellers and their Affiliates
will indemnify Buyers and their Affiliates; _provided_ , that Sellers and
their Affiliates will have no Liability for actions taken in compliance with
the instructions of Buyer Parent or its Affiliates.

  



  

(iii) If a Deferred Local Closing has not occurred by the date that is three
(3) months after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent may, by delivery of written
notice to Seller Parent, request that the Parties expeditiously identify
alternative means or structures by which any remaining Deferred Local
Business (and/or the benefits thereof) may be transferred (or otherwise made
available) to Buyers, and Sellers will effect such transfer by such
alternative means or structure as Buyer Parent may reasonably request.

  



  

(iv) Subject to _Section 2.7(b)(v)_ , each Deferred Local Closing will be
effected on the fifth Business Day after receipt of all applicable legally
required Governmental Approvals, the completion of the Thai Business
Restructuring and the lifting of all applicable Non-Final Injunctions, or at
such other time as the Parties may agree in writing. At such Deferred Local
Closing, the applicable Buyer will pay locally to the applicable Seller the
portion of the Initial Purchase Price allocated to such Deferred Local
Business by wire transfer of immediately available funds in local currency at
the then prevailing spot currency exchange rate as published by the Wall
Street Journal two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Deferred Local Closing relates to Solvay Thailand and
if the portion of the Initial Purchase Price to be paid is not legally
required to be paid in Thai Baht, then such payment will be made in Euros. If
the Deferred Local Business has net profits during the period from the
Closing to the Deferred Local Closing, the amount of such net profits will be
netted against the portion of the Initial Purchase Price to be paid at the
applicable Deferred Local Closing and the amount of funds to be delivered by
the applicable Buyer will be reduced accordingly. If the Deferred
Local Business has a net loss during the period from the Closing to the
Deferred Local Closing, the amount of such net loss will be netted against
the portion of the Initial Purchase Price to be paid at the applicable
Deferred Local Closing and the amount of funds to be delivered by the
applicable Buyer will be increased accordingly. Any disputes with respect to
the net profits or net loss of the Deferred Local Business will be
resolved in the manner provided in _Section 2.9_ for resolution of
disputes relating to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement. If the
Deferred Local Closing relates to Solvay Thailand, prior to such Deferred
Local Closing Buyer Parent will notify Seller Parent in writing of the
Affiliate of Seller Parent to which the share capital of Solvay Thailand will
be transferred at such Deferred Local Closing.

  



  

(v) At any time on or after the date that is the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, so long as Buyers failure to comply with the last sentence of
_Section 2.7(b)(i)_ is not the primary cause of the failure of any Deferred
Local Businesses to be transferred, Buyer Parent may, by delivery of written
notice by Buyer Parent to Seller Parent (each an " _Abandonment Notice_ "),
elect at its sole discretion to abandon the purchase of the remaining
Deferred Local Businesses. As promptly as practicable following the delivery
of an Abandonment Notice, each of Sellers and Buyers will use its reasonable
best efforts

  



         
 

  



  

to restore the other Party to the position it would have been in with respect
to the remaining Deferred Local Business had such items been included in
the Excluded Assets.

adopted by its Board of Directors (or the equivalent thereof) and, if

 **Section 2.9** ** ****_Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_** **.**

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent will prepare,
in cooperation with Seller Parent and its representatives, and will deliver
to Seller Parent a calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital together
with reasonably supporting documentation (the " _Closing Net Working Capital
Statement_ "). The Closing Net Working Capital Statement will be prepared on
a combined basis in accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule
2.9(a)(ii)_ (including any principles providing for exchange rate
adjustments) and, to the extent not inconsistent with such principles, in
accordance with IFRS Standards applied on a basis consistent with the 2008
Audited

  



        
   

  



  

Financial Statements and the Unaudited Financial Statements and reflecting
all adjustments reflected on the Benchmark Net Working Capital Statement.
 Within the same time period, Buyer Parent will deliver to Seller Parent a
statement containing a calculation of the Net Cash together with
reasonably supporting documentation, which will be prepared in accordance
with the definition of Net Cash (the " _Net Cash Statement_ ").

  



  

(b) Seller Parent will complete its review of the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Cash Statement within thirty (30) days of Seller
Parents receipt thereof. In connection with such review, Seller Parent and
its accountants will be provided with full access to the working papers
and other records of Buyer Parent and its accountants used in the preparation
of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Cash Statement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller Parent and its accountants have signed
any customary release letters requested in connection therewith. If Seller
Parent determines that either the Closing Net Working Capital Statement or
the Net Cash Statement has not been prepared on a basis consistent with the
requirements of _Section 2.9(a)_, Seller Parent will, on or before the last
day of such 30-day period, inform Buyer Parent in writing (the " _Objection_
"), setting forth a description containing reasonable detail of the basis of
Seller Parents Objection, the adjustments to the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement or the Net Cash Statement which Seller Parent believes should be
made, and Seller Parents calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or
Net Cash, as the case may be. Seller Parent will be deemed to have accepted
any items not specifically disputed in Seller Parents Objection.  Failure
by Seller Parent to so notify Buyer Parent will constitute acceptance and
approval by Seller Parent of Buyer Parents calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital and Net Cash.

  



  

(c) Buyer Parent will then have thirty (30) days following the day it
receives Seller Parents Objection to review and respond in writing to such
Objection (the " _Response_ "). During the twenty (20) days
immediately following a delivery of Buyer Parents Response, Seller Parent
and Buyer Parent will seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in
Seller Parents Objection. If Seller Parent and Buyer Parent are unable to
resolve all of such differences within such 20-day period, either or
both Parties may refer the remaining differences to KPMG LLP or
another internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as
to which Seller Parent and Buyer Parent mutually agree in writing (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution of all matters which remain in
dispute and which were indicated in Seller Parents Objection. The Accounting
Firm will act as an expert in accounting and not as an arbitrator and will
determine on a basis consistent with the requirements set forth in _Section
2.9(a)_, and only with respect to the specific remaining accounting-related
differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and/or the Net Cash Statement, as applicable,
requires any adjustments. Seller Parent and Buyer Parent will request the
Accounting Firm to use its reasonable best efforts to render
its determination within thirty (30) days.  The Accounting Firms
determination will be conclusive and binding upon Seller Parent and Buyer
Parent. Subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement by the
Accounting Firm on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Parties,
Seller Parent and Buyer Parent will make available to the Accounting Firm all
relevant

  



        
   

  



  

personnel, Books and Records, any working papers (including those of the
Parties respective accountants) and supporting documentation relating to the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and/or the Net Cash Statement, as
applicable, and all other items and support reasonably requested by the
Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be shared
equally between Seller Parent and Buyer Parent.

  



  

(d) The " _Final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital_ " will be the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital contained (i) in the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement in the event that (A) no Objection is delivered
by Seller Parent to Buyer Parent within the 30-day period specified above, or
(B) Seller Parent and Buyer Parent so agree, (ii) in the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement, as adjusted in accordance with Seller Parents Objection,
in the event that (A) Buyer Parent does not deliver a Response to Seller
Parents Objection during the 30-day period specified above following receipt
by Buyer Parent of Seller Parents Objection, or (B) Seller Parent and Buyer
Parent so agree, or (iii) in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, as
adjusted pursuant to the mutual agreement of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent,
or as adjusted by the Accounting Firm, together with any other modifications
to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement mutually agreed upon by Buyer
Parent and Seller Parent.

  



  

(e) The " _Final Statement of Net Cash_ " will be the calculation of the Net
Cash contained (i) in the Net Cash Statement in the event that (A) no
Objection is delivered by Seller Parent to Buyer Parent within the 30-day
period specified above, or (B) Seller Parent and Buyer Parent so agree, (ii)
in the Net Cash Statement, as adjusted in accordance with Seller Parents
Objection, in the event that (A) Buyer Parent does not deliver a Response to
Seller Parents Objection during the 30-day period specified above following
receipt by Buyer Parent of Seller Parents Objection, or (B) Seller Parent
and Buyer Parent so agree, or (iii) in the Net Cash Statement, as adjusted
pursuant to the mutual agreement of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, or as
adjusted by the Accounting Firm, together with any other modifications to the
Net Cash Statement mutually agreed upon by Buyer Parent and Seller Parent.

  



  

(f) (i) Subject to _Section 2.9(g)_, if the calculation of the amount of the
Closing Net Working Capital contained in the Final Statement of Closing Net
Working Capital is less than the Benchmark Net Working Capital, Solvay
Pharmaceuticals Belgium will pay to Abbott Luxembourg an amount in cash in
Euros equal to the amount of such deficiency plus interest on the amount paid
computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the date
of such payment. If, by contrast, the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital contained in the Final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital is
greater than the Benchmark Net Working Capital, Abbott Luxembourg will pay to
Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium an amount in cash in Euros equal to the amount
of such deficiency plus interest on the amount paid computed at the Prime
Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.  All
payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.9(f)(i)_ will be made to the
applicable Party by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds
in Euros within three (3) Business Days after the ultimate determination of
the Final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital as provided in this
_Section 2.9_.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.9(g)_, if the calculation of the amount of the
Net Cash contained in the Final Statement of Net Cash exceeds the Estimated
Net Cash, Abbott Luxembourg will pay to Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium an
amount in cash in Euros equal to the amount of such excess plus interest on
the amount paid computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment. If, by contrast, the Estimated Net
Cash exceeds the calculation of the Net Cash contained in the Final Statement
of Net Cash, Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium will pay to Abbott Luxembourg an
amount in cash in Euros equal to the amount of such excess plus interest on
the amount paid computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment. All payments made pursuant to this
_Section 2.9(f)(ii)_ will be made to the applicable Party by means of a wire
transfer of immediately available funds in Euros within three (3) Business
Days after the ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Cash as
provided in this _Section 2.9_.

  



  

(g) All amounts payable by Abbott Luxembourg or Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Belgium, as the case may be, pursuant to _Sections 2.9(f)(i) and
2.9(f)(ii)_, will be netted against all amounts payable to such Party by the
other Party pursuant to such _Sections 2.9(f)(i) and 2.9(f)(ii)_.

  



  

(h) The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section
2.9_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

 **Section 2.10** ** ****_Allocation_** **.**

  



  

(a) _Schedule 2.10_ sets forth the allocation of the Initial Purchase Price
among the Acquired Assets, the SPML Shares and the Sodufa Shares. The portion
of the Initial Purchase Price allocated to the shares of Solvay India is
further set forth on _Schedule 2.10_. In the event an adjustment to the
Initial Purchase Price is made pursuant to _Section 2.9_ or otherwise
under this Agreement, the allocation of the Initial Purchase Price will be
revised to allocate such adjustment to the Sodufa Shares.

  



  

(b) Except as required by applicable Law, Sellers and Buyers will report the
Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with _Schedule 2.10_  and the Initial Purchase Price
allocation described therein, as it may be revised from time to time, and
will not take any position inconsistent therewith in preparing any Tax
Returns, IRS Form 8594 and any other Tax forms or filings, as well as in
preparing any published financial statements in accordance with IFRS
Standards, and none of Buyers or Sellers will take any position inconsistent
therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any Tax refund claim, or in
any Tax litigation or investigation, without the prior written consent of
Sellers or Buyers, as the case may be.

  



  

 **Section 2.11** ** ****_Consents_** **.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
does not constitute an agreement to sell, convey, assign, assume, transfer or
deliver any interest in any Acquired Asset, or any claim, right, benefit or
obligation arising

  



        
   

  



  

thereunder or resulting therefrom if a sale, conveyance, assignment,
assumption, transfer or delivery, or an attempt to make such a sale,
conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer or delivery, without the Consent
of a third party would (i) constitute a breach or other contravention of the
rights of such third party, (ii) be ineffective with respect to any party to
a Contract concerning such Acquired Asset or (iii) upon transfer, in any way
adversely affect the rights of an Asset Buyer under such Acquired Asset.  If
the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery by any Asset Seller to
an Asset Buyer of any interest in, or assumption by an Asset Buyer of any
Liability under, any Acquired Asset requires the Consent of a third
party, then such sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery or
assumption will be subject to such Consent being obtained.  Without limiting
_Section 2.11(b)_, if any Acquired Asset may not be assigned to an Asset
Buyer by reason of the absence of any such Consent, an Asset Buyer will not
be required to assume any Assumed Liability arising under such Acquired
Asset.

  



  

(b) If any Consent in respect of an Acquired Asset has not been obtained on
or before the Closing Date, Sellers will continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent as promptly as practicable after
the Closing until such time as such Consent has been obtained, and to
cooperate in any lawful and reasonable arrangement which will provide the
Asset Buyer the benefits of any such Acquired Asset,
including subcontracting, licensing or sublicensing to an Asset Buyer any or
all of Sellers or any Asset Sellers rights with respect to such Acquired
Asset and including the enforcement for the benefit of Buyers of any and all
rights of Sellers or any Asset Seller against a third party thereunder. Once
a Consent for the sale, conveyance, assignment, assumption, transfer and
delivery of an Acquired Asset is obtained, the Asset Seller will promptly
assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Acquired Asset to an Asset Buyer,
and the Asset Buyer will assume the obligations under such Acquired Asset
assigned to it from and after the date of assignment to such Asset Buyer. If
and when such Consents are obtained or such other required actions have been
taken, the transfer of such Acquired Asset will be effected in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement

  



  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 2.11_ will be deemed a waiver by Buyers of
their rights under this Agreement, nor will this _Section 2.11_ be deemed to
constitute an agreement to exclude from the Acquired Assets any of the assets
described under _Section 2.1_.

  



  

 **Section 2.12** ** ****_Mixed Use Technology._**

  



  

(a) Sellers, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, will grant
effective immediately after the Closing (and with respect to any Deferred
Local Business, immediately following the applicable Deferred Local Closing)
(to the extent the Sellers and their Affiliates have rights to) to the Sold
Companies and their Affiliates, a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sole and
exclusive (even with respect to the Sellers and their Affiliates) and
royalty-free right and license (with the right to grant sublicenses) under
the Sellers Mixed-Use Technology, solely within the Pharma Health Field of
Use and the Buyer Parent Field of Use. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Pharma Health Field of Use_ " means the business of researching,
developing, manufacturing, selling, marketing or distributing pharmaceutical,
vaccine and diagnostics products and related

  



        
   

  



  

services. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Parent Field
of Use_ " means the business of researching, developing, manufacturing,
selling, marketing or distributing any other products of Buyer Parent or its
Affiliates. Sellers and their Affiliates will have the right, but not the
obligation, to commence, prosecute and defend any Proceedings involving the
Sellers Mixed-Use Technology.

  



  

(b) The Sold Companies will grant effective immediately after the Closing (to
the extent the Sold Companies have rights to) to Sellers and their
Affiliates, a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sole and exclusive (even
with respect to the Sold Companies and their Affiliates) and royalty-free
right and license (with the right to grant sublicenses) under the Buyers
Mixed-Use Technology for (i) all fields other than the Pharma Health Field of
Use and (ii) the manufacturing and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients
for commercial products in the ordinary course of business. The Sold
Companies and their Affiliates will have the right, but not the obligation,
to commence, prosecute and defend any Proceedings involving the Buyers Mixed-
Use Technology.

stock of the Sold Companies;

  



  

(xvi) intentionally do any other act which would cause any representation or
warranty of the Sellers in this Agreement to be or become untrue;

  



  

(xvii) sell inventory to third parties outside of the ordinary course of
business in anticipation of the transaction contemplated herein; or

  



  

(xviii) authorize, commit, or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

  



  

(c) The Buyer undertakes to respond as soon as practicable to any request
from the Sellers in relation of the foregoing and will use reasonable efforts
that all responses are given within five (5) Business Days following the
request.

  



  

 **Section 5.2 ****_Pre-Closing Access; Cooperation_** **.**

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period (and, with respect to any Deferred Local
Businesses, during the period from the Closing Date to the date of the
Deferred Local Closing thereof unless otherwise instructed by Buyers), to the
extent permitted by applicable Competition/Investment Laws and Laws relating
to labor and employment

  



        
   

  



  

matters, Sellers will, and will cause the Sold Companies to, afford to Buyers
and their counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives, all
reasonable on-site and off-site access to the officers, directors,
management, accountants and other advisors and agents, properties, Books and
Records and Contracts of the Business requested by Buyers; _provided_ , that
(i) such access does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Sellers or the Sold Companies and (ii) any such access will be scheduled and

promptly upon availability, provide to Buyers the monthly internal financial
reports prepared for management of the Business.

Buyer Parent with respect to (i) the preparation of any audited balance
sheets for the Business in accordance with GAAP as applied in the United
States and the related statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows
that may be required by Buyer Parent to satisfy the reporting requirements of
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission following the Closing
(including Buyer Parents 2009 audited financial statements) and (ii) an
unaudited opening balance sheet as of the Closing Date in accordance with
GAAP in the Territory.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
will continue in full force and effect following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and all information obtained pursuant to this _Section
5.2_ will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.3 ****_Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents_** **.**

  



  

(a) Sellers and Buyers will use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable under Law to
bring about the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article 8_ and
_Article 9_ and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable.

  



  

(b) Buyers and Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to make, or
to cause to be made, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any required or necessary filing(s) under any
Competition/Investment Laws. The Parties acknowledge that (i)
_Schedule 5.3(b)(i)_ sets forth the jurisdictions identified by the Parties
as of the date of this Agreement where under the applicable
Competition/Investment Laws a notification or approval procedure is mandatory
and suspensive and (ii) _Schedule 5.3(b)(ii)_ sets forth the jurisdictions
identified by the Parties as of the date of this Agreement where under the
applicable Competition/Investment Laws a notification or approval procedure
is necessary but non-suspensive (collectively, the " _Competition Law
Filings_ "). Each such Competition Law Filing will be in compliance with
applicable Law. Each of Buyers and Sellers will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation and making of the Competition Law Filings.

  



  

(c) If no later than fifteen (15) days from the date hereof, either Seller
Parent or Buyer Parent makes a reasonable determination in good faith that in
addition to the

  



        
   

  



  

merger control filings set forth in _Schedule 5.3(b)(i)_ , such Party has an
obligation to make a filing under applicable Competition/Investment Laws in
an additional jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein, then if such Party delivers both (i) an unqualified written opinion
of local legal counsel in the jurisdiction in question that a notification or
approval procedure for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
mandatory and suspensive under the applicable Competition/Investment Laws of
such jurisdiction and (ii) a confirmatory legal opinion from
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (in the case of a request by Seller Parent) or
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton (in the case of a request by Buyer
Parent) that such notification or approval procedure for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is mandatory and suspensive under the
applicable Competition/Investment Laws of such jurisdiction, then such
additional filing will be added to _Schedule 5.3(b)(i)_ and such added
filing will be deemed a " _Competition Law Filing_ " (each such added filing
being, an " _Additional Competition Law Filing_ ").

  



  

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parties agree to cooperate and to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, all Governmental Approvals sought
pursuant to the Competition Law Filings and to respond to any Governmental
Authoritys request for information thereunder and to contest and resist in
good faith any action as a consequence thereunder. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining Governmental Approval, (i) neither Buyers nor any of their
Affiliates will be required to take any of the following actions: (A)
divesting, selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate
or agreeing to divest, sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any entities,
assets or facilities of the Business or any entity, facility or asset of
Buyers or any of their Affiliates; (B) terminating, amending or assigning any
existing relationships or contractual rights and obligations; or (C)
amending, assigning or terminating any existing licenses or other agreements
and entering into new licenses or other agreements, and (ii) neither Sellers
nor any of the Sold Companies will, without Buyers prior written consent,
take or commit to take any such actions listed in (i) above involving the
Business.

  



  

(e) Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each Party will (i)
promptly notify the other Party of any written communication to that Party
from any Governmental Authority and, subject to Law, permit the other Party
to review in advance any proposed written communication to any such
Governmental Authority and will consult with counsel for the other Party,
consider in good faith the views of the other and, if appropriate,
incorporate the other Partys reasonable comments, and (ii) furnish the other
Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
with any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that if either Sellers
or Buyers believes that any such communication to or from a Governmental
Authority contains (or in the case of a meeting is likely to involve
discussion of) commercially sensitive information that it is unwilling to
provide to the other Party, it will be sufficient for Sellers or Buyers, as
the case may be, to provide a copy of such communication (or an opportunity
to attend such meeting) to the other Partys outside counsel.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) All filing fees under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation, other
applicable Competition/Investment Laws or other applicable Laws will be borne
solely by the Buyers. Each Party will bear its own costs (including the cost
of any advisers appointed by it) incurred in connection with the clearances
or any notification to Governmental Authorities.

  



  

(g) Buyers and Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
Consent of any Person (other than Governmental Authorities) required to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  The Parties agree to cooperate reasonably in obtaining
such Consents. To the extent that Sellers and Buyers are unable to obtain
any required third party Consents prior to the Closing, Buyers and Sellers
will use commercially reasonable efforts to make or obtain (or cause to be
made or obtained), as promptly as practicable, all such Consents. For
purposes of this _Section 5.3(g)_, the term "commercially reasonable
efforts" will not be deemed to require any Person to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any
Consent may be required (other than nominal filing or application fees). The
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.3(g)_ are in addition to, and
not in limitation of, the obligations set forth in _Section 2.11_ regarding
Acquired Assets.

  



  

 **Section 5.4 ****_Pre-Closing Restructuring_** **. **Except to the extent
provided in _Section 2.7(b)_, prior to the Closing, Sellers will, and will
cause Solvay Thailand to, implement the Thai Business Restructuring in the
manner set forth on _Schedule 5.4_ and any material deviations therefrom will
be completed in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer Parent and Seller
Parent. Sellers agree that the Thai Business Restructuring will not have any
adverse economic effect (including any Tax Liability resulting from such Thai
Business Restructuring) on Solvay Thailand or the Business.

  



  

 **Section 5.5 ****_Intercompany Loans and Cash_** **.**

  



  

(a) _Schedule 5.5(a)_ contains a true and complete list of all internal
funding or borrowing from Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than
a Sold Company) to any Sold Company (including amounts, currency, interest
rate and due dates) as of the date of this Agreement, which _Schedule 5.5(a)_
will be updated three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Intercompany Loans_ "). Up to twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Buyer Parent will have the right to elect that all or part of
such Intercompany Loans will be (i) repaid in full by the applicable
Sold Companies immediately following the Closing with any amounts required to
be paid deducted from the Initial Purchase Price or (ii) contributed to
the capital of one of the Sold Companies as paid in capital without the
issuance of any additional shares prior to the Closing with Buyer Parent
paying any capital duties associated with such capital contributions. Two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to Buyer Parent
a statement of the amounts outstanding under all Intercompany Loans for which
Buyer Parent elects to repay in full immediately following the Closing.
 Buyer Parent will cause the Sold Companies to repay in full such
amounts immediately following the Closing.  Sellers agree that such amounts
to be repaid may be satisfied in Euros.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Schedule 5.5(b)(i)_ contains a true and complete list of the positive
balance or the negative balance shown on the statements of the internal
financial group account that each Sold Company maintains with Seller Parent
or any of its Affiliates (other than a Sold Company) as of August 31, 2009,
which Schedule will be updated three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date to reflect the balances existing as of such date. Up to twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Buyer Parent will have the right (on a
Sold Company by Sold Company basis) to elect that (i) all or part of any
positive balances in internal financial group accounts of a Sold Company be
transferred to an external, third party bank account of such Sold Company
prior to the Closing and/or (ii) all or part of any negative balances in
internal financial group accounts of a Sold Company (A) be settled prior to
the Closing through, as mutually agreed by the Parties, either a contribution
to capital or payment of any intercompany indebtedness by such Sold Company
or (B) be paid by the Buyers immediately following the Closing to the Seller
Parent and/or its relevant Affiliates in full settlement (but subject to the
post-closing purchase price adjustment set forth in _Section 2.9_ ) of any
amounts due under the negative net balances with any amounts required to be
paid deducted from the Initial Purchase Price. Seller Parent will, or will
cause its Affiliate, to effect the elections of Buyer Parent (other than with
respect to negative net balances to be paid by Buyers at Closing) no later
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing. On the Closing Date, with
respect to each Sold Company, to the extent there are any remaining positive
and negative balances shown on the internal financial group accounts of the
Sold Companies with Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, such balances
will be set-off against each other (other than with respect to negative net
balances to be paid by Buyers at Closing). To the extent that the aggregate
of such net balances is a negative amount, such amount will be paid by the
Buyers immediately following the Closing to the Seller Parent in full
settlement (but subject to the post-closing purchase price adjustment
set forth in _Section 2.9_ ) of any amounts due under the negative net
balances with any amounts required to be paid deducted from the Initial
Purchase Price. To the extent that the aggregate of such net balance is a
positive amount, the Seller Parent will pay or cause its relevant Affiliates
to pay such net positive balance to the Buyer Parent at the Closing in full
settlement (but subject to the post-closing purchase price adjustment set
forth in _Section 2.9_ ) of any amounts due under such positive balances. To
the extent any positive or negative balances are so paid, such amounts paid
will form part of the Cash and/or the Financial Indebtedness for the purposes
of the adjustment of the Initial Purchase Price. An illustrative example of
the treatment of balances in the internal financial group accounts is
attached hereto at _Schedule 5.5(b)(ii)_.

  



  

(c) Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Seller Parent and Sellers will
use their best efforts to minimize the amount of positive balances in
internal financial group accounts (and any other Cash) maintained by Sold
Companies at the time of the Closing by distribution of dividends.

  



  

(d) _Schedule 5.5(a)_ further contains a true and complete list of all
internal funding or borrowing from a Sold Company to Seller Parent or any of
its Affiliates (other than a Sold Company) (including amounts, currency,
interest rate and due dates) as of the date of this Agreement, which
_Schedule 5.5(a)_ will be updated three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Non-Pharma Loans_ "). Seller Parent will, or will cause
its

  



        
   

  



  

respective Affiliates, to repay or settle in full such Non-Pharma Loans prior
to the Closing without causing any Tax Liability on the part of the Sold
Companies as a result thereof.

  



  

 **Section 5.6 ****_Third Party Financial Indebtedness_** **.**

Indebtedness of the Sold Companies to Persons other than Sellers or their
Affiliates (" _Third Party Financial Indebtedness_ ") as of the date of this
Agreement, which _Schedule 5.6(a)_  will be updated three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
to the extent practicable, Sellers will cause all Third Party
Financial Indebtedness to be repaid in full or otherwise satisfied or
eliminated without any continuing Liability of the Sold Companies or causing
any Tax Liability on the part of the Sold Companies as a result thereof.
Sellers acknowledge that (i) Solvay Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg is the sole
borrower under the Financing Agreement, dated July 25, 2008, by and among
Banque Europeenne de Financement, Solvay Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg and
Seller Parent (the " _European Bank Facility_ "), (ii) none of the Sold
Companies has any Liability under such European Bank Facility and (iii) there
are no Encumbrances on any property or asset of the Sold Companies, the
Acquired Assets or the Shares arising from such European Bank Facility.

  



  

(b) To the extent any outstanding Third Party Financial Indebtedness is not
so paid, satisfied or eliminated, then the amount of any such outstanding
Third Party Financial Indebtedness (including any penalties for prepayment in
full of any such Third Party Financial Indebtedness and any interest required
to be paid on any such Third Party Indebtedness which may not be immediately
prepaid in full) will be included in the calculation of Net Cash.

  



  

 **Section 5.7 _Related Party Contracts; Intercompany Accounts_.**

  



  

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.7(a)_ or in the Transition Services
Agreement, on the Closing Date, Sellers will, or will cause their Affiliates
to, terminate each Related Party Contract without causing any Tax Liability
on the part of the Sold Companies as a result thereof.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, other than with respect to any Intercompany
Factoring Receivables relating to third party customer invoices, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, Sellers will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, use best efforts to settle or extinguish any intercompany
receivables or intercompany payables that arose from transactions between the
Sold Companies, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
(other than a Sold Company), on the other hand, in all cases without any
continuing Liability of the Sold Companies or causing any Tax Liability on
the part of the Sold Companies as a result thereof.

  



  

(c) To the extent any intercompany receivables or intercompany payables
(other than any Intercompany Factoring Receivables relating to third party
customer invoices, Intragroup Receivables or Intragroup Payables) are not so
settled prior to

  



        
   

  



  

Closing, such intercompany receivables and intercompany payables ****
will be paid in accordance with their terms following the Closing and will be
part of the calculation of Net Cash.

  



  

 **Section 5.8 ****_Release of Indemnity Obligations_** **. **At or prior to
the Closing, Sellers will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to the Sold Companies, for the benefit of each such company, a
general release and discharge, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyers,
releasing and discharging such Sold Companies from all obligations to
indemnify Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than another Sold
Company) or otherwise hold harmless Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other
than another Sold Company) harmless pursuant to any Contract entered into
prior to the Closing.

  



  

 **Section 5.9 _Credit and Performance Support Obligations_.**

their Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) to be absolutely and
unconditionally relieved on or prior to the Closing Date of all Liabilities
arising out of the letters of credit, performance bonds, corporate guarantees
and other similar items issued and outstanding in connection with the
Business, and Buyers will indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Sold Companies) against any Losses of any kind whatsoever with respect to
such Liabilities. If such release cannot be effected in accordance with this
_Section 5.9(a)_ prior to Closing, Sellers or their applicable Affiliate
will not terminate such Liabilities without the written consent of Buyer
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers will enter into a separate
arrangement with Sellers or their applicable Affiliate to guarantee the
performance of the obligations of the relevant Person pursuant to the
Contracts underlying such arrangements.  Buyers agree to continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to relieve Sellers and
their Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) of all such Liabilities.

  



  

(b) Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Sold

Sold Companies), and Sellers will indemnify Buyers and the Sold Companies
against any and all Losses of any kind whatsoever with respect to such
Liabilities. If such release cannot be effected in accordance with this
_Section 5.9(b)_ prior to Closing, Buyers and the Sold Companies will not
terminate such Liabilities without the written consent of Seller Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will enter into a separate arrangement
with Buyers and the Sold Companies to guarantee the performance of the
obligations of the relevant Person pursuant to the Contracts underlying such
arrangements.  Sellers agree to continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts after the Closing Date to relieve Buyers and the Sold Companies of
all such Liabilities.

  



  

 **Section 5.10 ****_Contact with Customers and Suppliers_** **. **During the
Pre-Closing Period, Buyers and Sellers will cooperate in communicating with
any Business

  



        
   

  



  

Employees, customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, partners or

including Buyers intentions concerning the operation of the Business
following the Closing. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyers and their
representatives will contact or communicate with the Business
Employees, customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, partners or
distributors of the Business in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby only with the prior written consent of Sellers, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and may be conditioned upon a designee of

5.10_ will prohibit Buyers and their representatives from contacting the
customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, partners or distributors of the
Business in the ordinary course of Buyers businesses for the purpose of
selling products of Buyers businesses or for any other purpose unrelated to
the Business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

later than two (2) months thereafter, Buyers will cause each of the Sold
Companies to amend its Organizational Documents to delete any reference to
Solvay in its company name and, within such two (2) month period, to make all
required filing with Governmental Authorities to effect such amendments;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the business of a Sold Company may be
negatively impacted if its company name is amended within such two (2) month
period due to regulatory requirements that would require changes in product
labels and/or updates of product registrations upon the change of such name,
then the respective Sold Company may amend its Organizational Documents to
delete any reference to Solvay in its company name as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing, but in any event within six (6) months of the

relating to the use by Buyers or any of their Affiliates of the Solvay Brands
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_.

  



  

(i) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach
of the requirements of this _Section 5.12_ would be inadequate, and agrees
and

  



         
 

  



  

consents that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be

and (ii) such assumption agreements (including assumption agreements in
relation to specific Acquired Contracts (including such assumption agreements
expressly for the benefit of the counterparties thereto)) and other
instruments of assumption as either Party reasonably may request as necessary
or desirable in order to effect or further evidence the assumption of, and
agreement to pay, perform and discharge when due, the Assumed Liabilities and
the Excluded Liabilities, all as specified in _Article 2_, or to obtain
releases of Sellers and their Affiliates from any Liability with respect to
the Assumed Liabilities or to obtain releases of Buyers and their Affiliates

(b) To the extent that, from time to time after the Closing, Sellers and
their respective Affiliates and/or Buyers and their Affiliates identify
assets that are included in the Business but that are in the possession of
Sellers or their respective Affiliates (including any payments from customers
of the Business that are improperly sent to any of Sellers or their
Affiliates after the Closing), Sellers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to locate such items of the Business and take such action as is
necessary to put Buyers or one of their Affiliates in actual
possession thereof. To the extent that, from time to time after the Closing,
Buyers, the Sold Companies or their respective Affiliates and/or Sellers
identify assets that are included in the Other Businesses, but that are in
the possession of any Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any payments
from customers of the Business relating to customer invoices that have been
assigned to CICC and/or Nafta pursuant to Intercompany Factoring Arrangements
that have been paid in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.24_ that are
sent to any of the Sold Companies after the Closing), Buyers will
use commercially reasonable efforts to locate such items of the Other
Businesses and take such action as is necessary to put Sellers or one of
their Affiliates in actual possession thereof.

  



  

 **Section 5.14** ** ****_Exclusive Dealing_** **. **Sellers will immediately
discontinue and terminate any negotiations or discussions with any Person
(other than Buyers) relating to

  



        
   

  



  

a business combination or transaction involving the Business, including the
sale of any of the Shares or any capital stock of any Transferred
Subsidiaries, the sale of any of the assets of such Persons or the Asset
Seller included in the Acquired Assets (other than sales of assets in the
Ordinary Course of Business), any joint venture or partnership, merger or
consolidation, or any similar transaction or business combination involving
the Business (each, an " _Alternate Transaction_ "). During the Pre-
Closing Period (and, with respect to any Deferred Local Businesses, during
the period from the Closing Date to the date of the Deferred Local Closing
thereof unless otherwise instructed by Buyers), Sellers will not, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, encourage or respond substantively to any inquiries,
discussions or proposals regarding any Alternate Transaction, (b) continue,
propose or enter into negotiations with respect to any Alternate Transaction

information regarding, or afford any access to, the properties, Contracts, or
Books and Records of the Sellers or their Affiliates to any third party
(other than Buyers) for the purpose of determining whether to make or pursue
any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Alternate Transaction, or (d)
enter into any agreement or understanding contemplating any Alternate
Transaction or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement any Alternate Transaction. It is agreed and understood that a sale
of all of the shares or assets of Seller Parent would not constitute an

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, except as otherwise contemplated in this
Agreement with respect to any Deferred Local Businesses prior to a Deferred

Business in developing, manufacturing, producing, marketing, selling or
distributing any products or providing any services of the kind developed,
under development, manufactured, produced, marketed, sold, distributed or
provided by the Business (a " _Competing Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that, for the purposes of this  _Section 5.15(a)_, the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates will not be prevented from:

  



  

(i) being the holder or beneficial owner by way of _bona fide_ investment
purposes only of any units of an authorized unit trust and/or any securities
in any

  



        
   

  



  

company carrying on any Competing Business which are listed or traded on any
recognized stock exchange, regulated market or trading facility provided
always that Sellers do not hold or are not beneficially interested in more
than a total of 10 percent of any single class of the equity securities in
such listed company, and provided that Sellers do not have directly or
indirectly any management functions or any material influence in such a
company;

  



  

(ii) acquiring in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
any one or more companies and/or businesses (taken together, the " _Acquired

in any country under the Competition/Investment Laws of such country, for
such period as will be enforceable in such country under the
Competition/Investment Laws of such country), Sellers agree that they will
not, and will cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, in any
capacity and either separately, jointly or in association with others,
hire or employ or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, or otherwise any Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein will prevent Sellers or their Affiliates
from offering employment or service to (i) any Transferred Employee listed on
_Schedule 5.15(b)_ and (ii) persons who respond to a general solicitation
or advertisement that is not specifically directed at them (and nothing
will prohibit such general solicitation or advertisement).

  



  

(c) Buyers and Sellers acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this
_Section 5.15_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for
the agreement of Buyers and Sellers to comply with these covenants, Buyers
would not have entered into this Agreement. Buyers and Sellers acknowledge
that this _Section 5.15_ constitutes an independent covenant and will not be
affected by performance or non-performance of any other provision of this
Agreement by Buyers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers may not make
claims for rescission of the Agreement as a result of any breaches of
this covenant.

  



  

(d) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this _Section 5.15_ is
invalid or unenforceable, then the Parties agree that the court or
tribunal will have the power (but without affecting the right of Buyers to
obtain the relief provided for in this _Section 5.15_ in any jurisdiction
other than such courts or tribunals jurisdiction) to reduce the scope,
duration or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases

  



        
   

  



  

or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. To the
extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, each of Buyers
and Sellers hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors,
any provision of Law which renders any provision of this _Section
5.15_ invalid, void or unenforceable in any respect.

  



  

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy of
indemnity payments pursuant to _Article 11_ and the other remedies at Law
for any breach of the requirements of this _Section 5.15_ would be
inadequate, and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent injunctive
and other equitable relief may be granted without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy, in any Proceeding which may be brought to enforce
any of the provisions of this _Section 5.15_.

  



  

 **Section 5.16** ** ****_Transition Services Agreement_** **. **Prior to the
Closing, the Parties will negotiate in good faith and enter into a Transition
Services Agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "), the terms of

of its Affiliates and each Sold Company will) (i) continue in force and
comply with the insurance policies set forth in _Schedule 5.17_  in respect
of the businesses and assets of the Business and (ii) will not agree to or
permit any amendment of any of such policy or anything which is likely to
render any such policy void or voidable.

  



  

(b) If any insured event occurs before Closing in relation to the Business,
the Sellers will (or will ensure that their relevant Affiliates will) use all
reasonable endeavors to make recovery under the relevant insurance policy
prior to Closing.  To the extent that recovery is made, the Sellers will (i)
notify and keep informed the Buyers and the relevant Sold Company of the
claim for recovery and (ii) ensure that the proceeds are promptly passed on
to the relevant Sold Company.

  



  

(c) Except to the extent agreed in writing between the Seller Parent and the
Buyer Parent prior to Closing, the Sellers will be entitled to arrange for
the insurance policies listed in _Schedule 5.17_  relating to the Business
(whether maintained with third party insurers or other Affiliates of the
Seller Parent) to cease upon Closing.

  



  

(d) The Parties agree that the Seller Parent will have the right, in its sole
discretion, to assume control over the existing Proceedings relating to the
denial of claims in connection with the HRT Litigation under the insurance
policies subscribed by Seller Parent and/or its Affiliates prior to the date

Sold Companies or the Business incur any Loss which is covered by such
insurance policies in connection with such HRT Litigation, such Parties will
have the right to access insurance coverage of Sellers and its Affiliates.

  



        
   

  



  

To the extent requested by Seller Parent, Buyers will provide reasonable
cooperation to Seller Parent in connection with the Insurance Proceedings.

  



  

 **Section 5.18** ** ****_Post Closing Cooperation_** **.**

  



  

(a) Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other, will cooperate with
each other, and will cause their respective officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives to cooperate with each other after the Closing
to ensure the orderly transition of the Business from Sellers to Buyers and
to minimize any disruption to the Business and the other respective
businesses of Sellers and Buyers that might result from the transactions
contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Buyers and
Sellers will furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
respective employees, counsel, auditors, other representatives and advisors
reasonable access (including the ability to make copies), during normal
business hours, to such employees, advisors, representatives, Books and
Records relating to the Business within the control of such Party or any of
its Affiliates as is reasonably necessary for (i) financial reporting, Tax
and accounting matters and (ii) defense or prosecution of Proceedings and
disputes other than those relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreements; _provided_ , that any such access and information will be
scheduled and coordinated through the person(s) listed on _Schedule 5.2_.

  



  

(b) Sellers will cause all Books and Records, Contracts, documents and other
information, in whatever form, pertaining to or affecting the Business, to be
in the sole possession and control of the Sold Companies or the Asset Seller
at the Closing or Deferred Local Closing, as applicable. To the extent that
any Books and Records, Contracts, documents and other information relevant to
or affecting the Business relate to both the Business and the Other
Businesses, Sellers will provide to Buyers excised portions of such Books and
Records, Contracts, documents and other information pertaining solely to the
Business. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to _Article 6_ hereunder
with respect to Tax matters and Tax records, each Buyer and each Seller will
retain all Books and Records and other documents pertaining to the Business
(and with respect to the Asset Seller, the Other Businesses) in existence on
the Closing Date for a period of five (5) years following the Closing. No
such Books and Records or other documents will be destroyed or disposed of by
any retaining Party during such five (5) year period without first advising
the other Party in writing and giving such Party a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof for the purposes permitted by this _Section 5.18_.

  



  

(c) Each Party will reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this _Section
5.18_. Neither Party will be required by this _Section 5.18_ to take any
action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations. Any information relating to the
Business received by Sellers and their employees, counsel, auditors and other
representatives and advisors pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ will be subject
to the confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section 12.3_.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 5.19** ** ****_Mixed Assets_** **.**

  



  

(a) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, any Contract to which the Asset
Seller is a party prior to the Closing that inures to the benefit or burden
of each of the Business and the Excluded Assets (a " _Mixed Contract_ ") will
be separated on or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, so that the
Asset Buyer and the Asset Seller will be entitled to the rights and benefits
and will assume the related portion of any Liabilities (other than in the
case of the Asset Buyer, Excluded Liabilities) inuring to their respective
businesses. If any Mixed Contract cannot be so separated, the Asset Seller
and Asset Buyer will take such other reasonable and permissible action to
cause (i) the Acquired Assets associated with that portion of each Mixed
Contract that relates to the Business to be enjoyed by the Asset Buyer; (ii)
the Assumed Liabilities related with that portion of each Mixed Contract that
relates to the Business to be borne by the Asset Buyer; (iii) the assets
associated with the portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the
Excluded Assets to be enjoyed by the Asset Seller; and (iv) the Liabilities
(other than Assumed Liabilities) related with that portion of each Mixed
Contract that relates to the Excluded Assets to be borne by the Asset Seller.

  



  

(b) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Parties, the Parties will not
assign any Receivable or payable relating to both the Business and the
Excluded Assets (a " _Mixed Account_ "). In the event of any such Mixed
Account, the Asset Buyer and the Asset Seller will take such reasonable and
permissible actions to cause (i) the Acquired Assets associated with that
portion of each Mixed Account that relates to the Business to be enjoyed by
the Asset Buyer; (ii) the Assumed Liabilities related with that portion of
each Mixed Account that relates to the Business to be borne by the Asset
Buyer; (iii) the assets associated with that portion of each Mixed Account
that relates to the Excluded Assets to be enjoyed by the Asset Seller; and
(iv) the Liabilities (other than Assumed Liabilities) related with that
portion of each Mixed Account that relates to the Excluded Assets to be borne
by the Asset Seller.

respect at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the

satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder, and (c) the failure of any condition precedent set forth in
_Article 8_ or _Article 9_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.22_ will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

the extent related to the Business) and/or the Sold Companies, upon the
shipment of products and or rendering of services to a customer, have
assigned to CICC and/or Nafta the related customer invoices with or without
recourse (i.e. in the case of an assignment without recourse, CICC and/or
Nafta have agreed to assume all credit risk of default and collection from
the customer if the customer does not pay any such invoices when they become

CICC and/or Nafta are subrogated in the rights of the Sold Company or the
Asset Seller under the underlying customer invoice.  Immediately following

being reclaimed by CICC and/or Nafta and, in each case, the underlying
customer invoice being re-assigned to the relevant Asset Seller or Sold

cause to be furnished to Buyers, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance (including, at the expense of Buyers,
reasonable access to Sellers Tax Return preparer, provided that Sellers may
limit such access as they deem necessary to protect Confidential Information
or privileged information) relating to the Sold Companies as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
related

  



         
 

  



  

to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by a Tax Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Sellers
agree to (a) consult with Buyers prior to taking any position or settling any
claim with respect to Taxes that could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyers, and (b) not take any action with respect
to Taxes that would legally bind Buyers without the prior written consent of
Buyers.  Buyers agree to (x) consult with Sellers prior to taking
any position or settling any claim with respect to Taxes that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Sellers, and (y)
not take any action with respect to Taxes that would legally bind Sellers
without the prior written consent of Sellers.

  



  

 **Section 6.2** ** ****_Preparation of Returns_** **.** Sellers will prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in
respect of any of Sellers and the Sold Companies for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns will be prepared on
a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return and in
accordance with Law. Sellers will timely pay to the relevant Tax Authority
all Taxes due in connection with any such Tax Returns. Buyers will prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax
Returns in respect of the Sold Companies including for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date which begins on or before the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "). Buyers will provide Sellers with a copy of each
proposed Straddle Period Tax Return (and such additional
information regarding such Straddle Period Tax Return as may reasonably be
requested by Sellers) for its approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least thirty (30) days prior to the
filing of such Tax Return and Buyers will take into account Sellers
reasonable comments on such Tax Return. Any Tax Return to be prepared and
filed by Buyers for a Straddle Period will be prepared on a basis consistent
with the last previous similar Tax Return and in accordance with Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers may prepare or cause to be prepared any
Tax Return for the Straddle Period on an inconsistent basis if Buyers believe
that such change is required by Law. Buyers will pay, or cause to be paid,
all Taxes shown as due on the Tax Returns prepared by Buyers under this
_Section 6.2_;  _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.2_ will affect
the rights of Buyers to indemnification under _Section 11.10_.

  



  

 **Section 6.3** ** ****_Tax Allocations_** **.** Any Tax imposed on any gain

(b) the transactions contemplated by _Section 5.5_, _Section 5.6_ and
_Section 5.7_ and (c) any other material transactions involving the Acquired
Assets or Sold Companies prior to Closing will be attributable to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period; provided that such Tax is not attributable to a Tax
Return of a Seller or which Seller is required to prepare under _Section
6.2_. With respect to any Tax Return for any Straddle Period of a Sold
Company, Buyers will, to the extent permitted by Law, and without modifying
the financial year of such Sold Company, elect to treat the Closing as the
last day of the taxable year or period and will apportion any Taxes arising
out of or relating to a Straddle Period to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
under the "closing of the books" method as described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i)(or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law). In any case where applicable Law does not permit a Sold Company
to treat the Closing as the last day of the

  



        
   

  



  

taxable year or period, any Taxes arising out of or relating to a Straddle
Period will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-
Closing Straddle Period based on a closing of the books; provided, however,
that (x) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annualized basis (including depreciation, amortization and depletion
deductions) will be apportioned on a daily pro rata basis, (y) solely for
purposes of determining the marginal Tax rate applicable to income during
such period in a jurisdiction in which such Tax rate depends upon the level
of income, annualized income will be taken into account, and (z) the amount
of real, personal and intangible property Taxes (and any refund or credit for
such Taxes) allocable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period will equal the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire period.

  



  

 **Section 6.4** ** ****_Refunds and Credits_**. Any refund of or credit for
Taxes of any Sold Company for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date (and the allocable portion of any such refund or credit for any
Pre-Closing Straddle Period) will be for the account of the Sellers except to
the extent (a) that such refund or credit is attributable (determined on a
marginal basis) to the effect of any loss, deduction, credit or other item
from a taxable period after the Closing Date (or the allocable portion of any
such item from a Straddle Period) or (b) of accruals for such refund or
credit are shown in the Audited Financial Statements, Final Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital or Final Statement of Net Cash or would have been
shown but for the availability of liabilities against which the refund
or credit was offset in accordance with GAAP. Any other refund of or credit
for Taxes of any Sold Company will be for the account of the Buyers. If any
Party or its Affiliates receives a Tax refund or credit to which another
Party is entitled, such Party will or will cause its Affiliates to pay an
amount equal to the refund or credit to the Party entitled to it within 30
Business Days after receiving the refund or applying the credit against a Tax
amount then due. Any such payment with respect to a Tax refund or credit will
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

 **Section 6.5** ** ****_Tax Agreements_** **.** Except for those between
Sold Companies, all Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements with
respect to or involving the Business will be terminated prior to the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, Buyers and their respective Affiliates will
not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

 **Section 6.6** ** ****_Certain Tax Elections_** **.  **Buyers may make an
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any Sold Company
except for a Sold Company organized under the laws of any of the states of
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. At the
request of Buyer Parent, Seller Parent will, and will cause the Sold
Companies to, make any tax elections, including the tax election under
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c) with respect to one or more of the
Sold Companies to be effected prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the
designated Sold Company is an "eligible entity" for purposes of such Treasury
Regulation. Buyers and Sellers will cooperate in properly filing any such Tax
election under this _Section 6.6_.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 6.7** ** ****_Transfer Taxes_** **.** All Transfer Taxes other
than VAT (for which Buyers will bear) applicable to the conveyance and
transfer from Sellers to Buyers of the Shares, Sold Companies, the
Business or the Acquired Assets and any other transfer or documentary Taxes
in connection therewith will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyers and
fifty percent (50%) by Sellers. Each Party will, with the exception of
transfers of tangible assets where Sellers will, wherever relevant, have the
right to elect to apply VAT, use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the
other Parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7**

  



  

 **EMPLOYEE MATTERS**

  



  

 **Section 7.1** ** ****_Transferred Employees_** **.  **As applicable, a
Sold Company or the Asset Buyer will (a) continue to employ each Business
Employee of a Sold Company as of the Closing, (b) continue to employ each
Business Employee as of the Closing where employment transfers by operation
of Law, provided that such Business Employee does not validly reject the
automatic transfer in accordance with applicable Law, (c) on or prior to the
Closing, make individual offers of employment with respect to all other
Business Employees employed by the Asset Seller whose employment does
not transfer to the Asset Buyer by operation of Law, and (d) on or prior
to the Closing, make individual offers of employment with respect to each
employee of Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium listed on _Schedule 7.1_ , which
_Schedule 7.1_ sets forth the name, title, position and location of each such
employee (such scheduled employees being, the " _Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Belgium Employees_ "), in each case on substantially the same terms and
conditions as in effect for each such employee prior to the Closing (except
as otherwise provided herein). To the extent an individual Solvay
Pharmaceuticals Belgium Employee refuses to transfer to Buyers, Sellers may
terminate the employment of such Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium Employee and,
if terminated within a period of three (3) months following the Closing Date,
Buyers will bear the severance costs (up to the amount of the severance costs
that would be applicable if such Solvay Pharmaceuticals Belgium Employee had
been dismissed on the Closing Date) in respect of such Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Belgium Employee. For purposes of this Agreement, (v) "
_Transferred Employee_ " means each Business Employee of a Sold Company and
each Business Employee whose employment transfers to the applicable Buyer by
operation of Law (provided that such Business Employee does not validly
reject the automatic transfer in accordance with applicable Law) or who
accepts the offer of employment by a Buyer, (w) " _Non-U.S. Business
Employee_ " means a Business Employee employed by an employer domiciled
outside the United States as of the Closing, (x) " _Non-U.S. Transferred
Employee_ " means each Non-U.S. Business Employee of a Sold Company who
remains employed by such Sold Company as of the Closing and each Non-U.S.
Business Employee whose employment transfers to the applicable Buyer by
operation of Law (provided that such Non-U.S. Business Employee does not
validly reject the automatic transfer in accordance with applicable Law), or
who accepts the offer of employment by a Buyer, (y) " _U.S. Business
Employee_ " means a Business Employee employed by an employer domiciled
inside the United States as of the Closing, and (z)

  



        
   

  



  

" _U.S Transferred Employee_ " means each U.S. Business Employee of a Sold
Company who remains employed by such Sold Company as of the Closing.

  



  

 **Section 7.2** ** ****_General Employee Benefits_** **.**

  



  

(a) For a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing,
Transferred Employees who remain in the employment of the applicable Asset
Buyer or Sold Company or any of its or their Affiliates will receive employee
benefits that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee
benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing (with no
reduction in employer-paid value, based on comparability standards used by
nationally recognized benefits consulting firms). For a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing, the Transferred Employees who remain in the
employment of the applicable Asset Buyer or Sold Company or its or their
Affiliates will receive base salary or wage rates that are not less than
those in effect for such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. Except as required by Law or expressly set forth herein, nothing
contained in this Agreement will be construed as requiring the Buyers or any
of their Affiliates to continue or offer any specific employee benefit plans
or to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee or any other
Person.

  



  

(b) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the applicable Asset Buyer
or Sold Company or its or their Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing, such Asset Buyer or Sold Company
or Affiliate will (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by
Sellers or any of their Affiliates prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Closing in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

  



  

(c) With respect to Transferred Employees, the Asset Buyers or Sold Companies
will, and will cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all
applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to the Transferred
Employees.

  



  

(d) The Asset Buyer or its Affiliates will assume all Liabilities related to
the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees employed by it, including any Liabilities
under any Seller Non-U.S. Benefit Plan regardless of whether such employee
benefit plan transfers automatically to the Asset Buyer or its Affiliates as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as
otherwise provided in _Sections 7.4 and 7.5_. In addition to any Assets that
will transfer automatically to the Asset Buyer or its Affiliates or to the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees employed by it as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers will cause to be
transferred to the Asset Buyer or its Affiliates, or the appropriate
compensation or benefit plan of the Asset Buyer or its Affiliates, such
Assets, if any, specifically set aside and designated by Sellers in respect
of the Liabilities related to the affected Non-U.S. Transferred Employees as
of the Closing, including Assets of any applicable compensation or benefit
plan of Sellers, to

  



        
   

  



  

the extent such Assets do not transfer automatically to the Asset Buyer or
its Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. However, any such transfer will be subject to the consent of the
affected Non-U.S. Transferred Employees or any other third party to the
extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

(e) If the Pension Liabilities exceed the sum of (i) 300,000,000, (ii) the
Fair Market Value of the Pension Transfer Amounts referred to in
_Sections 7.3(a)_ (but only with respect to the Solvay America Companies
Pension Plan) and _7.4(b)_ and allocable to such Pension Liabilities, and
(iii) the Fair Market Value of the Assets under the trusts under the Sold
Company Pension Plans and allocable to such Pension Liabilities (the sum of
(i), (ii) and (iii) hereinafter referred to as the " _Transferred Amounts_
"), Sellers agree to indemnify Buyers for such excess amount (such excess
hereinafter referred to as the " _Buyers Pension Indemnification Amount_ ").
Sellers agree to pay Buyers in cash the Buyers Pension Indemnification Amount
as soon as practicable but not later than ten (10) days after the date of the
determination which fixes the Buyers Pension Indemnification Amount. If the
sum of (x) Fair Market Value of the Pension Transfer Amounts referred to in
_Sections 7.3(a)_ (but only with respect to the Solvay America Companies
Pension Plan) and _7.4(b)_ and allocable to such Pension Liabilities and (y)
the Fair Market Value of the Assets under the trusts under the Sold Company
Pension Plans and allocable to such Pension Liabilities, exceeds such Pension
Liabilities, Buyers agree to indemnify Sellers for such excess amount (such
excess amount hereinafter referred to as the " _Sellers Pension
Indemnification Amount_ "). Buyers agree to pay Sellers, in cash, the Sellers
Pension Indemnification Amount as soon as practicable but not later than ten
(10) days after the date of the determination which fixes the Sellers Pension
Indemnification Amount. Interest from the Closing Date to the date of
payment, at the Prime Rate, will be paid along with the Buyers
Pension Indemnification Amount or Sellers Pension Indemnification Amount,
as applicable. Sellers and Buyers jointly will provide Sellers and Buyers
actuaries with all relevant plans and employee census information needed to
calculate the Pension Liabilities within thirty (30) days after Closing. The
Pension Liabilities will be determined by mutual agreement between Sellers
and Buyers within thirty (30) days after their actuaries receipt of
said information. If Sellers and Buyers cannot agree on the amount of such
Pension Liabilities within said 30-day period, Sellers and Buyers will
appoint within five (5) days a mutually acceptable actuary who will review
their calculations and within forty-five (45) days after appointment, render
a final and binding decision on the amount of the Pension Liabilities and who
will, in making such decision, be limited on a plan by plan basis to either
the position of Sellers or Buyers. The cost of the actuary will be borne
50/50 by Sellers and Buyers. In connection with the procedures referred to
herein, Sellers and Buyers will provide each other and the actuaries referred
to herein access to the relevant business records and other relevant
documents, and will permit the other Party to consult with its employees and
the employees of its Affiliates. The indemnifications provided for in this
_Section 7.2(e)_ are separate and apart from any other indemnification
provision of this Agreement. Any payment made by Sellers or by
Buyers pursuant to this _Section 7.2(e)_ will be treated as an adjustment
of the Purchase Price. " _Fair Market Value_ " means the fair market value
determined as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this determination, (i)
the Fair Market Value of cash or cash equivalents will be the face value,
(ii) the Fair Market Value of readily marketable securities will be the
closing price on the date of

  



        
   

  



  

determination and (iii) the Fair Market Value of any other asset will be as
determined by mutual agreement of Buyers and Sellers. " _Assets_ " means
cash or cash equivalents, insurance contracts, securities or any
other property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
7.2(e)_, if the existence or the amount of the Pension Liabilities referred
to in this _Section 7.2(e)_ depends on the outcome of any of the Proceedings
described on _Schedule 7.2(e)_ , the Pension Liabilities will be redetermined
immediately following the conclusion of such Proceedings and any appropriate
corresponding adjustment will be made to the Buyers Pension Indemnification
Amount or the Sellers Pension Indemnification Amount, whichever is
applicable.

  



  

(f) The Buyers and Sellers agree, and agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure, that any Liabilities under any Pension Arrangements that
are attributable to employees and former employees who are not Business
Employees or Former Employees (the " _Non-Business Pension Liabilities_ "),
and the Fair Market Value of the Assets allocable to such Liabilities, will
be retained by or transferred to a pension plan maintained by (or, if this is
not possible, otherwise assumed by) Sellers or one of their Affiliates within
twelve (12) months of the Closing Date. If the Non-Business Pension
Liabilities cannot be retained by or transferred to a pension plan maintained
by (and cannot be otherwise assumed by) Sellers or one of their Affiliates
within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, and the Non-Business
Pension Liabilities exceed (i) the Fair Market Value of the Pension
Transfer Amounts referred to in _Section 7.3(a)_ (but only with respect to
the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan) and _7.4(b)_ and allocable to
the Non-Business Pension Liabilities, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the
Assets under the trusts under the Sold Company Pension Plans and allocable to
the Non-Business Pension Liabilities (the sum of (i) and (ii) hereinafter
referred to as the " _Non-Business Transferred Amounts_ "), Sellers agree to
indemnify Buyers for such excess amount (such excess hereinafter referred to
as the " _Buyers Non-Business Pension Indemnification Amount_ "). Sellers
agree to pay Buyers in cash the Buyers Non-Business Pension Indemnification
Amount as soon as practicable but not later than ten (10) days after the date
of the determination which fixes the Buyers Non-Business Pension
Indemnification Amount. If the Non-Business Transferred Amounts exceed the
Non-Business Pension Liabilities, Buyers agree to indemnify Sellers for such
excess amount (such excess amount hereinafter referred to as the " _Sellers
Non-Business Pension Indemnification Amount_ "). Buyers agree to pay Sellers,
in cash, the Sellers Non-Business Pension Indemnification Amount as soon as
practicable but not later than ten (10) days after the date of the
determination which fixes the Sellers Non-Business Pension Indemnification
Amount. Interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment, at the Prime
Rate, will be paid along with the Buyers Non-Business Pension Indemnification
Amount or Sellers Non-Business Pension Indemnification Amount, as applicable.
Sellers and Buyers jointly will provide Sellers and Buyers actuaries with
all relevant plans and employee census information needed to calculate the
Non- Business Pension Liabilities within thirty (30) days of the date that is
twelve (12) months after Closing. The Non-Business Pension Liabilities will
be determined by mutual agreement between Sellers and Buyers within thirty
(30) days after their actuaries receipt of said information. If Sellers and
Buyers cannot agree on the amount of the Non-Business Pension Liabilities
within said 30-day period, Sellers and Buyers will appoint within five (5)
days a mutually acceptable actuary (who will, if any actuary is appointed for
the purposes of determining the Pension

  



        
   

  



  

Liabilities under _Section 7.2(e)_ above, be the same actuary) who will
review their calculations and within forty-five (45) days after appointment,
render a final and binding decision on the amount of the Non-Business Pension
Liabilities and who will, in making such decision, be limited on a plan by
plan basis to either the position of Sellers or Buyers. The cost of the
actuary will be borne 50/50 by Sellers and Buyers. In connection with the
procedures referred to herein, Sellers and Buyers will provide each other and
the actuaries referred to herein access to the relevant business records and
other relevant documents, and will permit the other Party to consult with its
employees and the employees of its Affiliates. The indemnifications provided
for in this _Section 7.2(f)_ are separate and apart from any other
indemnification provision of this Agreement. Any payment made by Sellers or
by Buyers pursuant to this _Section 7.2(f)_ will be treated as an adjustment
of the Purchase Price.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 7.2(f)_, if the existence or the amount of the Liabilities referred
to in this _Section 7.2(f)_ depends on the outcome of any of the Proceedings
described on _Schedule 7.2(e)_ , the Non-Business Pension Liabilities will be
redetermined immediately following the conclusion of such Proceedings and any
appropriate corresponding adjustment will be made to the Buyers Non-Business
Pension Indemnification Amount or the Sellers Non-Business Pension
Indemnification Amount, whichever is applicable.

  



  

(g) Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee who participates
in the Solvay Healthcare Limited Share Incentive Plan (the " _SIP_ ") will
cease participation in the SIP and will have his or her payroll
deductions refunded by the Sellers as soon as administratively practicable in
accordance with the terms of the SIP.

  



  

 **Section 7.3** ** ****_Transferred U.S. Plans_**

  



  

(a) As of the Closing, (i) the Sellers or their Affiliates will take any and
all actions necessary to transfer the sponsorship of the Transferred U.S.
Plans (which are not sponsored by a Sold Company) to the relevant Sold
Company, Buyers or their Affiliates; (ii) the Sellers or their Affiliates
will take all actions necessary to transfer any and all Assets of any funded
Transferred U.S. Plan to the Sold Company, Buyers or their Affiliates (or
plans sponsored by any such entity) in accordance with the principles and
procedures similar to the principles and procedures described in  _Section
7.4_ (including _Section 7.4(d)_)(subject to the provision below in this
Section in relation to the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan, such
transferred Assets being collectively referred to as " _Pension Transfer
Amounts_ "); (iii) Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates to, take any and
all action necessary to assume the sponsorship of the Transferred U.S. Plans
(not currently sponsored by a Sold Company) and cause the appropriate trusts
to take title to plan Assets; and (iv) Buyers and their Affiliates will
assume or the Sold Company will retain (as applicable), all Liability with
respect to the Transferred U.S. Plans, including benefit Liabilities of
Solvay America, Inc. or its Affiliates or the Solvay America Companies
Pension Plan related to the accrued benefits of U.S. Transferred Employees or
U.S. Former Employees (and their respective beneficiaries) resulting from the
outcome of the Jensen Cash Balance Litigation, and any such benefit
Liabilities assumed by Buyers or their Affiliates or retained by a Sold
Company will also constitute "Pension Liabilities" for purposes of this
Agreement, but expressly excluding any fines, penalties, punitive or special
damages, attorneys fees or other litigation costs, or substantially

  



        
   

  



  

similar Liabilities. All transfers of Assets and Liabilities will be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 414(l).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.3(a)_, within
thirty (30) days of the Closing, Sellers will cause to be transferred to a
trust designated by Buyers, which trust is intended to be exempt from U.S.
federal income tax under Code Section 501(a) (the " _Buyers Trust_ "), at
least ninety (90) percent (as estimated by Sellers actuary) of the Fair
Market Value of the Assets of the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan
allocable to the Pension Liabilities attributable to the U.S. Transferred
Employees and U.S. Former Employees (and their respective beneficiaries)
(such transfer of Assets from the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan will
be the " _First Pension Transfer Amount_ " and will be treated as a Pension
Transfer Amount for the purposes of this _Section 7.3_). As soon as
reasonably practicable after the final determination of the amount to be
transferred by Sellers actuary (the " _Final Determination Date_ "), Sellers
will cause to be transferred to the Buyers Trust a Final Transfer Amount (as
defined below) (which will be treated as a Pension Transfer Amount for
purposes of this _Section 7.3_) calculated as follows:

  



  

(i) the total Fair Market Value of the Assets of the Solvay America
Companies Pension Plan allocable to the Pension Liabilities attributable to
the U.S. Transferred Employees and U.S. Former Employees will be reduced by
the First Pension Transfer Amount (the resulting amount, the " _Net Transfer
Amount_ ");

  



  

(ii) the Net Transfer Amount will be adjusted for the proportionate earnings
and losses under the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan from the date of
transfer of the First Pension Transfer Amount through the date immediately
preceding this final transfer (the resulting amount, the " _Adjusted Net
Transfer Amount_ ");

  



  

(iii) the Adjusted Net Transfer Amount will be reduced by the amount of
benefits paid from the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan to U.S.
Transferred Employees and U.S. Former Employees from the Closing through the
date of the transfer of the First Pension Transfer Amount (the "
_Trailing Benefit Payments_ ") (the resulting amount, the " _Final Transfer
Amount_ ").

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the First Pension Transfer
Amount plus the Trailing Benefit Payments exceeds the Fair Market Value of
the Assets of the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan allocable to the
Pension Liabilities attributable to the U.S. Transferred Employees and U.S.
Former Employees (and their respective beneficiaries), the Buyers Trust will
transfer the difference (such difference will be adjusted for the
proportionate earnings and losses under the Buyers Trust from the date of
transfer of the First Pension Transfer Amount through the date immediately
preceding this transfer) back to the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Final Determination Date.

  



  

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyers or their Affiliates will establish or
designate defined contribution plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section

  



        
   

  



  

401(a) of the Code (collectively, the " _U.S. Buyer DC Plans_ ") for the
benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees. Each U.S. Transferred Employee as
of the Closing will be immediately eligible to participate in a U.S. Buyer DC
Plan and will receive credit for service with Sellers and their Affiliates
for all purposes thereunder.

  



  

(c) Each U.S. Buyer DC Plan will provide for the receipt in cash from U.S.
Transferred Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is
defined under Section 402 of the Code) and will also accept the rollover of
participant loans from Seller U.S. Benefit Plans that are tax-qualified
defined contribution plans.  Buyers and Sellers will work together in order
to facilitate any such distribution or rollover and to effect an eligible
rollover distribution for those U.S. Transferred Employees who elect to
rollover their account balances or loans directly into a U.S. Buyer DC Plan.

  



  

(d) For a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing, and
subject to compliance with applicable Law, including compliance with any
requirements under the Code in order to secure favorable tax treatment,
Buyers or their Affiliates will provide to eligible U.S.
Transferred Employees and eligible U.S. Former Employees who are eligible at
Closing (and their respective eligible dependents) retiree health and life
coverage, medical coverage for disabled employees, and coverage under a
defined benefit retirement plan with a cash balance feature or, with respect
to eligible U.S. Transferred Employees who participate in the final salary
related portion of the Solvay America Companies Pension Plan, a final salary
benefit formula.

  



  

 **Section 7.4** ** ****_Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans_** **.**

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyers or their Affiliates will establish or
designate defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. Buyer
Pension Plans_ ") for the benefit of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and
Non-U.S. Former Employees who participated in one or more of the defined
benefit pension plans (other than a stand-alone plan that is sponsored by a
Sold Company and covers primarily Business Employees and Former Employees,
hereinafter, a " _Sold Company Pension Plan_ ") maintained by Sellers or
their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Seller Pension Plans_ "). Such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees are referred
to hereinafter as the " _Pension Plan Employees_ " and such Non-U.S. Former
Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _Pension Plan Former
Employees_ ". Each Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan will provide benefit plan
formulas and provisions that are equivalent in value to the benefit
plan formulas and provisions in the corresponding Seller Pension Plan as of
the Closing and Buyers or their Affiliates will either continue such Non-U.S.
Buyer Pension Plan on the same basis, or offer comparable benefits (with
no reduction, in either case, in employer-paid value, based on
comparability standards used by nationally recognized benefits consulting
firms) to the Pension Plan Employees, for a period of at least twelve (12)
months immediately following the Closing. The Pension Plan Employees will be
given credit under the respective Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan for all service
with and compensation from Sellers or their Affiliates as if it were
continuous service with and compensation from Buyers or their Affiliates for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of any
benefits or benefit accruals under each respective Non-U.S. Buyer Pension
Plan and the Pension Plan

  



        
   

  



  

Former Employees will be given credit under the respective Non-U.S. Buyer
Pension Plan that is equivalent to their vested accrued benefits under the
respective Seller Pension Plan (the credits being provided to the Pension
Plan Employees and the Pension Plan Former Employees under each Non-U.S.
Buyer Pension Plan being " _Transfer Credits_ ") and, subject to and
contingent upon the transfer of Assets from the UK Pension Plan to the
relevant Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan established or designated by Buyers in
the United Kingdom (the " _Buyer s UK Pension Plan_"), for a period of at
least twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing, Buyers will
procure (i) that the Buyers UK Pension Plan provides that the accrued
benefits representing continuous service attributable to Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees who continue in employment with Buyers or their Affiliates that are
transferred from the UK Pension Plan to the Buyers UK Pension Plan will have
a continuing link to final salary in respect of the service of the Pension
Plan Employees with the Buyers and their Affiliates and (ii) if required by
the trustees of the UK Pension Plan in order to agree to a transfer of assets
and liabilities from the UK Pension Plan to the Buyers UK Pension Plan, that
the benefits of the Pension Plan Employees and the Pension Plan Former
Employees and the Assets that are transferred from the UK Pension Plan are
provided and held under a section of the Buyers UK Pension Plan that
is segregated or sectionalized as to assets and liabilities for the purposes
of the UK funding and employer debt legislation.  Each Non-U.S. Buyer
Pension Plan will provide, upon the transfer of Assets referred to below (or,
if there is no transfer of Assets with respect to a particular plan because
the plan is not required to be funded under applicable Law, as of the
Closing), that the accrued benefits for the Pension Plan Employees and
Pension Plan Former Employees under such Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan will in
no event be less than their accrued benefits under the corresponding Seller
Pension Plan as of the Closing. Sellers agree to (x) as soon as reasonably
practicable, request the trustees of the UK Pension Plan agree to Buyer
Parent being represented, between the signing of this Agreement and the date
of the transfer of Assets from the UK Pension Plan, on the
investment committee of the UK Pension Plan in respect of the investments of
the Duphar Section of the UK Pension Plan, or (y) if it cannot be agreed with
the trustees that Buyer Parent be so represented on such investment
committee, consult with Buyer Parent, between the signing of this Agreement
and the date of the transfer of Assets from the UK Pension Plan, in respect
of all matters relating to the investments of the Duphar Section of the UK
Pension Plan on which Sellers are consulted by the trustees.

  



  

(b) With respect to any Seller Pension Plan maintained outside of the United
States, Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
transferred from the trusts under such Seller Pension Plan to the trusts
under the corresponding Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan Assets allocable to the
relevant Pension Liabilities under such Seller Pension Plan the Fair Market
Value of which will be equal to such amount required under locally applicable
transfer law and regulations (collectively referred to as the "
_Pension Transfer Amounts_ "). The transfer of the Pension Transfer Amounts,
and the assumption by Buyers or their Affiliates of Liabilities with respect
to or relating to the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees under the applicable
Seller Pension Plans, will be subject to such minimum consents, approvals and
other legal requirements as may apply under applicable Law, including if
required the consent of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employee or any other third
party to the extent required by applicable Law. Buyers and their

  



         
 

  



  

Affiliates will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
corresponding Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plans to accept the Pension Transfer
Amounts as soon as possible.

  



  

(c) As of the date of Closing, Sellers or their Affiliates will cause the
Non-U.S. Transferred Employees to cease further accrual of benefits under the
Seller Pension Plans (other than the Sold Company Pension Plans).

  



  

(d) The Pension Transfer Amount, if any, from each Seller Pension Plan will
be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit payments made from, and
for the proportionate earnings and losses of, the Seller Pension Plans to the
Pension Plan Employees and Pension Plan Former Employees after the Closing
but prior to the date of transfer.

  



  

(e) Subject to such consents, approvals and other legal requirements as may
apply under applicable Law, Sellers and their Affiliates will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of the Pension Transfer
Amounts to take place within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
Closing.

  



  

(f) At the times of the transfers of the Pension Transfer Amounts, Buyers and
their Affiliates and the Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plans will assume all
Liabilities for all accrued benefits, including all disability, part-time and
other ancillary benefits, under the corresponding Seller Pension Plans in
respect of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and Non-U.S. Former Employees
whose benefits are transferred, and Sellers and their Affiliates and the
corresponding Seller Pension Plans will be relieved of all Liabilities to
provide benefits under the Seller Pension Plans to the Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees and Non-U.S. Former Employees whose benefits are transferred. From
and after the date of such applicable transfer of the Pension Transfer
Amounts, Buyers and their Affiliates agree to indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any and all costs, damages,
losses, expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the
provision of such benefits to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and Non-U.S.
Former Employees whose benefits under the Seller Pension Plans are
transferred to the Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plans.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.4_ , in the
event there is no transfer of Assets to the Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plans,
nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_  will result in a duplication of
benefits for any Pension Plan Employees or Pension Plan Former Employees.

  



  

(h) In respect of the UK Pension Plan, Sellers will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) procure that the provision of Transfer Credits
under the relevant Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plan referred to in _Section
7.4(a)_ , the transfer of Assets referred to in _Section 7.4(b)_ and the
assumption of Liabilities by the Non-U.S. Buyer Pension Plans referred to in
_Section 7.4(b)_ will enable a relevant transfer deduction to apply to the
liability share of Pharma Healthcare Limited ("relevant transfer deduction"
and "liability share" each having the meaning given in the UK Occupational
Pension Schemes (Employer Debt) Regulations 2005) so as to reduce to zero any
debt payable by Pharma Healthcare Limited to the UK Pension Plan under
section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995

  



        
   

  



  

(the " _Section 75 Debt_ "), or (ii) if (i) above is not possible or is not
sufficient to reduce the Section 75 Debt to zero, to procure that the
trustees of the UK Pension Plan will enter into an arrangement (including a
scheme apportionment arrangement or approved withdrawal arrangement under the
UK Occupational Pension Schemes (Employer Debt) Regulations 2005) so as to
ensure that any Liability of Pharma Healthcare Limited to the UK Pension Plan
under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 is assumed by another Seller
entity. Buyers agree to take all reasonable steps to assist Sellers to
achieve (i) and/or (ii), including procuring that Pharma Healthcare Limited
will execute such documents or give such notice to the trustees of the UK
Pension Plan as may be necessary to achieve (i) and/or (ii), and that Sellers
will have conduct of all discussions with such trustees on behalf of Pharma
Healthcare Limited in respect of the above steps and arrangements and the
calculation and payment of any Section 75 Debt.

  



  

 **Section 7.5 ****_Non-U.S. Defined Contribution Plans_** **.**

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyers or their Affiliates will establish or
designate defined contribution plans (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. Buyer DC
Plans_ ") for the benefit of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees who
participated in one or more of the defined contribution plans (other than a
stand-alone plan that is sponsored by a Sold Company and covers primarily
Business Employees) maintained by Sellers or their Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing outside the United States (collectively, the " _Non-U.S.
Seller DC Plans_ "). Such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees are referred to
hereinafter as the " _DC Employees_ ". Each Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plan will target
the same benefit value as, provide a benefit design that is equivalent to,
provide employer contribution formulas and provisions that are equivalent in
value to the employer contribution formulas and provisions in, and where
applicable offer a range of investment options that is similar to that
provided under, each corresponding Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan as of the Closing.
Buyers will procure that such Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plan will maintain such
arrangements and such benefits provisions for DC Employees for a period of at
least twelve months immediately following the Closing. The DC Employees will
be given credit under the respective Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plan for all service
with and compensation from Sellers or their Affiliates as if it were service
with and compensation from Buyers and their Affiliates for purposes of
determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit
accruals under each respective Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plan.

  



  

(b) With respect to a Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan, Sellers will cause the
transfer under each such Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan to the corresponding
Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plan of Assets equal to the actual account balances of the
DC Employees under each such Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan as of the Closing or
such greater amount as is required by the applicable regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over the Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan in order to obtain
approval of such transfer (the " _DC Transfer Amount_ "). The transfer of the
DC Transfer Amounts will be subject to such consents, approvals and other
legal requirements as may apply under applicable Law. Buyers and their
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the DC Transfer
Amounts to be accepted by such Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plans.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) The DC Transfer Amounts to be transferred, if any, from the respective
Non-U.S. Seller DC Plans will be equitably adjusted to take into account
benefit payments made from the respective Non-U.S. Seller DC Plans to the DC
Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer and for any
investment returns of the Non-U.S. Seller DC Plans allocated to the DC
Employees accounts during such period. The transfer of the DC Transfer Amount,
if any, will take place within 180 days after the date of Closing.

  



  

(d) At the times of the transfers of the DC Transfer Amounts, Buyers and
their Affiliates and the Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plans will assume all Liabilities
with respect to or relating to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees under the
applicable Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan and Sellers and their Affiliates and the
Non-U.S. Seller DC Plans will be relieved of all such Liabilities under such
Non-U.S. Seller DC Plan with respect to the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees.
From and after the date of the transfer of the DC Transfer Amount, Buyers and
their Affiliates agree to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their
Affiliates from and against any and all costs, damages, losses, expenses, or
other Liabilities arising out of or related to the Non-U.S. Transferred
Employees under the applicable Non-U.S. Seller DC Plans.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.5_ , in the
event there is no transfer of Assets to the Non-U.S. Buyer DC Plans, nothing
contained in this _Section 7.5_  will result in a duplication of benefits for
any DC Employee.

  



  

 **Section 7.6 _Deferred Closing Jurisdictions._**  For purposes of this
_Article 7_ , in respect of any jurisdiction where there is a Deferred Local
Closing, (a) subject to clause (d) below, Buyers and Sellers and their
Affiliates will mutually agree in good faith on appropriate arrangements to
continue the Sellers compensation and employee benefits (including statutory
arrangements) for the Business Employees as of the Closing (unless otherwise
agreed by Buyers or required by applicable Law), at the expense of Buyers,
until the date of the Deferred Local Closing or such other date as may be
agreed upon by Buyers and Sellers and their Affiliates, (b) except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law, Business Employees in any
jurisdiction where there is a Deferred Local Closing will not
become Transferred Employees until the Deferred Local Closing, (c) any
Pension Transfer Amount and any DC Transfer Amount, or any assets transferred
under _Section 7.2(d)_ , will be determined as of the date that title to the
assets is transferred, in the same manner as provided in _Sections 7.2(d),
7.4_ and _7.5_ , respectively, and, subject to such consents, approvals and
other legal requirements as may apply under applicable Law, Sellers and their
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of
any Pension Transfer Amount, any DC Transfer Amount and any assets
transferred under _Section 7.2(d)_ to take place within 180 days of the
applicable Deferred Local Closing, in each case after taking into account
adjustments for earnings, gains/losses and benefit payments after the
applicable Deferred Local Closing but prior to the date of transfer, in the
same manner as provided in _Sections 7.2(d), 7.4_ and _7.5_ , respectively,
and (d) any required adjustments to implement this _Article 7_ with respect
to such jurisdiction, including in respect of the timing and manner of
payments between Sellers, Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates, will
be set forth in the business

in respect of Business Employees, Former Employees and consultants (other

Buyers a revised _Schedule 3.17(a)_. Upon Buyers approval of any
Business Employees added to _Schedule 3.17(a)_ , which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, such list will be the definitive list of
Business Employees for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 7.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, will be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Seller Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, Seller U.S. Benefit Plan or any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyers or any of their

Sellers, Buyers and the Sold Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Seller Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
Seller U.S. Benefit Plan, Buyers Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement following the Closing Date, provided the provisions of

representation or warranty will be disregarded.

  



  

(b) _Limitations on Buyer Parent s Indemnity_.

  



  

(i) Buyer Parent will not be required to indemnify the Sellers Indemnified
Parties with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or
relating to matters described in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_  (x) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all such claims against the Sellers Indemnified
Parties for such matters exceeds the Deductible, in which event the Sellers
Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover for the full amount of the
Losses, (y) with respect to individual matters involving Losses of less than
the Deminimis Amount, which individual Losses less than the Deminimis Amount
**** will not be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible, or (z) to the
extent the aggregate amount of such claims exceeds the Cap; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the Deductible, Deminimis Amount and Cap and will not apply
for any claim for indemnification arising out of or relating to a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_ (Organization),
_Section 4.2_  (Authorization; Enforceability), _Section 4.3_ (No Conflicts
or Approval) and _Section 4.5_ (No Brokers) for which claims Buyer Parent
will be required to indemnify the Sellers Indemnified Parties for aggregate
amounts up to the amount of the Purchase Price.

  



  

(ii) Buyer Parent will not have Liability to Sellers for any consequential,
incidental, special or punitive damages, and Losses indemnifiable hereunder
will not include such damages except to the extent (A) Sellers are required
to pay such amount to a third party in respect to a final judgment or order
obtained by the third party or (B) in the event of fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

  



  

 **Section 11.3 ****_Notice and Defense of Claims; Settlements; Expenses_**
**.**

  



  

(a) The indemnified Party will promptly notify the indemnifying Party in
writing of all matters which may give rise to the right to indemnification
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to timely give the notice
provided in this _Section 11.3_ will not be a defense to the Liability of the
indemnifying Party for such claim, but the indemnifying Party may recover any
actual damages arising from the indemnified Partys failure to give such
timely notice.

  



  

(b) In connection with any claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder resulting
from or arising out of any claim or legal proceeding by a Person other than
the indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") the indemnifying Party at
its sole cost and expense may, after acknowledging in writing its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified Party hereunder and upon written notice to the
indemnified Party received by the indemnified Party within fourteen (14) days
after the indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of such claim, assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof.
 If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, the indemnifying Party will select its own counsel to conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim (which must be reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified Party)

  



        
   

  



  

and, at the indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense (which costs and
expenses will not be applied against any indemnity limitation herein), will
take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof.
The indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in (but not control)
the defense of any such action, with its own counsel and at its own expense,
and will be entitled to any and all information and documentation relating
thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , the expense of the indemnified Partys
counsel will be borne by the indemnifying Party if the interests of the
indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to the applicable
Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by
the same counsel of both Parties under applicable Law, ethical rules or
equitable principles. If the indemnifying Party does not assume (or continue
to diligently and competently prosecute) the defense of any such Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the indemnified Party may, at the
indemnifying Partys expense, defend against such Third Party Claim in
such manner as it may deem appropriate. The indemnified Party will cooperate
reasonably with the indemnifying Party in its efforts to conduct or resolve
such matters, including by making available to the indemnifying Party
relevant documents and witnesses. The indemnified Party (regardless of
whether the indemnifying Party acknowledges an obligation to indemnify the
indemnified Party with respect to the matter in question) and the
indemnifying Party will keep each other informed of all settlement
negotiations with third parties and of the progress of any litigation with
third parties. The indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party will permit
each other reasonable access to books and records and will otherwise
cooperate with all reasonable requests of each other in connection with any
indemnifiable matter resulting from a claim by a third Person.

  



  

(c) The indemnified Party will not admit any Liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  



  

(d) With respect to any Third Party Claims relating solely to the payment of
money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result
in the indemnified Partys or its Affiliates becoming subject to injunctive
or other relief or otherwise adversely affecting the business of the
indemnified Party or its Affiliates in any manner, and as to which the
indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify
the indemnified Party thereunder, the indemnifying Party will have the sole
right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or
otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in
its sole discretion, deems appropriate).

  



  

(e) Except as provided above, the costs and expenses, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, incurred by the indemnified Party in connection
with any Third Party Claim will be reimbursed on a calendar quarter basis by
the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Partys right
to contest the indemnified Partys right to indemnification and subject to
refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be
obligated to indemnify the indemnified Party.

  



  

 **Section 11.4 ****_Knowledge of Breach_** **. **It is expressly agreed by
the Parties that the indemnification provided by _Section 11.1_ or _Section
11.10_ will apply in the case of

  



        
   

  



  

any breach of any representation or warranty of any Seller contained in
this Agreement without regard to any Knowledge of Buyers of the facts giving
rise to such prior to the Closing, other than as set forth in _Section 3.26_
with respect to information disclosed in the Data Room.

  



  

 **Section 11.5 ****_Other Limitations_** **.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Losses will
not include any damages to the extent attributable to a failure to mitigate
damages after the indemnified Party becomes aware of the event or omission
which caused such damages.

  



  

(b) No Liability will arise in respect of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement herein to the extent that Liability for such
breach occurs (or is increased) directly or indirectly as a result of any
retrospective application of a change in applicable Law, or in accounting
policies, procedures or practices, announced or, if not announced in advance
of taking effect, taking effect, after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Any Liability for any indemnification for any Losses pursuant to this
_Article 11_ will be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the stated facts giving rise to such Loss which constitute a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

  



  

(d) All amounts paid by Seller Parent or Buyer Parent under this _Article 11_
will be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price except for Tax purposes
only to the extent such treatment is permitted by the applicable Tax Law.
In the event that treatment as an adjustment to the Purchase Price is
disputed by any Tax Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute
will promptly notify and consult with the other Party concerning resolution
of such dispute. If any Tax Authority imposes any tax on any amount paid to
any Buyers Indemnified Party under this _Section 11.1_ , then the amount so
payable will be grossed up by such amount as will ensure that after payment
of such tax there will be left a sum equal to the amount which would
otherwise be payable under this _Section 11.1_.

  



  

 **Section 11.6 ****_Survival_** **.**

  



  

(a) Any indemnification obligations of the parties with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1_ (Organization),
_Section 3.2_ (Authorization; Enforceability), _Section 3.3_ (No Conflicts or
Approval), _Section 3.4_ (Capital Stock of the Sold Companies), _Section 3.5_

P.M. (Eastern time) on the date that is the seven (7) year anniversary of the
Closing Date (except that if a claim for indemnification has been made prior
to such time with respect to the breach of such Tax representation or
warranty or Tax matters, such claim will remain outstanding until the earlier
of the final resolution thereof).

  



  

(c) Other than with respect to those representations and warranties whose
survival period is set forth in _Section 11.6(a) or 11.6(b)_ , all
indemnification obligations with respect to the representations and
warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement will be extinguished at
5:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date that is the 24-month anniversary of the

to such time with respect to the breach of any representation or warranty,
such claim will remain outstanding until the earlier of the final resolution
thereof).

  



  

(d) All indemnification obligations with respect to the Special
Indemnification Matters and Environmental Remediation Costs will be
extinguished at 5:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date that is the five (5)
year anniversary of the Closing Date (except that if a claim
for indemnification or remediation payments has been made prior to such time
with respect to a Special Indemnification Matter, such claim will remain
outstanding until the earlier of the final resolution thereof).

  



  

(e) Any indemnification obligations of the Parties with respect to breaches
of any covenants of this Agreement will survive the Closing Date in
accordance with their terms (and if such terms do not express any survival
period, will survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant matter).

  



  

(f) Any indemnification obligations of Seller Parent with respect to the
LaBounty Indemnification will survive the Closing Date until the earlier of:
(i) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
the LaBounty Indemnification or (ii) the termination of the LaBounty
Indemnification in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.29_.

  



  

 **Section 11.7 ****_Exclusive Remedy_** **.**  Following the Closing, absent
willful concealment or fraud, except with respect to matters covered by
_Section 2.9_ , (a) claims pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_ , _Section 7.2(e)_ ,
_Section 7.2(f)_ and this _Article 11_  and (b) claims for specific
performance of the covenants and obligations of the other Party under this
Agreement will, collectively, be the sole and exclusive remedies for claims
and damages available to Sellers and Buyers and arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any certificate or document delivered in connection
herewith and all other rights and remedies (whether at Law or equity) are
hereby expressly waived.

  



  

 **Section 11.8 ****_Net Losses and Subrogation_** **.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by the indemnified Party will be calculated
after giving effect to (i) any net insurance proceeds received by the
indemnified Party and any of its Affiliates with respect to such Losses, and
(ii) any net amounts recovered by the indemnified Party and any of its
Affiliates from any other third Person. Each

  



        
   

  



  

indemnified Party will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such proceeds or recoveries either prior or subsequent to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement. If any such proceeds or recoveries are
received by an indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
Losses after the indemnified Party has received the benefit of
any indemnification hereunder with respect thereto, the indemnified Party
will pay to the indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds or recoveries,
up to the amount of the Indemnifying Partys payment.

  



  

(b) Upon making any payment to an indemnified Party in respect of any Losses
under this _Article 11_ , the indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified Party and its
Affiliates against any third Party in respect of the Losses to which such
payment relates. Such indemnified Party and its Affiliates and indemnifying
Party will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.

  



  

 **Section 11.9 _Net of Taxes_. ** The Seller will not be liable to indemnify
any Losses up to the amount (if any) by which any Tax for which the Buyers or
any of their Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sold
Companies) would otherwise have been accountable or liable to be assessed is
reduced by such Loss in the year in which the Loss occurred or any taxable
year following such year provided that no such Tax effect will be applied if
the Buyer or its relevant Affiliate that suffered the Loss has or, in the
reasonable opinion of the Buyer Parent, will not have any profits in the
foreseeable future that can or could compensate the Loss.

  



  

 **Section 11.10 ****_Tax Indemnity_** **.**

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.4_ , _Section 11.5_ ,
_Section 11.8 and 11.9,_  Seller Parent agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyers Indemnified Parties against all Losses for Taxes of the
Business, Sellers or their Affiliates or the Sold Companies (i) for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period that begins on or before the Closing Date and

6.3(c)_.

  



  

(b) The Sellers will not be liable to provide indemnification under _Section
11.10(a)_ to the extent that:

  



  

(i) any Tax Liability has already been taken into account for calculations of
the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ;

  



  

(ii) the Liability giving rise to the claim was paid or discharged at or
before the Closing;

  



  

(iii) except for elections permitted under _Section 6.6_ , the liability
giving rise to the claim is attributable to (A) an action or omission by the
Buyers, their transferee or their Affiliates after the Closing (other than an
action or omission expressly required by Law in force on the Closing Date),
(B) an action or omission by a Sellers or their

  



         
 

  



  

Affiliates before the Closing at the express written direction of the Buyers
or (C) a breach by the Buyers, their transferee or their Affiliates of any
obligation under this Agreement;

  



  

(iv) (A) relief is available to a Buyer or a Sold Company (including relief
under an insurance policy), (B) relief would have been available to the

the Sellers Indemnified Parties against any and all Taxes imposed on any of
the Sold Companies, which Taxes are not subject to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 11.10(a)_ , including any and all Taxes with respect to any
taxable period that begins after the Closing Date and that are imposed on any
of the Sold Companies or with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period
that begins after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ").

  



  

(d) Payment by the indemnitor of any amounts due under this _Section 11.10_
will be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the indemnitee
that (i) payment of such amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority is due
(whether or not there has been a final determination with respect to such
Tax) or (ii) in any other circumstance, that the Loss has been incurred but
no earlier than five (5) Business Days before the date when the relevant
Taxes must be paid to a Taxing Authority.

  



  

(e) Seller Parent will be required to indemnify the Buyers Indemnified
Parties with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of or
relating to the matters set forth under _Section 11.10(a)_ for aggregate
amounts up to the amount of the Purchase Price.

  



  

(f) If the facts underlying a matter would constitute a breach of the Tax
representation contained in _Section 3.15_  and in addition would be
indemnified under _Section 11.10(a)_ , any indemnification obligations for
Losses arising from such breach would be determined pursuant to Sellers
indemnification obligations under _Section 11.10(a)_  without any duplication
of recovery.

  



  

(g) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 11.10_ will be made to the
appropriate Seller or Buyer and will constitute an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  



  

 **Section 11.11 ****_Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_** **.**

indemnity payment to any of the Buyers Indemnified Parties pursuant to
_Section 11.10(a)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ ")

  



        
   

  



  

Buyers will promptly notify Sellers in writing of such Tax Claim ****
stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the
extent known by Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve Sellers of its
obligations hereunder only to the extent that such failure prejudices Sellers
hereunder.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, with respect to
any Tax Claim described in _Section 11.11(a)_  other than relating to a
Straddle Period, Sellers will, at their own expense, control all Proceedings

accountants) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in their sole
discretion pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, Proceedings,
hearings, audits and conferences with any Tax Authority with respect thereto
and may contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Sellers will not take or advocate any position that
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyers or their
Affiliates (including the Sold Companies) without first consulting with
Buyers regarding such position or take any action with respect to such Tax
Claim that would legally bind the Buyers without the prior written consent of
Buyers and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Sellers will afford Buyers the
opportunity to participate, as may reasonably be requested by Buyers, with
Sellers in contesting any Tax Claim. Buyers will have the right, at their
expense, to control any other Tax claim.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 12**

  

 ** **

  

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

  



  

 **Section 12.1 ****_Assignment_** **.**  Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise
transferred by any Party without the prior written consent of Seller Parent
(in the case of the Buyers) and Buyer Parent (in the case of the Sellers),
which will not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported assignment
in violation of the preceding sentence will be void and of no effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Buyer Parent may, without the consent of
the Seller Parent, assign its rights and obligations, in whole or in part,
under this Agreement to one or more of its controlled Affiliates, except that
no such assignment will relieve the Buyer Parent from the performance of its
obligations hereunder, and (b) a Buyer, without the consent of the Seller
Parent, may assign its right to purchase the Shares, Acquired Assets or any
of its other rights or any portion thereof hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of such Buyer or in connection with a sale, merger or other
transaction involving a transfer of substantially all of its assets,
_provided_ , that such assignment will not relieve any Buyer of
its obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **Section 12.2 ****_No Public Announcements_** **.** Except for the initial
press releases to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ , which will be released by
Buyer Parent and Seller Parent following the execution of this Agreement,
neither Party will issue or make any public announcement, press release or
other public disclosure regarding this Agreement or its subject matter
without the other Partys prior written consent, except for any such
disclosure that is required by Law or the rules of a stock exchange on which
the securities

  



        
   

  



  

of the disclosing Party (or its Affiliates) are listed. In the event a Party
is, in the opinion of its counsel, required to make a public disclosure by
Law or the rules of a stock exchange on which its securities are listed, such
Party will, to the extent practicable, submit the proposed disclosure in
writing to the other Party prior to the date of disclosure and provide the
other Party reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

  



  

 **Section 12.3 ****_Confidentiality_** **. **Sellers will, and will cause
their directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates to, keep the
Confidential Information (as defined below) confidential, and to use
Confidential Information exclusively for the purpose of this Agreement, for a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, except that any Confidential
Information required by Law or legal or administrative process to be
disclosed may be disclosed consistent with the provisions of this _Section
12.3_. For purposes hereof, the term " _Confidential Information_ " means (a)
all proprietary information that constitutes a trade secret relating
primarily to the Business, (b) information of a confidential nature submitted
by Buyers to Sellers, whether in written or oral form, and (c) the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, but in each case excluding any such information
that is available to the public on the Closing Date or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
_Section 12.3_ , or which is developed after the Closing Date by Sellers
independently of and without reference to any Confidential Information, or
which is obtained from third parties without breach by such third parties of
any confidentiality obligation. The foregoing covenant will not prevent
Sellers from disclosing Confidential Information as required by Law or in
response to the order of a court or Governmental Authority, _provided_ that
Sellers promptly notifies Buyers prior to such disclosure.

  



  

 **Section 12.4 ****_Expenses_** **.**  Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, Sellers and Buyers will pay all of their own fees, costs and
expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of investment bankers, legal
counsel, accountants and other representatives and consultants) incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

 **Section 12.5 ****_Severability_** **.**  Each of the provisions contained
in this Agreement will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not
affect the enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this
Agreement.  If the invalidity of any provisions of this Agreement creates any
gaps, or if they otherwise exist herein, the Parties agree that such
invalidity or gap will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. The Parties will replace an invalid provision or fill any
gap with valid provisions which most closely approximate the purpose and
economic effect of the invalid provision or, in case of a gap, the Parties
presumed intentions. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
materially altered as a result of the preceding sentences, the Parties
will renegotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to
resolve any inequities. Nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted so as
to require either Party to violate any applicable Laws.

amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in
writing signed by all of

transactions covered hereby, superseding all negotiations, prior discussions
and preliminary agreements, whether written or oral, made prior to the date
of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 12.7 ****_No Third Party Beneficiaries_** **.**  Except as
provided under _Article 11_ with respect to Sellers Indemnified Parties and
Buyers Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is solely for the benefit of the
Parties hereto and no provision of this Agreement will be deemed to confer
upon third parties any remedy, claim, Liability, reimbursement, claim of
action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this
Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 12.8 ****_Waiver_** **.**  Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, which may be lawfully waived, may be waived in writing at any time
by each Party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of
any of the provisions of this Agreement by any Party hereto will be binding
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to or
will constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor will such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver.

  



  

 **Section 12.9 ****_Governing Law_** **.**  This Agreement will be governed
by and will be construed in accordance with the Laws of Belgium without
regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

  



  

 **Section 12.10 _Arbitration_. **All controversies, disputes or claims

will commence to run from the date of receipt of the notice by the addressee
thereof, as evidence by the return receipt. Rejection or other refusal by

address by notice to the others, then to the last address so designated.

  



  

 **Section 12.15 _No Other Compensation_.**  Each Party hereby agrees and
acknowledges that the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
fully define all consideration, compensation and benefits, monetary or
otherwise to be paid, granted or delivered to or by Sellers or to or by
Buyers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

 **Section 12.16 ****_Enforcement of Agreement_** **.**  Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be irreparably damaged if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by a Seller or
Buyers could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages
alone.  Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any
Party may be entitled at law or in equity, it will be entitled to enforce
any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and
to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without
posting any bond or other undertaking.

  



  

 **Section 12.17 ****_Exhibits and Schedules_** **.**  All Exhibits and
Schedules referenced herein are incorporated herein by reference and are a
part of this Agreement for all purposes. The Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare, agree upon and complete the Schedules listed
in _Schedule 12.17_ with fifteen (15) days from the date hereof. Without
prejudice to the undertaking in the preceding sentence, the Parties
acknowledge that none of such schedules listed in _Schedule 12.17_ are so
essential that failure to reach agreement on their contents may form a basis
for rescission of this Agreement. Each page of the Agreement, Exhibits and
Schedules, other than the last signature page of the Agreement, will be
initialed, for identification purposes, by the Seller Parent and the Buyer
Parent. Acknowledging that Seller Parent and its Affiliates that are a party
to this Agreement, on the one hand, and Buyer Parent and its Affiliates that
are a party to this Agreement have the same economic interests under this
Agreement, the Parties agree that only the pages, other than the last
signature page, of the Agreements, Exhibits and Schedules delivered to Seller
Parent and delivered to Buyer Parent will carry original initials, while the
pages of the Agreements, Schedules and Exhibits delivered to the other
Parties may carry photocopies of such initials. Seller Parent herewith
authorizes, with the right of substitution, Otto Grolig and Geert Verhoeven,
to initial on its behalf, all pages of the Agreement, Exhibits and Schedules.
Buyer Parent herewith authorizes, with the right of substitution, Thomas J.
Dee to initial, on its behalf, all pages of the Agreement, Exhibits and
Schedules.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective duly authorized officers as of the date first
above written.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill.,  Sept. 28, 2009  Abbott today announced a definitive
agreement with the  Solvay Group for Abbott to acquire Solvays
pharmaceuticals business for EUR  4.5 billion ($6.6 billion) in cash,
providing Abbott with a large and  complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical
products and a significant presence  in key global emerging markets. The
acquisition also includes full global rights to the  fenofibrate franchise.
Currently Abbott has U.S. rights to fenofibrate and  pays royalties to
Solvay.

    |  

Belgium-based  Solvay Pharmaceuticals will add more than $3 billion in annual
sales, the  majority outside the U.S. Solvay has significant presence and
infrastructure  in key high-growth emerging markets, including Eastern Europe
and Asia.  Emerging markets are growing faster and increasing in importance
due to  demographics, rising incomes and expanded treatment of chronic
disease.

    |  



    |  

The  acquisition will also add approximately $500 million to Abbotts
annual  pharmaceutical RandD investment, providing Abbott with the opportunity
to  further accelerate near and long-term pharmaceutical growth.

    |  

"The acquisition of  Solvay Pharmaceuticals further diversifies our
pharmaceutical portfolio,  expands our presence in key high-growth emerging
markets, enhances our  investment in RandD and accelerates our long-term
earnings-per-share growth  outlook," said Miles D. White, chairman and chief
executive officer, Abbott.

"In anticipation of future market needs, we are ensuring we have the
technologies, products, infrastructure and reach to serve patients globally
and continue to deliver sustainable industry-leading growth.  This
acquisition, as well as the others weve announced this year all
contribute to achieving that long-term goal," said Mr. White.

  



  

"With this transaction Solvay Pharmaceuticals has found a new strong home,
within a respected company with a solid and committed position in the
industry," comments Christian Jourquin, chief executive officer, Solvay.

  



  

Solvays pharmaceutical portfolio complements Abbotts presence and expertise
in specialty markets such as cardiovascular disease, neuroscience and
gastroenterology.  Solvay has treatments for Parkinsons disease, Menieres
disease (abnormality of the inner ear), vertigo, and irritable bowel
syndrome.  Solvay also offers products to treat mens and womens hormonal
health, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (inability to properly digest
food), which is associated with several underlying conditions including
cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.

  



  

The acquisition also includes Solvays vaccines business, which will provide
Abbott entry into the expanding global vaccines market. Solvay has a small
molecular diagnostics unit that will become part of Abbotts diagnostics
organization upon the transaction close.

  



  

"Abbotts international pharmaceutical business has grown significantly over
the past several years, driven by specialty products in developed markets,"
said Olivier Bohuon, executive vice president, Pharmaceutical Products Group,
Abbott. "In emerging markets where chronic disease is being treated more
aggressively, the combined Abbott and Solvay portfolio of branded generics
expands the global reach of these medicines. Solvays business will also give
us a platform to enter the attractive global vaccines market."

  



  

 **Financial Highlights**

  

The transaction will be approximately $0.10 accretive to ongoing earnings per
share in 2010, accelerating to more than $0.20 by 2012, increasing
thereafter, all before one-time transaction-related items, which will be

 ** _SOLVAY OPTS FOR STRATEGIC REFOCUS OF ACTIVITIES_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

 ** _Decision to sell Pharmaceuticals Sector to Abbott_**

  



  

Solvay today announces that its Board of Directors has decided to refocus the
activities of the Solvay Group in order to accelerate the implementation of
its sustainable and profitable growth strategy and to sell its entire
pharmaceutical business to Abbott for a total Entreprise Value of about EUR
5.2 billion. This includes a purchase price of EUR 4.5 billion in cash and
additional potential payments of up to EUR 300 million if certain milestones
are met between 2011 and 2013. It also includes the assumption of
certain liabilities, which Solvay today values at approximately EUR 400
million. This decision is the outcome of the thorough and in-depth analysis
and evaluation of the different strategic options for the Pharmaceuticals
Sector.

  



  

In addition, the transaction provides for the transfer of all employees of
the pharmaceutical business with their current employment conditions; it also
includes customary provisions limiting future exposure of Solvay to
its former pharmaceutical activities. This transaction is expected to be
closed in the first quarter 2010, pending the approval by the relevant
competition authorities. Solvay will communicate the impact of the
transaction on its results when finalized.

  



  

After closing of the transaction, Solvay will reinvest the proceeds
in organic and sizeable external growth, focused on long term value creation.
This will be done by investing in high value-added activities and strategic
projects in chemicals and plastics, by continuing the geographical expansion
into regions with growth potential and by continuing the development of
activities and new products with low energy footprint and which significantly
reduce the cyclicality in Solvays portfolio of activities. Studies about
such reinvestments are ongoing.

  



  

"The Board has chosen to give all activities of the Group, Pharmaceuticals
and non-Pharmaceuticals, the best possibilities for their future development,
and this in the interest of all stakeholders involved", says Alois
Michielsen, Chairman of Solvays Board of Directors. "We are building a new
refocused Group on todays strong foundations, with the financial means to
further accelerate sustainable growth. Our philosophy is unaltered: realizing
sustained growth with leading positions and stick to a conservative financial
structure. The proceeds from the divestment will be reinvested in external
and organic growth with a sharp focus on long term value creation", adds
Christian Jourquin, Chief Executive Officer of Solvay.

  



  

"The acquisition by Abbott is an acknowledgment of the performance of the
Pharmaceuticals Sector and the strengths and competences of its
employees. The Sector will further reinforce Abbott as a leading company in
its industry", comments Werner Cautreels, Group General Manager of the
Pharmaceuticals Sector. 

  



  

Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild served as financial advisors to
Solvay on this transaction.
