and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate shall, subject to Section
5.08, by virtue of or in connection with the Merger, be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter further amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Company Bylaws shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that all references therein to Merger Sub
shall be automatically amended and shall become references to the
Surviving Corporation and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

(d) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



\- 2 - (e) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

 

Section 1.02 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on a
date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be
no later than the third International Business Day after satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California
94303, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may agree to in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any case,
the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

 

Section 1.03 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

 

(a) Promptly, and in any event within 10 Business Days, after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy
materials for the Special Meeting (together with any amendments and
supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement. Subject to
Section 5.03(d) and Section 5.03(e), the Company shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall also include
the Fairness Opinion (in its entirety) in the Proxy Statement together with a
summary thereof. Parent shall provide promptly to the Company such
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 



\- 3 - (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.03(a), prior to filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement, a definitive Proxy Statement or any Other Filing
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
each such filing in advance, and the Company shall include in such filing all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent in respect of such filings, except to
the extent such disclosures relate to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or written comments
from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review) and of
any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or any Other Filing or for additional or supplemental information
in connection therewith. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the receipt of such comments from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement or any such Other Filing (i) supply Parent
with copies of all written correspondence received in connection therewith and
(ii) provide Parent a reasonably detailed description of any oral comments
received in connection therewith. The Company (1) shall provide Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any responses to comments
or inquiries by the SEC with respect to any filings related to the
Transactions, (2) shall include in such response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent in respect of the filings, except to the extent such
comments relate to an Acquisition Proposal, (3) shall not file or mail such
document, or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (4) shall
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in
any discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff with respect to such
filings. The Company shall respond in good faith to any comments by the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent shall provide its comments to
the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) If the Company: (i) does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file definitive proxy
materials (including the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company
on or prior to the third Business Day after the expiration of the
10-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) does receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file definitive proxy materials
(including the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company on
or prior to the third Business Day immediately following clearance by the SEC
with respect to such comments.

 

(d) If, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting, any event or
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
Affiliates should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information to be filed with the SEC as promptly
as reasonably practicable thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



\- 4 - (e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 40 days after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement
to the stockholders of the Company, for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Special Meeting_ ") and (ii) subject to Section
5.03, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and secure the vote
or consent of the stockholders of the Company as required by the rules of
NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The Company
shall give Parent no less than 10 Business Days advance notice (or such
shorter period of time as notice is provided to NASDAQ) of the date which
shall be set as the "record date" for the Special Meeting. The Company shall
consult with Parent regarding the date of the Special Meeting and shall not
change the record date or postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the Company may, following
reasonable consultation with Parent, adjourn the Special Meeting (i) to the
extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement that the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, reasonably determines is necessary to comply with applicable Law, is
made available to the Companys stockholders in advance of the Special
Meeting, (ii) to the extent that, as of the time that the Special Meeting
is originally scheduled, adjournment of the Special Meeting is necessary to
enable the Company to solicit additional proxies required to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting and to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company may, and if so requested by
Parent shall, adjourn the Special Meeting in order to provide for the
expiration of any time period provided for in Section 5.03(d) or Section
5.03(e).

 

(f) The Company shall ensure that the Special Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in connection
with the Special Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Law. The adoption of this Agreement and adjournment of the
Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall be the
only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting, unless otherwise approved
in writing by Parent.

 

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
(i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting shall not be affected by any Change of Board Recommendation and (ii)
its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.01, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior
to the vote of the stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger at
the Special Meeting.

 

(h) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, voting power in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or
provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other stockholder approvals that are required
by applicable Law to effect the Merger.

to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five International Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent
or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares (other than holders of Dissenting Shares and Shares subject to Full
Value Awards) shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement as a
result of the occurrence of at the Effective Time and upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_
, in the event that such funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such
additional funds as are necessary to ensure that the Paying Agent has funds
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be
invested or otherwise held by

 



\- 6 -  the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole
discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of any such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably specify; and

 

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

(c) _Cancellation of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration_. Upon the
surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form in accordance with the instructions thereto, with
respect to such Certificates or an agents message in the case of a book
entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-
Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and

 



\- 7 -  thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

(e)  _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the nine month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available
to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.02(b), without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with Section 2.02(f). If, immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has
not complied with the procedures in Section 2.02(b) to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration or any other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options or shares subject
to Full Value Awards, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law,
including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by holder of
Shares, Company Options or shares subject to Full Value Awards. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, Parent shall pay (unless the Paying Agent is the entity
withholding such amounts, in which case, Parent shall instruct the Paying
Agent to pay) such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority and such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or shares subject to Full Value
Awards, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



\- 8 - (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.01(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any Action that may be made
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or
other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f). The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment (unless required by Law) with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for
Shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.

Section 2.04 _Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and
Company RSUs_. No later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall have taken all requisite action such that:

(a)  _Company Options_. Each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company
Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, within 21 days following
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company Option, and (y) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise
price under such Company Option. If the per share exercise price under any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.04(a) without
payment of consideration.

 



\- 9 - (b) _Treatment of Unvested Full Value Awards_. Each Share subject to a Company
RSU and each Share of Company Restricted Stock (each such award, a " _Full
Value Award_ ") that remains outstanding immediately prior to, and is not
vested and does not become vested at, the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration,
and such right shall remain subject to the time-based vesting (including any
"double-trigger" acceleration) terms that applied with respect to the
applicable Full Value Award immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
award agreement governing such Full Value Award (the " _Replacement Right_ ").
Each Replacement Right shall not vest or become payable by the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time and shall instead vest and become payable
by Parent on the date upon which the applicable Share subject to the Full
Value Award would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and other
conditions, including any "double-trigger" acceleration terms, set forth in
the award agreement governing such Full Value Award. If such terms and
conditions are not satisfied and vesting ceases to continue at any point after
the Effective Time, the holder of the Replacement Right shall have no right
to receive any payment in respect of the forfeited Replacement Right or the
original Full Value Award. Following the Effective Time, no Replacement Right
may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any
transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than to the Surviving
Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the payment to such
Person of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04(b).
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, each Full Value Award
held by a non-employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
not be assumed, converted or substituted for by Parent and shall instead be
cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by the Surviving
Corporation in respect of each Share subject to such Full Value Award in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a single
lump-sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 21 days)
following the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Treatment of Vested Company RSUs_. Each Share subject to a Company RSU
that is vested but not yet issued as of the Effective Time, or that becomes
vested at the Effective Time pursuant to the applicable award agreement, shall
not be assumed or substituted for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at
the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by the Surviving Corporation
in respect of each unissued Share subject to a Company RSU in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a single lump-sum payment
as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 21 days) following the
Effective Time.

 

Section 2.05 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Each current
"Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date of this
Agreement under the ESPP shall continue, and, except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.05, the Shares shall be issued to participants thereunder on
the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the
date of this Agreement as provided under, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, the ESPP. Any Offering Period in progress as of the Effective
Time shall be shortened, and the last day of each such Offering Period shall
be the second Business Day immediately preceding

 



\- 10 -  the Effective Time. Each then outstanding ESPP Purchase Right shall be
exercised automatically on the last day of such Offering Period.
Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, the
treatment in the Merger of any Shares under this provision shall be in
accordance with Section 2.01(a). The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending
the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05 and as are appropriate to avoid the
commencement of any new Offering Period thereunder at or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.06 _No Right to Equity Under Awards_. The parties agree that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option, Company RSU,
ESPP Purchase Right or any other equity-based awards shall have any right
hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07 _Notices; Board or Committee Resolutions_.

 

(a) To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated in
Section 2.04, the Company shall, at least 10 Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time, use its reasonable best efforts to provide notice,
in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to all holders of
outstanding Company Options and shares subject to Full Value Awards that are
subject to Section 2.04 and holders of ESPP Purchase Rights subject to
Section 2.05.

(b) Prior to or promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board
or any committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Option Plans shall
adopt resolutions, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, that (i)
terminate each Company Stock Option Plan effective as of or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) approve the transactions contemplated in Section
2.04 as valid under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award
agreements issued thereunder, (iii) approve the transactions contemplated in
Section 2.05 as valid under the terms of the ESPP and the award agreements
issued thereunder and further document that:

(A) the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04 are consistent with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued
thereunder;

 

(B) the transactions contemplated in Section 2.05 are valid under the terms of
the ESPP and the award agreements issued thereunder;

 

(C) Parents assumption of the obligation to pay any Replacement Rights that
vest pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 2.04(b) will result in Parent
substituting an equivalent award for each share subject to a Full Value Award
that becomes subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.04(b); and

 



\- 11 - (D) the consummation of the Merger will not accelerate the vesting of any
shares subject to Full Value Awards or Company Options that are exchanged for
Replacement Rights, except as (1) specifically provided by Section 2.04(a)
with respect to Company Options, (2) specifically provided by Section 2.04(b)
with respect to any such Full Value Awards held by non-employee directors of
the Company, or (3) specifically provided by the terms of the individual award
agreement documenting a Full Value Award between the holder of any Full Value
Award and the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is in effect on the date
of this Agreement.

Section 2.08 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding shares of Company Stock, at any time during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.08 shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") which identifies items of disclosure by
reference to a particular Section or subsection of this Agreement, as
applicable, or any other part of the Company Disclosure Schedule where it is
reasonably apparent based on the substance of such disclosure (without
reference to the contents of the documents referred to therein) or the context
in which such disclosure is made that such disclosure shall be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent a
concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, and has all requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted in all material respects, except with respect to the Company
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing (to the extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in the
case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 12 - (b) The Company has delivered or caused to be delivered to Parent and Merger
Sub true and complete copies of the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent
organizational or governing documents, of each material Company Subsidiary and
each Company Subsidiary that is not wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company. Each of such documents is in full force and effect. The Company
is not in violation of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, and the
Company Subsidiaries are not in violation in any material respect of their
respective organizational or governing documents.

complete list of each Company Subsidiary, together with the jurisdiction of
organization or formation of each Company Subsidiary and (ii) the directors
and officers of the Company and each material Company Subsidiary, as of the
date of this Agreement.

Section 3.02 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 195,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_
"). As of the close of business on September 16, 2014 (the " _Capitalization
Date_ "), there were 57,074,353 Shares issued and outstanding (with no shares
of Company Restricted Stock) and 2,440 Shares were held in treasury by the
Company. No shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.

 

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has no
shares of capital stock reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance, except

outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock Option Plans, (ii)
2,961,750 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the vesting of Company
RSUs under the Company Stock Option Plans, (iii) up to 180,000 Shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of outstanding ESPP Purchase
Rights under the ESPP, (iv) 3,095,332 Shares reserved for future awards under
the Company Stock Option Plans, (v) 5,491,882 Shares reserved for issuance
pursuant to the 2015 Notes, (vi) 5,491,882 Shares reserved for issuance

(c) All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and
were issued in compliance with applicable Law. All Shares subject to issuance
under any Company Options or Company RSUs and any Company Stock Option Plan,
the 2015 Notes, the 2015 Warrants, the 2018 Notes and the 2018 Warrants, upon
issuance prior to the Effective Time, if any, pursuant to the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,

of Company Restricted Stock as of the close of business on the Capitalization

plan) under which each Company Option, ESPP Purchase Right or Company RSU, as
the case may be, was granted and (vii) the number of holders of ESPP Purchase

an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the
Code. Each grant of a Company Option, Company RSU, award of Company Restricted
Stock and ESPP Purchase Right was properly approved by the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance in all
material respects with Law, recorded on the Companys financial statements in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects consistently applied, and were
validly issued, and no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward
dating" or similar practices with respect to the effective date of the grant.
Except for Company Options, Company RSUs, Company Restricted Stock and ESPP
Purchase Rights, there are no awards or rights outstanding under any of the
Company Stock Option Plans.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.02(b), there are no Contracts to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, including options, warrants,

requiring the registration for sale of or (E) granting any preemptive or
antidilutive rights with respect to, any Shares or other Equity Interests in
the Company. From the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the
Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock or other Equity
Interests except upon the exercise of Company Options and the settlement of
Company RSUs outstanding as of the close of business on the Capitalization
Date, or upon conversion of the 2015 Notes or exercise of the 2015 Warrants
outstanding on the Capitalization Date and except as permitted under Section
5.01.

(e) Section 3.02(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each
material Company Subsidiary and each Company Subsidiary that is not, directly
or indirectly, wholly-owned by the Company, as applicable: (i) its authorized
capital stock or other Equity Interests, (ii) the number of its outstanding
shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests and type(s) of such
outstanding shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests and (iii) the
record owner(s) thereof. Other than the outstanding shares of capital stock
of each Company Subsidiary, there are no other Equity Interests of any Company
Subsidiary.

 



\- 14 - (f) Except for the rights of the Company or a wholly-owned Company Subsidiary
in their capacity as a holder of the outstanding Equity Interests of a
Company Subsidiary, there are no Contracts of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, including options, warrants, debentures, notes or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is a party (i) relating to any Equity Interests of a
Company Subsidiary, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to

right of first refusal with respect to, (D) requiring the registration for
sale of, or (E) granting any preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect
to, any Equity Interests in a Company Subsidiary. Other than Equity Interests
that are owned by certain nominee equity holders as required by the applicable
Law of the jurisdiction of organization of such Company Subsidiaries (which
shares or other interests do not materially affect the Companys control of
such Company Subsidiaries), the Company or another Company Subsidiary owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, and all of
such Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and were issued in
compliance with applicable Law. Except for Equity Interests in the Company
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or
indirectly any Equity Interest in any Person, or has any obligation or has
made any agreement to acquire any such Equity Interest, to provide funds to,
or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person.

principal amount of the 2015 Notes.

 

(h) The conversion rate for the 2018 Notes is 9.5377 Shares per each $1,000
principal amount of the 2018 Notes.

 

Section 3.03 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby to which it is a party, and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the Transactions including the Merger (subject to
and assuming the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in connection
with the Merger). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, including the Merger,
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no stockholder
votes are necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions other than, with respect to the Merger, the Company Stockholder
Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Guarantor, constitutes a

 



\- 15 -  legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or in equity).

(b) The Company Board has (i) taken all appropriate actions so that, assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.05,
the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
will not apply with respect to, or as a result of, the execution of this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Merger, without any further action on the part of the
stockholders of the Company or the Company Board and (ii) subject to any

any ERISA Affiliate or any Company Benefit Plan fiduciary could be subject to
any material Liability (other than for routine benefit Liabilities) under the
terms of, or with respect to, such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Law, nor would negotiation or consummation of the

intended to

 



\- 23 -  be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is
so exempt. No fact or event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the
exempt status of any such trust. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Company Benefit Plan
intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a).

 

(e) There has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a transaction that is
exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan that could result in material Liability to the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. There have been no breaches
of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section

Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. Each Company Benefit Plan (other
than an employment, severance, change in control or other similar agreement
with an individual) can be unilaterally amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms by the
Company, a Company Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate, without material
Liability to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (other
than (A) Liability for ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in
a termination event or (B) Liability for benefits accrued as of the date of
such amendment, termination or discontinuation to the extent that either (x)
there are sufficient assets set aside in a trust or insurance Contract to
satisfy such Liability or (y) such Liability is reflected on the Most Recent
Balance Sheet). No Action is pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, is
any investigation pending or Action or investigation threatened, against or
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits
claims). None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
has any material Liability under Section 502 of ERISA. All contributions and
payments to such Company Benefit Plan are fully deductible under Sections 162
or 404 of the Code. No amount is subject to Tax as unrelated business taxable
income under Section 511 of the Code, and no excise tax could reasonably be
expected to be imposed upon the Company under Chapter 43 of the Code.

(f) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever (i) maintained a Company Benefit Plan that was subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or had any Liability with respect to such plan
or (ii) been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is subject to ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan
is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,
or is funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of
the Code or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(17) of the Code.

 

(g) With respect to any Contract or insurance policy providing funding for
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, there is no material Liability of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate in the nature of a
retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or other material
Liability, nor would there be any such material Liability if 

 



\- 24 -  such Contract or insurance policy was terminated on the date of this
Agreement, and neither any party to any such Contract nor any insurance
company issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship,
liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the Knowledge of the Company as of
the date of this Agreement, no such Actions with respect to any such insurer
are imminent.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event,
such as termination of employment) will (i) result in any compensatory payment
becoming due to any director or employee of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any of their respective Affiliates, or to
any Governmental Entity or other Person on behalf of any such director or
employee, from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any
of their respective Affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan,
(iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
benefits or (iv) result in the payment of any amount that, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, would not be deductible pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of
the Code) or Section 162(m) of the Code.

 

(i) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any retiree or
post-employment health, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits
(whether or not insured) to any Person. The Company, each Company Subsidiary
and each ERISA Affiliate are in material compliance with (i) the requirements
of the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and
the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, and any similar
state law and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations
(including the proposed regulations) thereunder.

(j) The Company does not maintain any Company Benefit Plans that are or may
reasonably be deemed to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code). No award granted under any of the
Company Stock Option Plans is or may reasonably be deemed to be a "non-
qualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or otherwise obligated
under, any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the gross-up of the Tax
imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Transactions will
not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events) constitute an event under any Company Benefit Plan or Contract that
would reasonably be expected to result in any payment of deferred
compensation which will not be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(k) All Foreign Employee Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained, operated and

fully transferable, alienable and licensable by the Company or its Affiliates

Company Subsidiaries of their respective businesses, including the design,
development, use, import, export, manufacture, licensing, sale, service
offering or other disposition of the Company Products has not infringed or
misappropriated the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, does not
infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property rights of any Person and
will not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person. The operation by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries of their
respective businesses does not constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under applicable Laws. Since October 1, 2011, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice from any Person (i)
claiming that such operation or any Company Product (A) infringes or
misappropriates the Intellectual Property rights of any third Person or (B)
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the applicable Laws

Software material to and embodied or incorporated in any Company Product where
such Dispute, if determined adversely, would or would reasonably be expected
to have a material and adverse effect on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Companys Knowledge, no Dispute has
been threatened, challenging the legality, validity, enforceability
or ownership of any Company Owned Intellectual Property or Software and to
the Companys Knowledge, there exists no basis that would give rise to such a
Dispute. Since October 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has initiated any lawsuits against any third Person based on allegations of
infringement of any Company Owned Intellectual Property.

notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to,
require the disclosure or delivery by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any other party acting on behalf of Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third party of any Company Source Code. Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, in and of itself, would reasonably be expected to result
in the release of any Company Source Code from escrow or an obligation to
grant rights to or deliver any Company Source Code to any third party.

respectively, in the absence of this Agreement or the Transactions, provided,

any Parent Subsidiary in the manner described in such clauses must be solely

maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect
compliance with such legislation. No investigation conducted pursuant to this
Section 5.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or limit any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished by the Company to Parent).

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
5.03(b), the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within 24 hours after
the receipt by the Company, notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt

Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution
draft of the relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements with the
Person making such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ")) and other material documents with respect to such Superior
Proposal (including any with respect to the financing thereof); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to, during the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent
shall not have, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, made a written
offer irrevocable during the portion of the Superior Proposal Notice Period
remaining after the submission of such offer that would, upon the Companys
acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent and that, after consideration of such
offer by the Company Board in good faith and After Consultation, results in
the Company Board determining that such Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



\- 56 - In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver
a new written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(d)(i) and to comply
with the requirements of this Section 5.03(d) with respect to such new written
notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the
four Business Days contemplated by Section 5.03(d)(i) above).

 

 __(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
and solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect
a Change of Board Recommendation prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval if the Company Board determines in good faith, After
Consultation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors  fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board may not effect
such a Change of Board Recommendation unless: __

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice
itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice
shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which
the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation; and

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (A) if requested
by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused the Company
Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer
necessary, and (B) Parent shall not have, during the Intervening Event Notice
Period remaining after the submission of such offer, made a written
offer irrevocable during the portion of the Intervening Event Notice Period
that would, upon the Companys acceptance thereof, be binding on Parent and
that, after due consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith
and After Consultation, results in the Company Board determining that it
would continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law to not effect the Change of
Board Recommendation.

 

In the event of any material changes to the circumstances applicable to the
Intervening Event, after the start of the Intervening Event Notice Period,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
pursuant to Section 5.03(e)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.03(e) with respect to such new written notice (including a new

shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days
contemplated by Section 5.03(e)(i) above).

 



\- 57 - (f) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed in any
Company SEC Documents.

 

(g) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Representative that,
if taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03 shall be deemed to be a material
breach of this Section 5.03 by the Company.

__(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or otherwise complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9;  _provided, however_ , that, except as otherwise
permitted under Section 5.03, such disclosure is limited to: (i) a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal, and/or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company
Board Recommendation. __

 

(i) No Change of Board Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company
Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to the
Transactions.

Section 5.04 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties with
respect to any Contracts of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as

consummation of the Transactions) as a result of the execution, performance or
consummation of the Transactions, including such consents as are required to

of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any Action by any Governmental
Entity (including those in connection with the Antitrust Laws and CFIUS
Approval), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger

 



\- 58 -  and the other Transactions. The Company and Parent shall further (x)
cooperate with each other in determining which additional filings, and which

date of this Agreement.

__(d) The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions and copies of all
filings made by any filing party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions; _provided, however_ , that materials provided by the
Company or Parent and their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the other
party may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
entered into in the ordinary course of business without a purpose of avoiding
or limiting such partys obligations under this sentence and (y) as necessary
to reasonably preserve attorney-client privilege or to comply with applicable
Law, _provided, however_ , that such materials shall be provided
in unredacted form to outside counsel to the receiving party in connection
with any such application or filing and the receiving party will cause its

respond as promptly as practicable and within any time limitations imposed by

__(g) Subject to applicable Law, each party hereto (or its counsel) shall, to
the extent practicable, permit the other party (or its counsel) to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party relating to the Transactions
to any Governmental Entity. To the extent practicable, none of the parties to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), Action or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party (or its counsel) the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties to this
Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early

however_ , that materials provided by the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the other party may be redacted (x)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements entered into in the
ordinary course of business without a purpose of avoiding or limiting such
partys obligations under this sentence and (y) as necessary to reasonably
preserve attorney-client privilege or to comply with applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that such materials shall be provided in unredacted form
to the receiving partys outside counsel representing such party before such
Governmental Entity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control, direct or interfere
with the operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. __

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Merger or the other Transactions, other than filing fees required to be paid
in connection with a filing under any applicable Antitrust Laws or Exon-
Florio, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose

 



\- 60 -  approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation due to such Person,
and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to

other consideration, make any commitment or incur any Liability or other
obligation.

waiting period under any Antitrust Law or enter into an agreement with any
Governmental Entity to delay or not consummate the Transactions without the
written consent of the other parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates to proffer to, agree to or actually (and none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent of
Parent, proffer to, agree to or actually) (i) divest, hold separate (including
by establishing a trust), or enter into any license (whether pursuant to an
exclusive or nonexclusive license) or similar agreement with respect to, or
agree to restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or
operate in a specified manner, any portion of the business or assets of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) pay any
amounts or make any commitments to obtain any consents, licenses, permits,
certificates, exemptions, waivers, approvals, authorizations, registrations,
clearances or Orders of a Governmental Entity or any other Person (other than
the payment of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel) in connection
with the Transactions, (iii) limit in any manner the ability of such entities
to conduct, own, operate or control their respective businesses, assets or
properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, or otherwise enter into any voting trust
arrangement, proxy arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement, or (iv)
agree to take mitigation measures, if any, to obtain the CFIUS Approval.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be obligated to litigate or
participate in the litigation of any Action brought by any Governmental Entity
or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay
materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions or seeking to

therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of

(whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or similar
agreement with respect to any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, Parent or any of its Affiliates
from developing, soliciting, considering, communicating, exchanging or
furnishing information, negotiating, disclosing, entering into or consummating
potential or definitive strategic transactions through both internally
generated and third party proposals.

 



\- 61 - (m) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or compromise of any Action or investigation against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions and will obtain the
prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such
Action or investigation. For purposes of this paragraph "participate" means
that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Action or investigation by the Company (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not breached), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to
the Action or investigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power
or other authority over the Action or investigation, except for the
settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

Section 5.05 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of Parent or the Company,
respectively, to effect the Merger not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall not cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Guarantor, Parent
and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions (including any communication required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be issued by
any party or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable national
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press
release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent or Guarantor, on the other hand.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.06, (i) Guarantor,
Parent, the Parent Representatives, the Company and the
Company Representatives and Guarantors and the Companys respective
Subsidiaries may make public releases or announcements concerning the
Transactions that are not inconsistent with previous press releases or
announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this
Section 5.06, (ii) Guarantor, Parent, the Parent Representatives, the Company
and the Company Representatives and Guarantors and the Companys respective
Subsidiaries may make public statements in response to specific questions by
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or

materially inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the Company and Parent or Guarantor and do
not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other parties, the
Merger or the other Transactions and (iii) the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.06 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed
to be made in connection with, or in response to, a Change of Board
Recommendation that is effected in compliance with Section 5.03.

 



\- 62 - Section 5.07 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees in the United
States with the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is reflected in the
books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility
and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for
vacation and severance, if applicable) in any New Plan in which such
Company Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in
each case except to the extent that recognizing such service would result in a
duplication of benefits. To the extent any Company Employee in the United
States participates in a New Plan that is a welfare plan or arrangement of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary following the Closing Date (a " _Parent
Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any Parent Subsidiary will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and any insurer or service provider under the
applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-existing condition
limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a
Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employees
commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan, (ii) participation
waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that would otherwise be
applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent
Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately
prior to such Company Employees commencement of participation in such Parent
Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by Company Employees
in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirement
under any such Parent Welfare Plan, but only to the extent that the Company
provides documentation of such co-payments and deductibles reasonably
requested by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary within 20 days of such request.
Until September 30, 2015, Parent shall provide (or cause a Parent Subsidiary
to provide) the Company Employees in the United States who continue to be
employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the "
_U.S. Continuing Employees_ ") with base salary and base wage rates, and
target annual cash performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or cash-
settled equity based incentive opportunities) that are not less favorable in
the aggregate than the U.S. Continuing Employees were eligible to earn from
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, but only to the extent
that such salaries, wage rates and target annual cash performance bonus
opportunities of the U.S. Continuing Employees are disclosed to Parent within
30 days after the Effective Time. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide U.S. Continuing Employees with the opportunity to participate in
those Company Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in which the U.S. Continuing Employees were participants
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earliest to occur of (1)
June 30, 2015, (2) the date the U.S. Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in a comparable New Plan and (3) the date the U.S. Continuing
Employee ceases to be eligible to participate under the Company Benefit Plan
terms.

 



\- 63 - (b) For a period of five Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries may disseminate any communications to
employees, the substance of which has been communicated to or coordinated with
Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Thereafter, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a copy of any other
written communication to be broadly disseminated to employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary relating to the Transactions or regarding
compensation, benefits or other treatment they will receive in connection
with or following the Merger at least three Business Days prior to such
dissemination, and will include any reasonable comments from Parent to such
communication that Parent makes in good faith within two Business Days after
Parents receipt of such communication (unless such communication is
substantively similar to such prior communications that have been initially
made after such announcement of the Merger or prior communications that have
been previously provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.07(b)).

(c) At least five Business Days prior to the date of the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall deliver or make available to Parent a report prepared by an
accounting firm, as of five Business Days prior to the date of the Proxy
Statement, detailing the possible tax consequences of Section 280G of the
Code.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect
such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_
"), including amending and/or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law
and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation
of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan.

(e) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07.
Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.07 or (iii) require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee.

 

Section 5.08 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and each Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the
corresponding organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries
and indemnification

 



\- 64 -  agreements, in each case as in existence on the date of this Agreement and
listed in Section 3.13(a)(xxii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnification Agreements_"), arising out of acts
or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the
Company and such Company Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements and the corresponding organizational documents of
the Company Subsidiaries, in each case in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the person to whom expenses are
advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the DGCL or by the applicable
indemnification agreement or organizational document, to repay such advanced
expenses to the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that
such director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification under
applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable indemnification agreement or
organizational document.

 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors, officers and employees of the Company for periods at or prior to
the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate
and the Company Bylaws. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the DandO
Indemnification Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase directors
and officers runoff insurance coverage (the " _D andO Runoff Insurance_"),
which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than six years for
the benefit of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Companys and any
Company Subsidiarys past and present directors and/or officers that are
insured under the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The DandO Runoff
Insurance shall provide coverage for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and such persons in their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time that is not
less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing directors and
officers policy (true and complete copies of which have been made available to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the DandO
Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder for a period of six years after the Effective Time or,
if such policies are terminated or cancelled during such six-year period,
obtain (subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence)
alternative DandO Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms as set forth
in this Section 5.08(c). Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Runoff Insurance in
excess of 300% (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that in
the event the cost of such DandO Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount,
in the aggregate, the Company shall remain obligated to provide, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest DandO

 



\- 65 -  Runoff Insurance coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The
Company and Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application
and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to
applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Runoff
Insurance. Parent shall upon written request furnish a copy of such insurance
policy to each beneficiary of such policy.

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and are not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
their properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall
be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.08, without relieving Parent of its obligations
under this Section 5.08.

 

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.08 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom

\- 95 -  all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and

extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of

defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. A partys pursuit of specific

be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this
Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

 

(d) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or
delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time,
place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of

substitution or release of any Person interested in the Transactions; (iv) any

of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the
Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other
right which Parent or Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company
(other than satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations or rights of Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of
the acceptance of the Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other
notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger
Sub or any other Person interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship
defenses generally (other than fraud by the Company), defenses to the payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement and defenses available to Guarantor under the Guarantee.
Guarantor acknowledges that it has received and will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions and that the waivers set
forth in this Section 8.15 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

(e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the
Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 preclude
any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this
Section 8.15. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.15 or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect
to this Section 8.15 shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and
may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company

covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its

subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered an Action in
equity or at law).

 

(f) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company and covenants
that: (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been
duly authorized by all necessary action, and no other proceedings on the part
of Guarantor or its stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement,
and do not contravene any provision of Guarantors organizational documents
or any Law or contractual restriction binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii)
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or
in equity), (iii) nothing in this Agreement will terminate its obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) Guarantor will not issue any
press release or other communication in contravention of Section 5.06.

(g) Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall waive any defenses, counterclaims or
rights of setoff that Parent or Merger Sub may have under this Agreement or
applicable Law.
