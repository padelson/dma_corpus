NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger_

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue,
New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
specified and agreed by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later
than the third Business Day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waiver by the party entitled thereto) of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver by the party entitled thereto) of such
conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance
with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL,
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to
effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects provided
in this Agreement and as set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect on Capital Stock; Payment for Shares_

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub._ Each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub (such shares, " _Excluded Shares_ "), in each case immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Appraisal Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
$24.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.02.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_")
(such shares, " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided
under Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to receive those rights under and to be paid such
consideration as is determined pursuant to Section 262, shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). If the Surviving Corporation
makes any payment after the Effective Time with respect to Appraisal Shares to
the holders thereof pursuant to such holdersÂ’ appraisal rights under Section
262, then any portion of the Merger Consideration relating to such Appraisal
Shares held in the Exchange Fund shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of any such demands or any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to the rights of appraisal of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demand that is not conditioned on consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Payment of Merger Consideration._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). Parent
shall take all steps necessary to enable and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent, on a timely basis, at or
immediately after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ Promptly (and in any event no later than five
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates, or a non-certificated share
or non-certificated shares, that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ " or " _Book-Entry Shares_ ", respectively)
which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the
Paying Agent, and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
any party may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) in the case of a Certificate,
surrender of such Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or (B) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, as applicable, so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock that such Certificate or Book-Entry Share represented immediately
prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II. No cash payment with respect to the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
in accordance with this Section 2.02.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
one

 



     

 

 



 

year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. No such investment or any loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable pursuant to this Article II. Parent shall take actions necessary to
ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash in an amount
sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Paying Agent, or, if the undistributed portion of the Exchange Fund has been
returned to Parent pursuant to Section 2.02(d), by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub,
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under any applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

been acted upon by staff of the SEC. None of the Company Subsidiaries has at
any time since January 1, 2016 been required to file any reports, schedules,
forms, statements or other documents with the SEC.

 



 

(b) As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC
Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements
of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the
case of all other Company SEC Documents), each Company SEC Document complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and, except to the extent amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, as of such respective
dates (and as of the date of such amended or superseded filing, as applicable)
none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a

 



     

 

 



 

material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No executive officer
of the Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications required
of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the
date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment
letters of the staff of the SEC received by the Company relating to the
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents is, to the
knowledge of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) The audited annual consolidated financial statements and the unaudited
quarterly consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, the
notes thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents when filed
(i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of such unaudited quarterly consolidated
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii)
fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and stockholdersÂ’ equity
for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
consolidated financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments).

 



 

(d) Except as reflected or reserved against in the condensed balance sheet of
the Company as of June 30, 2018 or specifically disclosed in the notes
thereto, included in the Company SEC Documents as of the date hereof (such
balance sheet and the notes thereto, the " _Company Balance Sheet_ "), the
Company does not have any liability or obligation of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be
recorded or reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP) other than
(i) liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, (ii) liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred since the date of the
Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

 



 

(e) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become
a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among the Company, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

 



 

(f) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in paragraph (e) of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange

 



     

 

 



 

Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The Company does not have any outstanding, and has not arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(g) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as such term is defined in paragraph (f) of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i)
regarding the reliability of the CompanyÂ’s financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the
Company and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the CompanyÂ’s assets that could have a
material effect on the CompanyÂ’s financial statements. The CompanyÂ’s
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2017,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Since January
1, 2016, none of the Company, the CompanyÂ’s outside auditors, the Company
Board or the audit committee of the Company Board has received any oral or
written notification of (i) any "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information or (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over
financial reporting, except for such information described in clauses (i) and
(ii) above as has been made available by the Company to Parent prior to the
date hereof. Each of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company and the CompanyÂ’s auditor has made all
applicable certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were true and accurate as of the time they were made, and as of
the date of this Agreement, none of them has informed the Company, the Company
Board or the audit committee of the Company Board that such Person will not be
able to give such certifications without qualification when next due. For
purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material
weakness" have the meanings assigned to them in Appendix A of Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP on

SECTION 3.11. _Employee Benefits._ (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list as of the date
of this Agreement of each Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent true, correct and complete copies of (i) such Company Benefit Plan,

Plan that the Company is prohibited from making available to Parent as the
result of applicable Law relating to the safeguarding of data privacy, (ii)
each trust, insurance, annuity or other funding Contract related thereto,
(iii) the most recent summary plan description and any summary of material

(c) The Company Benefit Plans are and have been administered in compliance
with their terms and with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ "), the Code and all other applicable Law,
except to the extent that noncompliance has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company is in
compliance with the requirements of

 



     

 

 



 

ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Law, except to the extent that
noncompliance has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) The Company by reason of its affiliation with any member of the CompanyÂ’s

any Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter or can rely on an opinion letter as to its qualification and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure
to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. No nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined
in Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility, that would reasonably be expected to result in material

ERISA or constitutes a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)

at any time in the past six years sponsored or contributed to, or has or has
had any liability or obligation in respect of, any such arrangement.

provide, post-retirement medical, life insurance or other welfare benefits for
any former or current employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
the spouses, dependents or beneficiaries of any individuals), whether under a
Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, except as required to comply with Section
4980B of the Code or any similar Law. The Company does not self-insure any
Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(g) There is no Company Benefit Plan or other agreement, plan, arrangement or
Contract covering any employee of the Company, individually or collectively,
that would reasonably be expected to give rise directly or indirectly to any
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code. No director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company
is entitled to any gross-up, make-whole or other additional payment from the
Company or any other Person in respect of any Tax (including Taxes imposed
under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code) or interest or penalty related
thereto.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of any of the Transactions (including as a result of any termination of

 



     

 

 



 

employment on or following the Effective Time) will, except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) entitle any former or current director,
officer, employee or independent contractor to retention, change in control,
severance, termination or similar compensation or benefits, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other obligation pursuant to any Company Benefit
Plan, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any
Company Benefit Plan or (iv) limit or restrict the right of the Company to
merge, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a "

compliance with Section 409A. No Company Stock Option constitutes a

otherwise have legal title to any real property.

 



 

(b) Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all real property leased by the Company as of the
date of this Agreement (the " _Leased Real Property_ "). The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the leases or
subleases, together with all assignments thereof and amendments, supplements
and modifications thereto, underlying the Leased Real Property (each, a "
_Lease_ "). With respect to each Leased Real Property and the accompanying
Lease, (i) the Company has good and valid leasehold interests in such Leased
Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, (ii)
the Lease is valid, binding and enforceable by the Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto (in each case subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and is in full force and effect, (iii)

Company, any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto, (iv) there are no disputes pending or, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge,
threatened with respect to the Lease, and the Company has not received any
notice of the intention of any other party to the Lease to amend, terminate,
not renew or reduce any commitment under the Lease, nor to the CompanyÂ’s
knowledge is any such party threatening to do so, (v) the Company has not
subleased, licensed or otherwise granted anyone the right to use or occupy the
Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or has collaterally assigned or
granted any other security interest in any such leasehold estate or any
interest therein and (vi) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no
condemnation or other proceeding in eminent domain, pending or threatened in
writing, affecting any portion of the Leased Real Property.

 



 

(c) The Company has good and valid title to all of its tangible assets
sufficient for the conduct of its business as presently conducted, except for
defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances
that, individually or in

 



     

 

 



 

the aggregate, have not materially interfered with, and would not reasonably
be expected to materially interfere with, its ability to conduct its business
as presently conducted. All such assets are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Permitted Liens.

CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) the Company
receives a Company Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did
not result from a breach of this Section 5.02 and for which the Company Board
or any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with the

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with the
CompanyÂ’s outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (ii) solely in the case of clause (i)(B), enter into a definitive
written agreement providing for the consummation of a Superior Proposal and
concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); _provided_

proposal, the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined in good
faith (1) after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside counsel, with respect

under applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change and (2)
after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside counsel and financial advisor,
with respect to the actions described in clause (i)(B) and clause (ii) of this
Section 5.02(f), that the Company Takeover Proposal received by the Company
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes
offered by Parent in such binding proposal were given effect; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.02(f) shall be void and of no force and effect unless such
termination is in accordance with Section 8.01(f) and the Company pays to
Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.08 prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position required by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case

promulgated under the Exchange Act) and (ii) no disclosure that the Company
Board or any committee thereof may determine (after consultation with the
CompanyÂ’s outside counsel) that the Company is required to make under
applicable Law will constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ that
in no event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof make an Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section 5.02(f).

the Company Bylaws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any

Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval as
soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it will not review

5.02, the Company shall take all lawful action necessary to solicit and obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, including engaging a proxy solicitation firm
for the

 



     

 

 



 

purpose of assisting in the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company may, after consultation with Parent,
adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting only (i) to the
extent required by applicable Law to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) to the extent required by a court of competent
jurisdiction in connection with any Proceedings in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions or (iii) if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, in each case for the
minimum duration necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise to such
adjournment, recess or postponement (and in any event, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law or a court of competent jurisdiction, not beyond
the earlier of (x) the date that is 30 days after the date that the Company
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (or, if applicable, 30 days
after the newly scheduled date for any such originally scheduled Company
Stockholders Meeting that is adjourned, recessed or postponed in accordance

Date). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including any Adverse
Recommendation Change), unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligations.

Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by
the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information with
respect to it or provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent, in the absence of such a correction, the Proxy Statement would contain
a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and the Company shall disseminate such correction
to the stockholders of the Company in an amendment or supplement mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly
upon the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC and of
any request (whether written or oral) by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all
such comments, requests and any other written correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the

 



     

 

 



 

other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section

of their

 



     

 

 



 

respective subsidiaries to, and the Company shall not, without the prior

Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) terminate any existing
relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent, any of its

termination or creation of any relationship, contractual right or obligation,
that is exclusively related to any radioligand therapy product under
development by Parent solely for the treatment of prostate cancer as of the
date of this Agreement (any such product, a " _Permitted Product_ ");
_provided_ that the terms and conditions of such sale, divestiture, license,
conveyance or hold separate, or termination or creation of any relationship,
contractual right or obligation, that is exclusively related to a Permitted
Product would not (A) materially impair the anticipated benefits of the
Transactions to Parent and its subsidiaries (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, any such benefit related to such Permitted Product), (B) have a
material adverse effect on any product currently marketed or under development
by Parent (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, such Permitted Product) and
(C) be on terms and conditions that are unreasonably burdensome to Parent (a "
_Permitted Antitrust Action_ ") (each action or condition described in clauses

").

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) furnish to the other party such

or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the other party
with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its

other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or

Approvals, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all
communications and strategy for dealing with the FTC, the DOJ and any other
Governmental Entity with respect to the HSR Act, Section 721 and any other
Required Regulatory Approval, and Parent shall, on behalf of the parties,
control and lead the defense strategy for dealing with any Proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions that are
brought by or relate to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to the HSR Act, Section 721 or any other Required Regulatory Approval.

 



 

(e) In addition to and without limiting any of the partiesÂ’ respective
obligations in this Section 6.03, each of the Company, the Company Board, the
Special Committee, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action necessary
to ensure that no state takeover statute, "business combination", "control

Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Transactions and this Agreement.

6.04 is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
Effective Time in violation of applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that nothing contained in this Section 6.04 is intended to give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time in violation of applicable
Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Equity Awards._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions (including
obtaining any required Consents) as may be required to effect the following:

 



 

(i) at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, and that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
underlying

 



     

 

 



 

such Company Stock Option (the " _Exercise Price_ ") that is less than the
Merger Consideration shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Stock
Option becoming entitled to receive with respect thereto solely an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (A) the excess of (1) the Merger
Consideration over (2) the Exercise Price with respect to such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(ii) at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, and that has an Exercise Price that is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, shall be canceled, and the holder of such Company Stock
Option will not be entitled to receive any payment in respect of such Company
Stock Option; and

 



 

(iii) at the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding and not settled
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 6.05 as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event no later than
10 Business Days) after the Effective Time. All amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 6.05 shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and

SECTION 6.06. _Continuing Employee Matters._ (a) For a period from the
Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the
employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall
receive (i) base salaries or wage rates no less than each such employeeÂ’s base
salary or wage rate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance pay and benefits no less favorable than severance pay and benefits
as set forth in Section 6.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii)
other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such employees of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
nor any of ParentÂ’s subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt
any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, Equity Interests
pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; _provided_ , _further_ , that no
plans or arrangements of the Company providing for such issuance shall be
taken into account in determining whether employee benefits are substantially
comparable in the aggregate. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly

 



     

 

 



 

reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i)
for purposes of benefits under ParentÂ’s vacation program, (ii) for purposes of
eligibility to participate in any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent
(other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan) and
ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan and (iii) unless covered under another arrangement with
or of the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under ParentÂ’s severance plan
(in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), solely to the extent that
Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the Surviving
Corporation and not in any case where credit would result in duplication of
benefits), but not for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of Parent.

 



 

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare plans of the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any
such plan.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the scope of this Section 6.06, this Section 6.06 shall
be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.06, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.06. Nothing contained herein
shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that
would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any specific plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or
understandings or to continue the employment of any specific person.
Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting
or limiting the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend,
modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or
understandings of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing
therein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy,
arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose.

 



 

SECTION 6.07. _Indemnification._ (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities, for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Person and the Company or any Company Subsidiary (in each case, as in effect
on the

 



     

 

 



 

date hereof and, in the case of any indemnification agreement, as set forth in
Section 6.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and of which the Company has
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies), without further
action, as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable rights of indemnification
and exculpation contemplated by this Section 6.07 and pursuant to the terms of
the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect at or immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall not be impaired by any modification of such terms in
any amendment or restatement of such Company Charter or Company Bylaws
following the Effective Time (including in connection with the filing of the
Certificate of Merger).

 



 

(b) Parent shall obtain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain,
at or prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail") directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by
the CompanyÂ’s or any Company SubsidiaryÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policies, with coverage for six years following the Effective Time
on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to the
insureds than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.07(b) an amount in excess of
300% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for such insurance for its current fiscal year; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if the amount necessary to procure such prepaid (or "tail")
insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be obligated to provide as much
coverage as may be obtained for such maximum amount.

 



 

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall make proper provision so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at
ParentÂ’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.07.

 



 

SECTION 6.08. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.07,
this Section 6.08 and Section 6.10, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
and the other Transactions are consummated.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f);

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)
prior to or at the time the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iii); or

 



 

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
made, proposed or communicated to the Company Board, any committee of the
Company Board or management of the Company, or is publicly made, proposed or
communicated or otherwise becomes publicly known, or any Person or group
publicly proposes or announces an intention to make a Company Takeover
Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iii), or by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.01(c) and (C) within 12 months of such termination (1) any
transaction included within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal is
consummated or (2) the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing
for the consummation of any transaction within the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal, in each case whether or not involving the same Company
Takeover Proposal or the Person or group making the Company Takeover Proposal
referred to in clause (A); _provided_ that for purposes of clause (C), the
term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 9.03, except that all references to "20%" in such definition shall
be deemed references to "50%",

 



 

then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee of $73,500,000
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), less the amount of Parent Expenses
previously and actually paid by the Company to Parent (or its designee)
pursuant to Section 6.08(c). Any fee due under this Section 6.08(b) shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (1)
in the case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such
termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within
three Business Days after the date of such termination of this Agreement and
(3) in the case of clause (iii) above, within three Business Days after the
earlier of (x) the date of the consummation of the transaction referred to in
clause (C)(1) thereof and (y) the date of entry into the definitive agreement
referred to in clause (C)(2) thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may
be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(c) In the event that either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) promptly upon delivery of written demand by Parent to the Company
(which Parent may deliver at any time after this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii)), but in no event later than three Business
Days after the date such demand is delivered, by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an account designated by Parent, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including all due diligence fees, all filing and printing fees
and all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts
and consultants) (" _Parent Expenses_ ") incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or
their

 



     

 

 



 

respective affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to pay for Parent Expenses
in excess of $5,000,000. Payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to
this Section 6.08(c) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay any applicable Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
6.08(b); _provided_ that in the event any Company Termination Fee is payable
after the time the Company pays any Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
6.08(c), the amount of the Company Termination Fee payable by the Company
shall be reduced by the amount of such Parent Expenses actually paid to
Parent.

 



 

(d) In the event that:

 



 

(i) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i), and at the time of such termination the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01(a) (if the Legal Restraint relates to matters referenced in
Section 7.01(b)) or 7.01(b) shall not have been satisfied, but all other
conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied (or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled thereto) (or in the
case of conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
are capable of being satisfied on such date); or

 



 

(ii) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(ii) solely as a result of a Legal Restraint referred to in
Section 8.01(b)(ii) arising under the HSR Act or any competition, merger
control, antitrust or similar Law of any jurisdiction, which Legal Restraint
did not result from the CompanyÂ’s failure to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), which
Legal Restraint referred to in Section 8.01(g) did not result from the
CompanyÂ’s failure to perform any of its covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement,

 



 

then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $150,000,000 (the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ "), which shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an account designated by the Company within three Business Days after
the date of such termination of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent
Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.
ParentÂ’s obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee shall not in any way
effect the CompanyÂ’s obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 6.08(b)(iii).

that if the Effective Time has not occurred by the end of the

 



     

 

 



 

offering period in effect as of the date hereof (the " _Current Offering
Period_ "), then the Company will suspend the Company ESPP until the Effective
Time. If the Effective Time occurs on or before the end of the Current
Offering Period, reasonably promptly following the Effective Time (but in any
event not later than three Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay, through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s payroll, to each
participant in the Current Offering Period an amount (not less than zero) in

make a new request)) or (iv) the Company shall have committed a willful and
material breach of its obligations under Section 5.02, which breach, if

8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination), without
any liability or obligation on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, except that no such termination shall
relieve any party from liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or the
willful and material breach by such party of any provision set forth in this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" means
a deliberate act or failure to act, which act or failure to act constitutes in
and of itself a material breach of this Agreement that the breaching party is
aware would, or would reasonably be expected to, breach its obligations under
this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 8.03. _Amendment; Extension; Waiver._ This Agreement may be amended,
modified and supplemented in any and all respects only by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. Any agreement on the part of
a party to any extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties (treating Parent
and Merger Sub as one party for this purpose) may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other

 



       
 

 



 

party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, there shall be made no amendment, modification or supplement to
this Agreement (x) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval which
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the
further approval of such stockholders or (y) after the Effective Time. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.10(b),

damages as a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific

parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of

the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such

the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable,

hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. The foregoing shall not restrict any
partyÂ’s right to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from,
such final trial court judgment, or to bring suit for the recognition or
enforcement of any judgment obtained in any court sitting in the State of
Delaware or in any other court of competent jurisdiction following final
determination of the applicable matter.
