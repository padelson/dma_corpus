Vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid (" _JAB_ "), and Panther Merger
Co., a Washington corporation and an Affiliate of JAB (" _Merger Sub_ ", the

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of JAB, Merger Sub and the

WBCA (the date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington, or such later time as is

AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION _

2.1 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in
their entirety to read the same as the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "Peets Coffee and Tea, Inc." and as so amended

_Charter_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or in accordance
with applicable Law.

2.2 _The Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company shall be amended in their entirety to read the same as

until thereafter amended as provided therein or in accordance with applicable
Law.

 

2.3 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of

2.4 _Officers_. The officers of the Company (other than such officers
who JAB and the Company mutually determine shall not remain officers of the

the Bylaws.

ARTICLE III

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, no par value,
of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding

 



6  immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by JAB,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of JAB that is directly or indirectly wholly
owned by the ultimate parent of JAB, (ii) Shares owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (including Shares
held in the Companys treasury) and (iii) any Shares the holder of which (A)
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (B) has
demanded its rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance
with Section 23B.13 of the WBCA and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost
its rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
(each of such Shares described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), an " _Excluded
Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive $73.50 in cash per Share, without interest
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and thereafter any Shares
represented by a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in each case, other than
Excluded Shares) shall represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding and automatically
be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have under Section 3.2.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.2 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration. By virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to
receive only those rights provided under Section 23B.13 of the WBCA. From and
after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled
to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a shareholder, member
or equity owner of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.2, if any holder
of Shares for which such holder has demanded dissenters rights shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the
right to dissent or its dissenters rights, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders Shares shall
no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes
specified in Section 3.3(f).

 

(c) The Company shall give JAB (i) prompt written notice of any notice
received by the Company of any shareholders intent to demand the fair value
of any

 



7  Shares, any demand received by the Company for payment of the fair value of
any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 23B.13 of the WBCA and received by the Company which
relate to any such demand for dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to
reasonably participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for dissenters rights under Section 23B.13 of the WBCA. Unless required by
applicable Law or Order, the Company will not, except with the prior written
consent of JAB, make any payment with respect to demands for dissenters
rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, JAB shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent (which shall be a reputable bank
or trust company) selected by JAB (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 3.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by JAB; _provided_ , that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.1(a) shall be promptly returned
to JAB.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within five (5) business days thereafter) the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (or,
in the case of "street-holders," deliver to the Depository Trust Company)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably acceptable
to the parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall solely
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 3.3(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of

 



8  the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check or wire (pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of
transmittal) for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, JAB or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange
Fund) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation.
Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.3(e) below) or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, JAB, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to any
Governmental Entity pursuant to and in compliance with applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by JAB, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be
required by JAB as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue a check or wire (pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter
of transmittal) in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

(f) _FIRPTA; Withholding Rights_. Not more than thirty (30)
days prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to JAB a certificate,
substantially in the form provided for in Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and
1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations, establishing that the Company is not a
"United States real property holding corporation"

 



9  within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and has not been such a United States real
property holding corporation within the five (5) year period ending on the
Closing Date, and a copy of notice provided to the Internal Revenue Service ("
_IRS_ ") in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.897-2(h)(2) of
the Treasury regulations. Each of JAB, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it reasonably determines in good faith it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by JAB, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by JAB, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by JAB, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or to such Book-Entry Shares.

3.4 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to, and effective as of, the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to accelerate the
vesting of each outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans
(each, a " _Company Option_ "), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 3.3(f). In the
event that the exercise price per Share under any Company Option, as adjusted,
is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefore
and shall have no further force or effect.

(b) _Treatment of Other Awards Under Stock Plans_. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding award of a right (other than awards of Company
Options) entitling the holder thereof to Shares or cash equal to or based on
the value of Shares (a " _Share Unit_ ") issued under the Stock Plans that is
outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Share Unit and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment as
provided in Section 3.3(f). At the Effective Time, each holder of a Share Unit
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
3.4(b).

 



10 (c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee
of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of Sections 3.4(a) and 3.4(b). The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither JAB
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other
capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Options or otherwise.

 

(d) _Termination of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall
terminate the Amended and Restated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan prior to
the Effective Time and shall not permit any new offering period to begin after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

3.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
provide to JAB and the holders of Shares the same economic effect
as contemplated by Article III of this Agreement prior to such change;
provided that nothing in this Section 3.5 shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited

29  practice). The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have direct or indirect
material liability as a result of any misclassification of any Person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2010, none of

Company or its Subsidiaries is in violation of any term of any third party
employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure
obligation or non-competition agreement.

 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all Registered Intellectual Property and material
unregistered Trademarks owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company
and its Subsidiaries own free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) all the Intellectual Property that is owned or purported to be
owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Owned Company IP_ ") or have
sufficient rights to use all Intellectual Property that is used in their
respective businesses as currently conducted (the " _Company IP_ "). All of
the Owned Company IP is valid and enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction.

(b) The conduct of the businesses of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries does not infringe, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate
any material Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, no third party is infringing,
diluting, misappropriating or otherwise violating any material Owned Company
IP.

 

(c) There are no material Actions or Judgments pending that have been
served, or, to the knowledge of the Company, filed but not served or
threatened, that seek to cancel, limit or challenge the ownership, validity,
registerability, enforceability, or use of or right to use any Owned Company
IP.

 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries take reasonable measures to
maintain, preserve, police and protect the Owned Company IP, including the
confidentiality of all owned Trade Secrets, and to the Companys knowledge, no
material owned Trade Secrets have been used, disclosed or discovered by any
Person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure and/or license
agreements.

 



30 (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring
employees who develop Intellectual Property on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to assign such Intellectual Property to the Company or its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have obtained assignments of all Intellectual Property on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries by employees who develop
Intellectual Property on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

For purposes of this Agreement: " _Intellectual Property_ " means all foreign,
multinational and domestic (i) trademarks, service marks, brand names,

_Insurance Policies_ ") is in full force and effect and all premiums due with
respect to all Insurance Policies have been paid, with such exceptions that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no claim in excess of
$1,000,000 pending under any Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been
denied or disputed by the underwriters of such Insurance Policy (provided,
that a reservation right by the underwriters of such Insurance Policy shall
not constitute a denial or dispute for purposes of this representation)
and there has been no threatened termination of any such Insurance Policy
during the two (2) years preceding the date of this Agreement, which Insurance
Policies cannot be replaced in the ordinary course of business. Since January
1, 2012, no notice of cancellation of any Insurance Policy has been received,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation (and, solely with
respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.3(b)) only if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside

such action may be made pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) or Section 8.3(b)

cause its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with JAB

Section 8.3(b), including in the case of a Superior Proposal, by such Superior
Proposal no longer constituting a Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end
of the Notice Period, the board of directors of the Company shall have
considered in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by JAB and any other information provided by JAB and shall have determined
(after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that if such changes were to be given effect that failure to make a
Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in the case of clause (y) above,
any such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
and (iv) in the event of each and every change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material terms of any Superior Proposal, the Company

disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and JAB shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4 (it being understood
that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only the
information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed to have the
substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Recommendation or otherwise deemed to violate the Companys obligations under
this Section 6.2(d)).

will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their respective
Representatives on the Company or its Subsidiaries behalf to, immediately
cease and terminate any activities, discussions or negotiations with any

Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required under a Material Contract or otherwise
(unless alleged under a Contract that is not material) in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Actions commenced or,
to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or (c) any fact,
event or circumstance that (i) in the case of the Company, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) has
materially impaired, or would reasonably be expected to materially impair the
ability of such party (or, in the case of JAB, Merger Sub) to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) would cause,

 



49  or would reasonably be expected to cause, the failure of any condition
precedent to the Companys or JAB and Merger Subs obligations to consummate
the Merger under this Agreement, in each case within three (3) business days
of an executive officer of such party becoming aware of occurrence of such
fact, event or circumstance. Each such notification shall include a
certification of an officer of the Company that such notification is being
delivered in accordance with this Section 6.14. No such notification shall be
deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purpose
of (i) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties
made by the parties in this Agreement, or (ii) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied. Delivery of
notification pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party receiving such
notice.

 

6.15 _ Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities
of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

 

6.16 _ Employee Benefits_.

(a) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, JAB
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide each
employee of the Company and any Subsidiary who continues to be employed by
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") with compensation (including, as applicable, base salary, bonus
plans (based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus payments), other
employee benefits (except for retention benefits), health and welfare benefits
and benefits under any plan intended to be qualified within the meaning of
section 401(a) of the Code (" _401(k) Plan_ ")) that is at least
substantially comparable in the aggregate to that provided to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.16 shall (i) create any right in any Continuing Employee to
continued employment by JAB, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary
thereof or (ii) require JAB, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary
thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan after the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Section 6.16 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with JAB, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and
the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment,
subject to the terms and conditions of employment agreements, severance
plans and change of control plans.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(i) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or
vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the
personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, JAB shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable,
assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and
allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

 



50 (ii) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, benefit
accrual, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health or
welfare benefit plan or 401(k) Plan of JAB and/or the Surviving Corporation,
then JAB shall ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan and 401(k)
plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, benefit accrual, vesting and
allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service
with the Company prior to the Effective Time to the same extent that
such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan or 401(k) Plan of the Company.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan of JAB and/or the
Surviving Corporation made available to Continuing Employees in the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and
give effect, in determining any deductibles and maximum out of pocket
limitations, to claims incurred, amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to,
Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party

and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to
the other party hereto resulting from any willful and material breach of this
Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 6.10 (Expenses), this
Section 8.5, Article IX and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 



54 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by (x) JAB or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (in the case
of Section 8.2(a), if at such time the Shareholders Meeting has not been held
and JAB is not in breach of its obligations under Section 6.5 and Section 6.9)
or Section 8.2(b), or (y) JAB pursuant to Section 8.4(d) and in connection
with either (x) or (y) therewith:

 

(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed after
the date hereof and not clearly withdrawn in good faith prior to the
Termination Date (in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or
Section 8.4(d)) or the Shareholders Meeting (in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.2(b)); and

(B) within twelve (12) months after termination of this Agreement, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated
by any Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this clause (C),
the references to "10%" and "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%") (any such agreement or
consummation, an " _Acquisition Event_ "), then the Company shall pay to JAB
the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of consummation of such
Acquisition Event;

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Company shall
pay to JAB the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such
termination; and

(iii) by JAB pursuant to Section 8.4 (other than Section 8.4(d)), then
the Company shall pay to JAB the Termination Fee within two (2) business days
of such termination.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean $30,000,000.
No Acquisition Proposal made by a Person shall be deemed to have been "clearly
withdrawn," in the event that the Company later agrees within the 12-month
period specified in Section 8.5(b)(i)(B) to or consummates an Acquisition
Event with such Person or an Affiliate thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the fee referred to in this Section 8.5(b) on more than one occasion
and (y) the parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to JAB and Merger Sub with respect to
this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is
paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company (and the Companys
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
shareholders and Representatives) shall have no further liability to JAB and
Merger Sub under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out
of its willful and material breach of Section 6.2, Section 6.3 or Section
6.4; _provided_ , further, that the aggregate amount of any damages determined
by a court to be payable by the Company pursuant to the foregoing proviso
shall be reduced by the amount of any Termination Fee previously paid to JAB
pursuant this Section 8.5(b).

 



55 (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the
Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such payment, JAB or Merger Sub
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee (or a portion thereof), the Company shall pay JAB its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate published in
the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. All payments under Sections 8.5(b) shall be
made promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the party receiving such payment.

(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

to the other parties.

9.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific

RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE

56  MERGER AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF SHARES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE WBCA, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE. The parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of

documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY

THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER

in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such
party. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the non-breaching parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other party and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement against the other party, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection therewith. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, each party hereby agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other

HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER JAB AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER

Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other

hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The

parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3

Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

9.9 _Obligations of JAB and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub or another Affiliate of JAB to take any action, JAB shall
be liable for any failure of such Person to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

 

9.10 _ Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in

9.11 _ Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity declares that any 

 



59  term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
