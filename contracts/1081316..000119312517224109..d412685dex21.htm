_Merger Subs_ ").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, on April 29, 2014, the Company and certain entities in which it,
directly or indirectly, holds an equity interest, including TCEH and EFCH
(each as defined below) and their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)
(collectively, the " _Debtors_ ") commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11
of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. (as amended,
the " _Bankruptcy Code_ ") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware (the " _Bankruptcy Court_ "), which cases are
currently pending before the Honorable Christopher S. Sontchi and jointly
administered for procedural purposes only under Case No. 14-10979, and any
proceedings relating thereto (collectively, the " _Chapter 11 Cases_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the EFH Debtors and EFIH Debtors (as such terms are defined in the
Plan of Reorganization) (collectively, the " _E-Side Debtors_") continue to
operate their respective businesses as debtors-in-possession under Sections
1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code;

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, the E-Side Debtors, on the one hand, and
the TCEH Debtors (as such term is defined in the Plan of Reorganization) and
certain other Debtors, on the other, separated from common ownership under the
Company;

 

WHEREAS, subject to approval of this Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court, the
Company, EFIH, Parent and the Merger Subs have determined to engage in a
strategic business combination as more fully set forth below;

WHEREAS, the E-Side Debtors will file a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, as
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (as such plan may be further amended, modified
or changed from time to time in accordance with the terms and conditions
thereof and this Agreement, the " _Plan of Reorganization_ ");

WHEREAS, under the plan of reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court on
August 29, 2016 [D.I. 9421] (the " _TCEH Plan_ "), on October 3, 2016, Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and then a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company (" _TCEH_
"), and the other TCEH Debtors, together with certain other direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of the Company identified in the TCEH Plan, were

 



1  restructured in a transaction intended to qualify as a reorganization under
Sections 368(a)(1)(G) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") through a taxable transfer of certain assets to a separate
subsidiary of Reorganized TCEH (the " _TCEH Preferred Stock Entity_ ") in the
TCEH Preferred Stock Sale (as defined below) (the steps in this clause,
collectively, the " _Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off_");

WHEREAS, in connection with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, TCEH formed a new
wholly-owned subsidiary, then-named TEX Energy LLC (n/k/a Vistra Energy Corp.)
(" _Reorganized TCEH_ " or " _Vistra Energy_ "), that (a) was treated as
disregarded from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the
date on which the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off was consummated (the " _TCEH
Effective Date_ ") and (b) was the "controlled corporation" in connection
with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. New Holdco (as defined below) was treated
as disregarded from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes until
the TCEH Effective Date, on which date certain assets of TCEH and the Company
were transferred to New Holdco in connection with the TCEH Preferred Stock
Sale;

 

WHEREAS, on the TCEH Effective Date, all claims against the TCEH Debtors,
except for liabilities assumed by Reorganized TCEH or a subsidiary thereof
pursuant to the TCEH Plan, were cancelled in connection with the Reorganized
TCEH Spin-Off;

 

WHEREAS, (a) TCEH transferred all of TCEHs interests in its Subsidiaries
(excluding the stock of TCEH Finance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _TCEH
Finance_ ")) to Reorganized TCEH (the " _TCEH Contribution_ "); and (b) the
EFH Debtors transferred to Reorganized TCEH the equity interests in then-named
EFH Corporate Services Company (" _EFH Corporate Services_ "), then-named EFH
Properties Company and the other Subsidiaries of EFH specified in the TCEH
Plan and the Separation Agreement, and also contributed certain other assets
and liabilities related to the TCEH Debtors operations, all as provided in
the TCEH Plan and the Separation Agreement (such entities, together with TCEH
and Reorganized TCEH and their respective Subsidiaries, the " _Spin-Off
 Entities_", and such contributions by the EFH Debtors, collectively, the "
_EFH Contribution_ ", and the EFH Contribution, together with the TCEH
Contribution, the " _Reorganized TCEH Contributions_ "). In exchange for the
Reorganized TCEH Contributions, TCEH received (a) all of the equity interests
of Reorganized TCEH, (b) the net cash proceeds of the new Reorganized TCEH
debt issued for cash, (c) the right to receive payments under a

(such deposits in clause (a), clause (b) and clause (c) herein, the "
_Accessible Account Deposit_ "). The EFH Plan Administrator Board shall
distribute the amounts from the Accessible Account Deposit in accordance with
the Plan of Reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the EFH Plan
Administrator Board shall be entitled to create such sub-accounts in the
EFH/EFIH Cash Distribution Account as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization " _Cash Deposit
Amount_ " shall mean $9,000,000,000 _less_ the DIP Repayment; provided, that
the Cash Deposit Amount shall be less any reductions in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_. In no event shall the amount deposited by EFH Merger Sub
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_, _plus_ _¸_ __ the DIP Repayment, _plu_ s
the agreed value of the Parent stock issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8_
exceed $9,000,000,000.

Section 1.8  _Tax-Related Adjustments_. In the event the Internal Revenue
Service (the " _IRS_ ") indicates that it will not provide one or more of the
required Supplemental Rulings unless the consideration payable to the EFH
Stakeholders (the " _EFH Consideration_ ") in accordance with the Plan of
Reorganization and/or the consideration payable to the EFIH Stakeholders in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization (the " _EFIH Consideration_ ")
includes some amount of Parent stock (in lieu of an equal amount of cash that
otherwise would be part of the EFH

 



7  Consideration and/or the EFIH Consideration), then Parent shall issue an
amount of Parent Preferred Stock (as defined below) sufficient to obtain the
Supplemental Rulings; provided, however, that in the event the IRS indicates
that (a) the amount of Parent Preferred Stock necessary to obtain the
Supplemental Rulings is in an amount greater than (x) the amount of cash on
hand at the Company at the Effective Time, minus (y) the amount payable to
the holders of EFH Non-Qualified Benefit Claims (as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization), minus (z) an amount equal to the cash that is necessary to
satisfy actual and estimated administrative and priority claims of the
Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all relevant professional
fees) or (b) Parent stock, other than Parent Preferred Stock, with terms
substantially consistent with those set forth on  _Exhibit D_ , or otherwise
on terms with respect to interest and maturity that would be customary for an
issuer such as Parent in light of market conditions at the time of issuance
upon advice of Parents financial advisor, is necessary to obtain one or more
Supplemental Rulings, then the Company, EFIH (to the extent any such stock is
anticipated to be issued to EFIH Stakeholders), Merger Subs and Parent shall
cooperate, work and negotiate in good faith to identify an
alternative structure or issue such other amount and/or form of stock
consideration necessary to obtain the Supplemental Rulings; _provided,
however_ , the terms and conditions of such alternative structure, the amount
of stock consideration, and/or the terms or conditions of such stock other
than Parent Preferred Stock shall be subject to the consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the final proviso to the
preceding sentence, for the avoidance of doubt it shall not be unreasonable
for Parent to withhold its consent to a proposal or structure that would
require it to issue (a) any common stock, (b) Parent Preferred Stock in an
amount that exceeds $225 million or (c) preferred stock with greater voting
or veto rights than the rights provided with respect to the Parent Preferred
Stock terms that are set forth on _Exhibit D_. In all cases, the Company,
EFIH, and Parent each understand that the issuance of Parent stock (including
Parent Preferred Stock) is not intended to increase or decrease the overall
amount of consideration received by EFH Stakeholders or EFIH Stakeholders or
the total amount of merger consideration payable by Parent (the " _Value
Condition_ "). To the extent Parent stock must be issued pursuant to this
paragraph, the mechanics implementing this paragraph shall be included in a
Plan Supplement document that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, EFIH,
Merger Subs and Parent and the parties hereto shall take all steps necessary
to effectuate the other transactions contemplated hereby. If Parent is
required to issue Parent stock as part of the EFH Consideration and/or EFIH
Consideration as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_, then prior to Closing,
Parent and the Company shall enter into a customary exchange agent agreement
with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), who
shall act as exchange agent, registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of
exchanging shares in the Company or EFIH, as applicable, for the Parent stock
to be issued hereunder. Parent shall establish customary procedures for the
exchange of such shares with the Companys prior approval (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). " _Parent Preferred
Stock_ " means preferred stock issued by Parent that is on substantially the
same terms as is set forth on _Exhibit D_ , or otherwise on terms with respect
to interest and maturity that would be customary for an issuer such as Parent
in light of market conditions at the time of issuance upon advice of Parents
financial advisor (as may further be modified as necessary or helpful to
obtain the Supplemental Rulings by mutual agreement between the Company and
EFIH on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand). In the event that (a)
Parent agrees to modifications to the terms of the Parent Preferred

 



8  Stock as set forth on _Exhibit D_ (including, without limitation, the voting
or veto rights thereof) or (b) Parent agrees to issue common stock or Parent
Preferred Stock in an amount that exceeds $225 million, in each case in order
to obtain the Supplemental Rulings, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated elsewhere in this Agreement (including in _this Section_ __ _
1.8_), the Company and EFIH shall be deemed to have agreed to such changes to
the consideration payable hereunder as long as the Value Condition is
satisfied.

 

Section 1.9 _Oncor Holdings Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Oncor Letter Agreement or any other
agreement entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated herein
and therein, but without limiting the Companys and EFIHs obligations
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.20_, Parent and each Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the consummation of the Oncor Holdings Merger is not a condition to
the Closing and, to the extent the Oncor Holdings Merger is not able to be
consummated at the Closing, the conditions, covenants, agreements,
representations, warranties and other provisions of this Agreement relating to
the execution, consummation and effectiveness of the Oncor Holdings Merger
shall be disregarded for all purposes hereunder.

benefits, that would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to Parent. There are no pending or,

Governmental Entity involving any Assumed Plan that would reasonably be
expected to result in material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to Parent.

(vi) Except for any payments made at or prior to the Effective Time, none of
the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions

correct copy of the certificate of formation and operating agreement or

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
the Merger Subs does not, and the consummation by Parent and the Merger Subs
of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will

(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(i) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto, and other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any Contract
governing any indebtedness of Parent requiring such filings to be made since
the Applicable Date (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and
documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each of the Parent Reports, including any financial
statements or schedules included therein, at the time of its filing or being
furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to, or after, the date hereof, as of
the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports filed with or furnished to the
SEC prior to the date hereof did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the
SEC staff with respect to the Parent Reports. None of the Parent Reports is,
to the knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 

(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports as amended prior to the date hereof
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date hereof, will
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date (and if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment prior to the date hereof) and each of the
statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and
shareholders equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
Reports (including any related notes and schedules), as finally amended prior
to the date hereof, fairly presents in all

 



40  material respects, or in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date
hereof, will fairly present in all material respects the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows, as the case may be, of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end adjustments), in
each case in accordance with GAAP, except as may be noted therein.

(iii) Parent maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, in each case, in all material respects. Except as has not had, or would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material effect on the nature or reliability of the information disclosed in
Parents periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act, (A) Parent maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Parent is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC
and other public disclosure documents (including Parents chief executive
officer and chief financial officer) and (B) Parent has not disclosed, and is
not required to disclose, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date of this Agreement, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee
of Parents board of directors, and has not had, (1) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (2) any fraud, known to Parent, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

(iv) Except as has not had and would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has a commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Parent Reports or the financial statements included
therein.

 



41 (f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2016, there has not
occurred a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities and
obligations (A) set forth in Parents consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2016, including the notes thereto, included in the Company
Reports, (B) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2016, (C) incurred in connection with the Closing
Date Transactions or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this
Agreement, (D) pursuant to any Contract that would be required to be filed by
Parent as a "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10)
of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, except for any such Contract that is
a Benefit Plan) or that was or is material to the business, operations or
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but not
including any liability for breach thereunder), or (E) that has not had and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Agreement " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means (i)
any fact, event, change, effect, development, circumstance or occurrence
that, individually or together with all other facts, events, changes, effects,
developments, circumstances or occurrences, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on, or change in, the
financial condition, business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the avoidance of doubt any
reference in any provision hereof to any item that "would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect", or any similar phrase, shall be interpreted as
"individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably expected to
have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect" (and such interpretation shall extend
to the negative expression of such phrase, or any similar phrase, _mutatis
mutandis_ ), or (ii) anything that prevents, materially restricts, or
materially impairs Parent or the Merger Subs from consummating the Closing

(i) (x) changes or developments in general economic or political conditions or
the securities, credit or financial markets, in general, globally or outside
of or in the U.S. or in the State of Texas or (y) changes that are the result
of acts of war or terrorism or any hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood,
earthquake or other natural disaster or other weather-related event,
circumstance or development (other than such acts of war or terrorism or any
hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster or
other weather-related event, circumstance or development that cause any
physical damage or destruction to or render physically or operationally
unusable any facility or property of Parent, the Merger Subs or any of their
respective Subsidiaries);

 

(ii) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification,
reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation, ordinance, order,
protocol or any other Law of or by any national, regional, state or local

or distribution systems (other than changes or developments that render
operationally unusable any facility or property of Parent or the Merger Subs
or any of their respective Subsidiaries);

 

(iv) changes or developments that are the result of factors generally
affecting any industry in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate;

(v) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened adverse
change in, the relationship of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with its

the extent resulting therefrom;

after the date hereof; and

 

(viii) any failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to meet any internal
or public projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for
any period, in and of itself, _provided_ that the exception in this clause
shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect
or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect;

_provided_ , _further_ , that (x) facts, events, changes,
effects, developments, circumstances or occurrences set forth in clauses (i)
through (iv) above may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been or is a Parent Material Adverse Effect to the extent such matters,
changes, effects or developments have a disproportionate and adverse effect
on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
entities engaged in the relevant business in Texas or other relevant
geographic area and (y) any condition or requirement attached to any order or
approval issued by the PUCT, FERC or FCC that is necessary or was sought in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and/or
the Plan of Reorganization shall not constitute, or be deemed to contribute
to, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(g) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, complaints, enforcement actions, penalty assessments, claims, hearings,
arbitrations, investigations, inquiries, audits or other proceedings (formal

that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or 

 



43  would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,

their respective businesses, assets or properties which, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

(h) _Available Funds_. Parent and Merger Subs currently have available to
them, and on or before the Effective Time, will have available to them, all
funds necessary to satisfy Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions required of them by this Agreement,
including funding the Cash Deposit Amount and the DIP Repayment. Parent and
Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Mergers, and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, is not conditional upon
the receipt by Parent or Merger Subs or availability of the proceeds of any
financing and that any failure by Parent or Merger Subs to consummate the
Mergers on the Closing Date (provided that at such time the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 are otherwise satisfied or are to
be satisfied at the Closing), by reason of absence of financing, shall
constitute a breach by Parent and/or Merger Subs of this Agreement.

 

(i) _Merger Subs_. All of the issued and outstanding membership interests of
the Merger Subs are validly issued and outstanding and are, and at the
Effective Time will be, directly or indirectly, owned by Parent. None of the
Merger Subs has conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time none of the Merger Subs will have any,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(j) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or any of the Merger Subs for which the Company could have
any liability prior to the Effective Time.

 

(k) _Taxes_. EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings Merger Sub are classified as
disregarded entities and divisions of EFH Merger Sub for federal income tax
purposes. Parent is classified as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. EFH Merger Sub is classified as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes.

 

(l) _Regulatory Status_. Parent is a public utility holding company under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (" _PUHCA_ "). None of the Merger
Subs is a public utility holding company under PUHCA. Neither Parent nor any
of the Merger Subs is a public utility under the Federal Power Act.

 

(m) _Oncor Entities_. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge that the ability
of the Company and EFIH to exercise control over the Oncor Entities, or cause
the Oncor Entities to take any action, is limited due to applicable Law
(including the Prior PUCT Order) and the provisions set forth in the Oncor
Agreements.

 



44 (n) _Claims_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries belongs to any Class
of Claims (as such terms are defined in the Plan of Reorganization) against
the E-Side Debtors.

 

(o) _Certain Subsidiaries_. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree
that, for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, none of the representations and warranties of the
Company and EFIH in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue, or fail to be
true, due to the existence of any liability of a Spin-Off Entity or any other
Subsidiary of the Company that will dissolve, liquidate, merge out of
existence or be abandoned in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and
applicable Law, in each case which will be fully and unconditionally
discharged at or prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization or otherwise.

 

(p) _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. EACH OF PARENT AND
THE MERGER SUBS (INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES)
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ANY
MATTER WHATSOEVER EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY THE
COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PARENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF OR
THE ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT, AND SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING) THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO (X) ANY
PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES OR BUDGETS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
DELIVERED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENT (OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES) OF FUTURE REVENUES, RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF), CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION
(OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF) OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR
(Y) THE FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES.

good faith (in each case, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, and based on advice of such counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and after such three (3)
Business Days the Company Board or the board of managers of EFIH, as the case
may be, may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_ or
_Section 8.3(f)_, as applicable and enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement, if concurrently with such termination, it determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and based on advice of such counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and, that as a result, the failure
to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. In
determining whether to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_
or _Section 8.3(f)_, the relevant board shall take into account all changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent after the date hereof in
response to such a Company Notice, and any other information deemed relevant
or appropriate by such board. The obligations set forth in this _Section
6.2(e)_ are in addition to those set forth in the other provisions of this
_Section 6.2_, including for the avoidance of doubt _Section 6.2(f)_.

(f) Following the entry of the Approval Order, the Company or EFIH shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable (i) and in any event before engaging in, or
continuing, any material discussions with any Person (or its Representatives)
who submits, or has submitted, an Acquisition Proposal, or providing material
information to such Person (or its Representatives), enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person (to the extent an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement is not already in effect with such Person), and
advise Parent in writing of each such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes to such material terms and conditions promptly after receipt thereof)
and provide

 



53  to Parent a copy of each Company Acquisition Agreement relating to such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of such Person and its Representatives;
(ii) make available to Parent and Merger Subs any material information that
it or its Representatives make available to each such Person described in
preceding clause (i) or its Representatives which was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Subs, concurrently with the making available of
such information to such Person or its Representatives; and (iii) inform
Parent and Merger Subs of any material developments with respect to each
Acquisition Proposal described in this sentence. The obligations set forth
in this _Section 6.2(f)_ shall apply with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal submitted before or after the date hereof, and the Company and EFIH
acknowledge and agree that, to the extent an Acquisition Proposal which meets
the requirements for discussions or other actions to occur as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ is submitted by or on behalf of a Person with whom
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has previously entered a
confidentiality agreement, such obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.2(f)_ may require an amendment to such agreement in order for such
Acquisition Proposal to be pursued by the Company or EFIH. To the extent that
Parent or any of its Affiliates receive the identity of any other potential
acquiror from the Company or EFIH pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the
recipient thereof shall maintain the confidentiality of such identity, and
shall only share such identity with its legal advisors for purposes of
receiving legal advice.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the period
beginning at the date of the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order and
continuing until the earlier of the Termination Date or the Closing Date, the
Company and EFIH and their Representatives shall have the right to: (x)
solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate Backup Plan Proposals,
including by way of providing access to non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; (y) enter into, maintain or continue discussions or
negotiations with respect to Backup Plan Proposals or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations; and (z) adopt, approve, recommend, or enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend, or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to (publicly or
otherwise) any such Backup Plan Proposal; _ provided_, __ _ however_, that
the Company and EFIH shall use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to keep
confidential any solicitation, negotiation, facilitation, and documentation
by any Debtor of a Backup Plan Proposal and (y) to enter into confidentiality
agreements with any counterparty to any agreement regarding support for and/or
financing of a Backup Plan Proposal, which confidentiality agreement provides
that the existence and terms of such Backup Plan Proposal shall be kept
confidential and shall not be publicly disclosed, except in each case to the
extent required by applicable Law.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and, solely to
the extent executed after the date of this Agreement, does not prohibit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing information to Parent that
Parent is expressly entitled to receive from the Company in accordance with
this _Section 6.2_.

 



54 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from or by a
Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective
agents and Representatives) with respect to (i) a merger, acquisition,
consolidation, dissolution, equitization, equity investment, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, plan of reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any other transaction involving the
Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries which results in the direct or
indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or in the direct or indirect acquisition
of more than 20% of the equity interests or voting power of the Company, EFIH
or any of the Oncor Entities _ provided, however_, that a Backup Plan
Proposal (as defined below) shall not constitute an Acquisition Proposal.

 

" _Backup Plan Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer that (i) would
constitute an Acquisition Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a
standalone plan of reorganization negotiated with existing creditors of the
Company or EFIH) and, (ii) by its terms, contemplates consummation or closing
of such Backup Plan Proposal only after termination of this Agreement other
than a termination arising as a result of the adoption, approval,
recommendation, or entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Backup Plan Proposal.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that
references to 20% shall be changed to 50%) which the Company Board or the
board of managers EFIH, as the case may be, determines in good faith would, if
consummated, result in a superior transaction to the Company or EFIH, as
applicable, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and based on advice of such counsel, and, taking into account (x) the
likelihood and timing of consummation and (y) all material legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), conditionality,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, in each case as compared to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights and obligations, each of the
Company, EFIH, Parent and the Merger Subs shall act reasonably and as promptly

Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization without giving the other party or its
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to participate in such meeting or
communication to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and to the
extent with respect to matters involving any of the Applications, unless

that Parent may not exclude the Company or EFIH from any such meeting or
communication if a Governmental Entity has requested that the Company or EFIH
participate, and in any event the parties hereto shall keep each other
reasonably apprised of all material substantive communications with
Governmental Entities of which they are aware regarding the

or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization;

 

(ii) with respect to the HSR Filing, obtaining the expiration or earlier
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the

consents of a Governmental Entity, obtaining all such necessary approvals
and avoiding the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment

restrict, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization, including Parent and Merger Subs, subject to the first
sentence of the last paragraph 

 



59  of _Section 6.3(e)_, taking all actions required by, and accepting all
conditions and/or requirements imposed under the terms of any, consent,
registration, order, approval or authorization issued by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Plan of Reorganization to the extent that any such condition or
requirement is a Key Regulatory Term or is not otherwise a Burdensome
Condition; and

(iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization unlawful or that would prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit,
or materially impair, restrain or restrict, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid, remove or comply with such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or enactment so as to permit prompt consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _Acceptable Conditions_. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, (A) Parent and the
Merger Subs shall not be required to, and (B) the Company, EFIH and their
Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities, subject to  _Section_ __ _
6.20)_ shall not be permitted to, without the prior written consent of Parent,

taking of such efforts or action, individually or in the aggregate, would
result in a Burdensome Condition.

" _Burdensome Condition_ " means any term or condition, order, sanction,
requirement, law, rule or regulation that, individually or in the aggregate,
would, or would be reasonably expected to have a material and adverse effect
on, or change in, the condition (financial or otherwise), business,

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as whole; _ provided_ that, for purposes of this clause (ii) Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated
group of entities that is the size and scale of the Oncor Entities; _
provided, however,_ __ that terms or conditions, orders, sanctions,
requirements, laws, rules or regulations that result in changes or
developments generally affecting electric transmission or distribution systems
in the State of Texas shall not be deemed to be, or contribute to, a
Burdensome Condition (except such changes or developments affecting electric
transmission or distribution systems in the State of Texas shall be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or is a Burdensome Condition to
the extent such changes, or developments have a disproportionate and adverse
effect on Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (where Parent and its Subsidiaries, including
the Oncor Entities, are deemed to be a consolidated group of entities that is
the size and scale of the

 



60  Oncor Entities), as compared to other entities engaged in the relevant
business in the State of Texas); _provided, further,_ that, the approval of
any of the Key Regulatory Terms, or any comparable condition, requirement or
similar item that, in each case, is substantively the same or results in the
same effect as any of the Key Regulatory Terms, by the PUCT shall not be
deemed to be, or contribute to, a Burdensome Condition, but adverse
variations or changes to any of the Key Regulatory Terms may contribute to, or
be, a Burdensome Condition.

Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent, Merger Subs or any of their
Affiliates to agree to the sale, license, divestiture, hold separate or other
disposition of any assets, categories of assets or businesses or other
segments of Parent or Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries). In the event that the Company or its
Subsidiaries are required to agree to the sale, license, divestiture, hold
separate or other disposition of any assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
obtaining a Company Approval, then such requirement may contribute to, or be,
a Burdensome Condition.

(f) _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all information
disclosed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall
require any party (i) to violate any of its binding obligations with respect
to confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any privileged information or (iii) to
violate any applicable Laws or Orders; _provided_ , that, as applicable, each
of the Company and EFIH, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger Subs, on
the other hand, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide
notice to each other that any information is being withheld pursuant to this
provision and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
find a mutually agreeable solution to any such confidentiality and/or
privilege concerns, including providing any such privileged information
pursuant to a joint defense agreement.

the E-Side Debtors, each agree that:

(i) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file a motion for entry
of the Approval Order on or before July 7, 2017, which motion, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall seek approval of, among other things, the
Termination Fee in favor of Parent pursuant to the terms hereof;

 

(ii) it shall use good faith efforts to file the Plan of Reorganization and

agreed to between Parent, on the one hand, and the Company and EFIH, on the
other hand);

 



61 (iii) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of
the Approval Order within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement;
provided that entry of such order shall be deemed to occur upon an oral
indication by the Bankruptcy Court that it is approving or will approve the
E-Side Debtors entry into and performance and agreement under this Agreement,

terms hereof;

 

(iv) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the

section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code;

(v) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the EFH

Reorganization

(vi) it shall use good faith efforts to negotiate and document definitive
documents and agreements governing the Plan of Reorganization and to take
such actions as the E-Side Debtors in good faith deem reasonable and
appropriate to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of such documents and
agreements as soon as reasonably practicable;

(vii) it shall not assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease
to which it is a party pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code without
the prior written consent of Parent, except as otherwise required by the Plan
of Reorganization;

 

(viii) it shall not establish any additional Supplemental Bar Dates (as
defined in the _Order (A)_ __ _ Setting a Supplemental Bar Date for Ninety

(ix) to the extent any E-Side Debtor has any right to vote or direct the vote
of any claims (as defined in 11 U.S.C. § 101(5)) against any other E-Side
Debtor, the Company or EFIH shall, or shall cause such E-Side Debtor, to vote
or direct such vote in favor of the Plan of Reorganization;

(x) it shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (a) provide to counsel
for Parent draft copies of all material motions, pleadings, and other
documents that any of the E-Side Debtors intend to file with any court or
regulatory body (including the Bankruptcy Court and the PUCT but excluding
the IRS) relating to this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization, or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at least three (3) Business
Days before the date on which such E-Side Debtor intends to file any such
document; provided, however, that the Company and EFIH shall provide to
counsel for Parent draft copies of the Disclosure Statement, solicitation

Order (as defined below), Approval Order,

 



62  and EFH Confirmation Order at least five (5) Business Days before the date
on which the E-Side Debtors intend to file any such document;
provided further, however, that Parent acknowledges such three (3) or five

all cases and that in such cases the filing party shall provide as much
advance notice as is reasonably practicable; and (b) incorporate all
reasonably requested comments, modifications, or amendments of Parent in any
such motion, pleading, or other document; provided further, however, that the
EFH Confirmation Order and Approval Order shall be in a form and substance
acceptable to Parent, and shall not be, in any respect that is materially
adverse to Parent, altered, amended, modified or supplemented without the
consent of Parent;

 

(xi) the E-Side Debtors and their Representatives shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (x) consult in advance with Parent to the extent reasonably
practicable, with respect to statements anticipated to be made on the record
in any court (including the Bankruptcy Court) or before any regulatory body
that are related to the Plan of Reorganization; and (y) consider in good
faith all reasonably requested comments, modifications, or amendments of
Parent in any such statement described in clause (x);

 

(xii) in the event that any order of any court (including the Bankruptcy
Court) or regulatory body (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
reasonably necessary to consummate the Plan of Reorganization and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is appealed or a stay pending
appeal is sought, the E-Side Debtors and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to oppose the appeal or the stay pending appeal and
seek the dismissal of any appeal; and

 

(xiii) the Company and EFIH shall not, and shall not cause any E-Side Debtor
to, without the prior written consent of Parent, request or apply for an

Termination Date and the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
contracts and records and, during such period, the Company and EFIH shall (and
each shall cause its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities) to) furnish
to Parent all such information concerning its business, properties,

that,_ no

 



63  investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall (a) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
(b) affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) permit any inspection,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or such Subsidiary would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any of its or any of its Subsidiaries obligations
with respect to confidentiality if the Company or such Subsidiary shall have
used reasonable best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does
not result in any such disclosure, including obtaining the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) disclose any privileged
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the Company or such
Subsidiary shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish such information
in a manner that does not result in the loss of such privilege or (iii)
permit any invasive environmental investigation or sampling, including a Phase
II environmental assessment. All information requested pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release or press releases regarding
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Closing Date Transactions, shall be in a form mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company and thereafter the Company, EFIH and Parent each shall
consult with each other to the extent reasonably practicable prior to issuing
any press releases or otherwise making public announcements (except as
required by Law) with respect to the Closing Date Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) On or prior to the date of the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, the Company and
EFIH took, and caused their respective Subsidiaries to take all such actions
within their control as were necessary, appropriate or desirable to transfer
the sponsorship, maintenance and administration of, and all liabilities (and
related contracts or agreements with third parties) in respect of, the
Contributed Plans to Vistra Energy or its Subsidiaries. Vistra Energy shall
transfer the liabilities related to the post-retirement health, life, dental
and vision benefits for participants previously employed by certain
discontinued operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
predecessors, and the participants beneficiaries previously disclosed to
Parent and the related accrued benefits liabilities (the " _DiscOp OPEB
Liabilities_ ") from the EFH Retiree Welfare Plan to a new mirror health and
welfare plan established by Vistra Energy or another plan reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _New DiscOp OPEB Plan_ ") which
such plan shall be transferred to and assumed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries prior to or on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, upon
the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan to the Company or its Subsidiary,
the New DiscOp OPEB Plan (including the DiscOp OPEB Liabilities) shall be an
Assumed Plan and the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Vistra Energy and its Subsidiaries from and against any claim,
action, suit, proceeding relating to any modification or termination of the
post-retirement health and life benefits to any DiscOp OPEB Participants on or
after the Closing Date. Parent, the Company and Vistra Energy shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan from
Vistra Energy to Parent or Company as soon as administratively practicable
following the

 



64  establishment of such plan, but in any event prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the period
beginning on the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off date and ending on the date the New
DiscOp OPEB Plan is assumed by the Company or its Subsidiary as set forth in
this _Section 6.6_, the Company, the EFH Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries shall reimburse Reorganized TCEH and its Affiliates for all
claims incurred by DiscOp OPEB Participants under the EFH Retiree Welfare Plan
or New DiscOp OPEB Plan, as applicable, plus any reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred by Reorganized TCEH and its Affiliates in providing such
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided herein
(including, without limitation, the Assumed Plans) or in the Split Participant
Agreement (as defined below), none of Parent, any Oncor Entity or any of
their Affiliates shall assume or otherwise incur any liability or obligation
under any compensatory, severance or similar arrangement in respect of any
Non-Oncor Employee (as defined below). For purposes of _Section 6.6(a)_:

" _Non-Oncor  Employee_" means consistent with past practices (i) any
individual employed by the Company, EFIH, TCEH, Reorganized TCEH or any of
their respective Affiliates (other than the Oncor Entities) on or immediately
following the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off or (ii) any individual formerly
employed by TCEH or any Affiliate of TCEH or Reorganized TCEH (which for this
purpose would constitute an Affiliate immediately following the Closing
Date), other than an Oncor Employee;

" _Oncor Employee_ " means consistent with past practices (i) any individual
employed by an Oncor Entity on or immediately following the Closing Date or
(ii) any individual formerly employed by an Oncor Entity or, by any
predecessor regulated electric utility business on a full time basis, who
terminated employment with and did not subsequently become employed by a non-
Oncor Entity; and

 

" _Split Participant Service_ " means service of Oncor Employees or Non-Oncor
Employees, as applicable, whose employment includes service with both the
Oncor Entities (or a predecessor regulated electric business) and a business
of the Company or its Affiliates other than the Oncor Entities.

(b) EFIH, the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain unconditional approval of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing the
termination and distribution of all payments and obligations under the
Discharged Plans (other than any such Discharged Plans that are equity based
plans or the Ebasco Services of Canada Limited Pension Plan) prior to the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified
Plans are to be discharged; _provided_ , _however_ , if EFIH, the Company and
Parent cannot obtain such unconditional approval of the Bankruptcy Court
prior to such date, such Discharged Plans will be terminated as the effective
date of the Plan of Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified Plans are
to be discharged and paid out and all associated liabilities discharged in
accordance with the terms and procedures of such Plan of Reorganization.

 



65 (c) [RESERVED]

 

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall obligate Parent or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities)
after the Closing Date.

 

(e) The Company and Parent agree to cooperate in good faith using commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the risk of any Contributed Plan and Assumed
Plan becoming a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of
the Code) or "multiple employer welfare plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA) following the Closing Date.

(f) The Company and Parent agree to work together in good faith to develop
such timelines, plans, agreements, and communications, and to exchange such
information as is necessary to effectuate the intent of this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ in an orderly manner.

 

(g) For a period of ninety (90) days immediately following the Closing Date,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Companies shall close any facility or lay
off any Employees of the Surviving Companies or its Subsidiaries, if such
closure or layoff would result in any material obligations or liabilities for
Reorganized TCEH.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former Employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be (i) construed
as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose, or (ii) give any
employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or
any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any
right to enforce the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Merger Subs, Vistra Energy or any of their respective
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or refrain from
amending or terminating any benefit plan, except as provided otherwise in the
Split Participant Agreement or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

 

Section 6.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
6.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.21_

of Reorganization, whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

 

Section 6.8 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, the EFH
Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the EFH Surviving Company
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided that_ , the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification),

 



66  each present and former director, manager and officer of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable and necessary attorneys fees and
experts fees), and sums which an Indemnified Party becomes legally obligated
to pay solely as a result of judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
settlements or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") arising out of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Parties service as a manager, director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or other services performed by such persons at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that the EFH Surviving Company shall not indemnify any Indemnified Party for
any Costs brought about or contributed to in fact by fraudulent act by
such Indemnified Party; and _provided, further_ , that the EFH Surviving
Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any Indemnified Party for any
Costs unless and until such Indemnified Party has exhausted the limits of
recovery from any other Person obligated to indemnify and reimburse such
Indemnified Party (unless the Company has agreed otherwise in writing prior to
the date hereof with any such other Person, in which case this proviso shall
be limited with respect to such other Person to the extent of such
agreement).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, effective as of the
Effective Time, and fully pay the premium for a run-off of (i) the Companys
and its Subsidiaries existing directors, managers and officers insurance
policies as of the date hereof, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim based on alleged acts or omissions
occurring during any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood that, with respect to any claim arising from actual or
alleged acts or omissions of such Persons in their capacity as a current or
former director or officer or other Representative of any of TCEH Companies or
the SpinCo Group (each as defined in the Separation Agreement), such period
shall be limited to the period on or prior to the TCEH Effective Date) from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a current or former director or officer or other
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or
her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement). If the Company, after
its good faith efforts to obtain, is unable to obtain such run-off insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the EFH Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the EFH Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are

 



67  no less advantageous than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the EFH Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the EFH Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the EFH Surviving
Company be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an
annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the EFH
Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If the EFH Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall
(i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the EFH Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or formation or bylaws, operating agreement or
comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now
existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of
formation, bylaws, operating agreement or comparable governing documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be continued or be assumed by the EFH Surviving Company
following the EFH Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of
any such Indemnified Party for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time.

 

Section 6.9 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, except as otherwise may be agreed by Parent in writing, the
Company Board, all officers of the Company and all members of any board of
directors or similar governing body and all officers of any Subsidiary of the
Company (other than the Oncor Entities), in each case who are in
office immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be deemed to have
resigned from such position(s) effective at the Effective Time. In addition,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, EFIH shall cause the Member Directors
(as defined in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement) to resign.

 



68 Section 6.10 _Parent Cooperation_. Parent agrees that:

 

(a) it shall use its good faith efforts to negotiate the documents necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Restructuring Documents_ ") in good faith and to take such actions as
are reasonably requested by the E-Side Debtors or as Parent in good faith
deems reasonable and appropriate to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the
Restructuring Documents as soon as reasonably practicable;

 

(b) it shall use good faith efforts to assist in obtaining (i) entry of the
Bankruptcy Court order approving the disclosure statement and other
solicitation materials in support of the Plan of Reorganization (the "
_Disclosure Statement Order_ "), the Approval Order, and the EFH Confirmation
Order, and (ii) consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable
in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and on terms consistent with this
Agreement, including within the timeframes contemplated in this Agreement;

(c) it shall not directly or indirectly, or encourage any other entity to
directly or indirectly: (i) object to, delay, impede, or take any other
action or any inaction to interfere with the acceptance, implementation,
consummation, or amendment (whether before or after confirmation) of the Plan
of Reorganization; or (ii) propose, file, support, vote for, or take any
other action in furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, by making or supporting any filings with the Bankruptcy
Court or any regulatory agency, including the PUCT, the IRS, the FCC, and the
FERC, or by entering into any agreement or making or supporting any filing,
press release, press report or comparable public statement, with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may file with the Bankruptcy Court all documents
necessary to obtain approval of this Agreement and entry of the Approval
Order;

 

(d) it shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain required
regulatory and/or third-party approvals (including from the PUCT, the IRS,
the FCC, and the FERC, as applicable), and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in obtaining (A) Bankruptcy Court approval of the
Restructuring Documents and entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, and (B)
entry of the Disclosure Statement Order, the Approval Order, and the EFH
Confirmation Order, and any other order of the Bankruptcy Court (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) reasonably necessary to consummate the
Plan of Reorganization and all other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and on terms consistent with
this Agreement; and

 

(e) If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ or (ii) by the Company/EFIH in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ of the Agreement and upon entry of the Approval Order,
then neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
or encourage any other entity to, directly or indirectly, (A) object to,
delay, impede, or take any other action or any inaction to interfere with the
acceptance, implementation, consummation or amendment (whether

 



69  before or after confirmation, provided that such amendment was made
consistent with this Agreement) of an Acquisition Proposal; or (B) propose,
file, support, or take any other action in furtherance of any restructuring,
workout, plan of arrangement, or plan of reorganization for the Debtors
(including the Plan of Reorganization and the transactions contemplated
therein) other than an Acquisition Proposal, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, making or supporting any filings with the Bankruptcy Court or any
regulatory agency, including the PUCT or the FERC, or making or supporting any
public statements with respect to any restructuring, workout, plan of
arrangement, or plan of reorganization for the Debtors other than any such
plan or restructuring described in clause (A) above. Neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be prohibited or restricted from taking any actions that
they determine in their reasonable discretion are necessary or appropriate,
including intervening in any proceedings before or making or supporting any
filings with the PUCT, in order (x) to preserve and protect their business,
operations, goodwill or assets or (y) based on the advice of counsel, to
fulfill the contractual, legal or other duties and obligations that any such
Person has in respect of any such business, operations, goodwill or assets.

 

Section 6.11 _RESERVED_.

 

Section 6.12 _Waiver_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Investor Rights Agreement or the Oncor LLC Agreement, the Company and EFIH
hereby agree, on behalf of themselves and their Subsidiaries, that Parent and
its Affiliates may pay a greater amount of cash consideration than the
consideration to be paid under this Agreement (on a per unit basis) to the
Minority Member (or its Permitted Transferees) (as such terms are defined in
the Investor Rights Agreement), at such time as Parent deems appropriate, to
trigger and enforce the Drag-Along Rights and satisfy the IRR Hurdle (as
defined below).

 

Section 6.13 _Tax Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement intend that the
EFH Merger will not cause a failure of the Intended Tax-Free Treatment of the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off.

 

Section 6.14 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Private Letter Ruling_. The Company, on behalf of the Debtors, has
received a private letter ruling (the " _Private Letter Ruling_ ") from the
IRS in response to a written request, dated June 10, 2014 (the " _Initial
Ruling Request_ ," and together with all related materials and supplements
thereto filed with respect to the Initial Ruling Request, the " _Initial IRS
Submissions_ "). The Private Letter Ruling addresses certain issues related to
the qualification of the Reorganized TCEH Contributions, the Reorganized TCEH
Conversion, and the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the Code (collectively,
the " _Intended Tax-Free Treatment_") and certain other matters. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Private Letter Ruling is acceptable to
the parties hereto with respect to the Intended Tax-Free Treatment.
The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not conditioned on the
receipt of any additional rulings from the IRS, other than the Supplemental
Rulings (defined below).

 



70 (b) _Supplemental Ruling_. The Company has prepared and filed with the IRS
a supplemental ruling request, dated November 3, 2016, that, among other
things, requests rulings that address the effect of the Companys previously
contemplated merger with a direct wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy,
Inc., a Florida Corporation, on certain of the rulings received in the
Private Letter Ruling (the " _Prior Supplemental Ruling Request_ "). The
Company shall be responsible for the preparation and filing with the IRS of
one or more supplemental ruling requests, whether in the form of modifying
the Prior Supplement Ruling Request or in the form of a new request, that,
among other things, request rulings that address the effect of the Mergers on
certain of the rulings received in the Private Letter Ruling as reflected on
_Exhibit_ __ _ H_ (such request, the " _Supplemental Ruling Request_ ," the
rulings to be granted pursuant thereto, the " _Supplemental Rulings_ ," and
the materials filed or to be filed in respect of the Supplemental Ruling
Request, the " _Supplemental IRS Submissions_ " and together with the Initial
IRS Submissions, the " _IRS Submissions_ ").

 

(c) _Supplemental IRS Submissions_. The Company shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of the Supplemental IRS Submissions. The Company shall
provide tax counsel of Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on drafts of all such IRS Submissions and any pre-filing agreement or
closing agreement that is intended to satisfy the requirements of _Section_
__ _ 7.1(d)_ or that could reasonably be determined to affect the treatment
of the restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan
of Reorganization to be submitted or entered into on or after the date
hereof. The Company agrees to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS
Submissions and agreements related to Supplemental IRS Submissions as may be
reasonably requested by Parent;  _provided_ , _ however_, that the Company
shall not be required to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS Submission,
request any additional ruling, or modify any ruling being requested with
respect to the Supplemental Rulings (other than with respect to the effect of
the EFH Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) if the
Company determines, in its reasonable discretion, that making such supplement,
modification, or request could result in any delay in obtaining the
Supplemental Rulings or be otherwise detrimental to the process of obtaining
the Supplemental Rulings. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it is
anticipated that this Agreement and the facts related to the contemplated
EFH Merger will be disclosed to the IRS pursuant to a Supplemental IRS
Submission. To the extent that the Company, in its good faith judgment, or
upon a reasonable request by any other person, considers any information
included in an IRS Submission or a Supplemental IRS Submission (or drafts
thereof) to be confidential, the Company may redact such documents to exclude
such information before providing such documents to Parent. Subject to the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with copies of each Supplemental
IRS Submission promptly following the filing thereof.

(d) _IRS Communications and Cooperation_. The Company shall notify Parent of
any substantive communications with the IRS regarding the Supplemental IRS
Submissions and restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
by the Plan of Reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single
Representative from Parent shall be given the opportunity to participate in
all scheduled communications with the IRS concerning the Supplemental Ruling
Requests or any restructuring transactions 

 



71  contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization, including,
(i) all scheduled conference calls that are expected to address material
issues with respect to which there is sufficient prior notice and the IRS
indicates its acceptance of multiple participants and (ii) all in-person
meetings. The Company shall update Parent in a timely fashion regarding any
unscheduled communications from the IRS or any other communication with
respect to which a Representative of Parent does not participate. The Company
and Parent agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to assist
in obtaining the rulings requested in the Supplemental Ruling Requests
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the requested rulings, if any, that
are not Fundamental Rulings described on _Exhibit H_ ), including providing
such appropriate information and representations as the IRS shall reasonably
require in connection with the Supplemental Rulings or any restructuring
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization.
The Company and Parent agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide any appropriate information and additional representations necessary
or appropriate in connection with the Supplemental Rulings. The Company and
Parent agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to implement any
changes to the restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
by the Plan of Reorganization to the extent such changes would not, unless
otherwise agreed by Parent, result in a material economic detriment to Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries if requested by the
IRS in order to issue reasonably satisfactory Supplemental Rulings; _provided,
however_ , that this sentence shall not apply to any changes to the
restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan of
Reorganization addressed by _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ of this Agreement, with
respect to which the terms of _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ of this Agreement shall
govern.

 

(e) _Tax Opinion_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_, if applicable, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion contemplated by _Section_ __ _
7.2(e)_, if applicable.

 

(f) _Tax Matters Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) consent to any amendment to
the Tax Matters Agreement or waive any of its or its Affiliates rights
thereunder or (ii) take or fail to take any action that would constitute a
breach of the Tax Matters Agreement.

 

Section 6.15 _RESERVED_.

 

Section 6.16 _Transition Services Agreement_ _; Separation Agreement_. The
Company and Reorganized TCEH duly executed and delivered a Transition
Services Agreement, dated October 3, 2016 (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ "). The Company and Reorganized TCEH and OpCo (as defined in the
Separation Agreement) duly executed and delivered the Separation Agreement,
dated October 3, 2016 (the " _Separation Agreement_ "), in accordance with the
Plan of Reorganization. Following the execution of the Separation Agreement,
the Company (i) has used and shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply

Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing upon becoming aware of any (i)
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of the other party to effect the Closing not to be satisfied; (ii)
written notice from any third party (other than a notice that has been
previously identified pursuant to the Company Disclosure Letter) alleging
that the consent of such party is or may be required in connection with the
Closing Date Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization; and (iii) written notice of any
proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or Parent, threatened
against the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (other than the
Oncor Entities), that has had or would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to either party, and the failure to deliver any such notice shall
not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

Section 6.18 _Drag-Along Rights_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Offer
(together with this Agreement to the extent referred to therein) constitutes
an offer by Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings Merger
Sub to purchase (i) all of the LLC Units in Oncor held indirectly by the
Company and (ii) all of the LLC Units in Oncor that are owned by Oncor
Management and by TTI as provided for in Section 3.3(a) of the Investor Rights
Agreement.

(b) So long as Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings
Merger Sub have not (x) rescinded the Offer or (y) amended or modified the
Offer in a manner that violates the Investor Rights Agreement, at any time
following the receipt of a written request from Parent and prior to the

such term is defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company and consistent with Section

Agreement in connection with (i) this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, (ii) the Offer
or (iii) delivery of the Required Sale Notice to TTI, shall be paid, or
reimbursed, by Parent in immediately available funds within thirty (30) days
after termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (1) except
if the Company or EFIH terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, in which event no amounts shall be
payable by Parent, and (2) other than any Costs arising from a material breach
by the Company or EFIH of its obligations under this Agreement (including
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_) with respect to
such matters or from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company
or EFIH in connection with such matters.

 



73 (d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
Costs suffered or reasonably incurred by them in connection with (i) this
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_, (ii) the Offer, or (iii) the Required Sale
Notice, other than any Costs arising from a material breach by the Company or
EFIH of its respective obligations under this Agreement (including under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.19_) with respect to such matters
or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or EFIH in
connection with such matters.

(e) Parent and the Merger Subs shall be responsible for their own Costs in
connection with (i) this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, (ii) the Offer or (iii)

Section 6.19 _Enforcement of Certain Investor Rights_.

 

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Merger Subs
shall use reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute definitive
documentation with TTI (or, if applicable, its equityholders) providing for
the acquisition of the Minority Interest as of the Closing Date as described
in the Offer and otherwise on terms to be mutually agreed by Parent, EFH
Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub and TTI (or, if
applicable, its equityholders). Solely to the extent that, at any time after
the date that is thirty (30) days from the date on which the Required Sale
Notice is delivered in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, (x) neither
Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub nor an
Affiliate of Parent has executed definitive documentation with TTI (or, if
applicable, its equityholders) providing for the acquisition of the Minority
Interest, (y) Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings
Merger Sub have complied, in all material respects, with their obligations
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19(a)_ and (z) Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH
Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings Merger Sub have neither rescinded the Offer nor
amended or modified the Offer in a manner that violates the Investor
Rights Agreement, Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub or Oncor Holdings
Merger Sub shall be entitled to send a written notice to the Company
requesting that the Company commence an Enforcement Action (as defined below).
The parties hereto hereby agree that Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub
and Oncor Holdings Merger Sub shall have complied with their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.19(a)_ to the extent Parent, EFH
Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub or an Affiliate of
Parent has made and not rescinded a good faith offer to TTI consistent with
the Offer and otherwise made good faith efforts to propose the basis for
negotiations and propose draft definitive documentation providing for the
acquisition of the Minority Interest as of the Closing Date consistent with
the terms of the Offer.

(b) Promptly following, and in no case more than fourteen (14) Business Days
after, the delivery of the written notice described in _Section_ __ _
6.19(a)_, the Company shall file an action (the " _Enforcement Action_ ") in
the Bankruptcy Court (or, if the Bankruptcy Court issues a final order
confirming that it does not have jurisdiction over the

 



74  Enforcement Action, another appropriate court mutually agreed in good faith
by the Company and Parent) that seeks any or all of the following remedies (as
determined by consultation among the parties hereto, but including, at a
minimum, the remedies described in clauses (i) and (ii) below): (i) a
determination that the Company has the right to enforce the Drag-Along Rights
and TTI is accordingly bound to consummate the sale of the Minority Interest
at or after the Closing, (ii) a determination regarding the interpretation and
methodology to determine whether the total payments TTI would receive based on
the Drag-Along Rights will satisfy the IRR Hurdle, as set forth in the
Investor Rights Agreement (and as defined therein), (iii) a determination, if
applicable, that TTI has failed to comply with its obligations under the
Investor Rights Agreement with respect to the Drag-Along Rights
contained therein, (iv) enforcement of any other obligations of TTI arising
under the Investor Rights Agreement or Oncor LLC Agreement, in each case
solely relating to the matters described in clause (i) and/or (ii) above, and
(v) any other remedy available to the Company at law or in equity in
connection with such matters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
have no obligation to bring any other action (whether in law, equity or
otherwise) against TTI pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_; _provided,
however_ , that, to the extent that TTI or any of its Affiliates commences any
action relating to the matters identified in this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_
against the E-Side Debtors or any of their Affiliates, the Company or such
other Person shall as promptly as practicable seek to remove any such action
to the Bankruptcy Court and, to the extent applicable, seek to enforce
the automatic stay against such action pending removal. The Enforcement
Action (and the obligations of the Company included in this _Section_ __ _
6.19_ in connection with the Enforcement Action) also shall include the
obligation of the Company to defend any remedy or determination described in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.19(b)_ to the extent any such remedy or determination
is challenged on appeal. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided herein, the remedies sought in the
Enforcement Action shall not be deemed to modify the closing conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(f)_.

 

(c) The Enforcement Action shall be conducted by the Company with counsel
selected by the Company, in its reasonable discretion, which may include
Kirkland and Ellis LLP. To the extent that Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger
Sub and/or Oncor Holdings Merger Sub move to intervene in and otherwise
participate in the Enforcement Action, at their own cost and expense and with
their own counsel (which may include Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, LLP), the
Company and EFIH shall not oppose such motion, or knowingly take any action
with the intent of preventing, restricting or hindering Parent, EFH
Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub or Oncor Holdings Merger Sub from intervening and
participating in the Enforcement Action, and shall support their right to
intervene in the Enforcement Action for any and all purposes related to the
Enforcement Action (including related counterclaims) with full rights of
participation.

(d) To the extent that, after the commencement of the Enforcement Action, (i)
none of Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub or
an Affiliate of Parent has executed definitive documentation with TTI (or, if
applicable, its equityholders) providing for the acquisition of the Minority
Interest, (ii) Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings
Merger Sub have complied, in all material respects, with their obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ and (iii) neither Parent, EFH 

 



75  Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub nor Oncor Holdings Merger Sub has neither
rescinded the Offer nor amended or modified the Offer in a manner that
violates the Investor Rights Agreement, the Company shall prosecute the
Enforcement Action diligently until entry of a final order resolving the
Enforcement Action in its entirety. Subject to the terms of this _Section_ __
_ 6.19_, the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
attorneys and advisors to) cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary or advisable to achieve a Successful Outcome (as
defined below) of the Enforcement Action, including preparing and filing all
documentation reasonably required in connection therewith. A "Successful
Outcome" means obtaining the applicable remedies referred to in clauses (i)
through (iv) of _Section_ __ _ 6.19(b)_ or entering into a settlement or
compromise of the Enforcement Action as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.19(f)_.

 

(e) In connection with the Enforcement Action, the Company and EFIH shall (i)
provide Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub
and their designated advisors with a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance and provide comments to any material filings made in connection
therewith, and consider those comments in good faith, (ii) reasonably consult
with, and consider in good faith the views of, Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH
Merger Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub and their designated counsel in
connection with the prosecution, defense and/or settlement of
such Enforcement Action and (iii) allow Parent, EFH Merger Sub, EFIH Merger
Sub, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub and their designated legal advisors to attend,
and, if permitted by applicable Law (and only if appropriate agreements are
entered into designed to minimize the risk of waiving, and with the intention
of maintaining, any privilege or work product doctrine), participate in, all
material meetings, communications and proceedings with respect to such
Enforcement Action. Without limitation to the foregoing sentence, the Company
shall consult with, and consider in good faith the views of, Parent, EFH
Merger Sub, EFIH Merger Sub and Oncor Holdings Merger Sub regarding all
material strategic decisions relating to the conduct of the Enforcement
Action, and Parent shall be entitled to set the timing for the filing of any
summary judgment or other dispositive motion and for any trial or other
significant hearing; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything
to contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, the Company shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action proposed by Parent that it reasonably
determines (based on the advice of its counsel) is (A) likely to have a
material and adverse effect on the ability of the Company and/or EFIH to
effectuate the Closing Date Transactions or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or in the Plan of Reorganization, or (B) inconsistent with
its board of directors applicable fiduciary duties. Subject to the
limitations set forth in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.19(d)_, the
Company shall, and shall direct its counsel to, use reasonable best efforts to
take all steps to prosecute the Enforcement Action as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including filing motions with the court, as appropriate, to seek
a ruling on expedited treatment for the Enforcement Action, and Parent
(including designated legal counsel and other advisors) shall use its and
their reasonable best efforts to support and assist the Company in fulfilling
its obligations with respect to the Enforcement Action.

 



76 (f) Without limiting any other provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, the
Company shall not settle or compromise any Enforcement Action or consent to
the entry of any order in connection therewith without the prior written
consent of Parent (in its sole discretion). Parent shall be entitled to cause
the Company to settle or compromise any Enforcement Action or consent to the
entry of any order in connection therewith without the consent of the Company
so long as (i) any such settlement or compromise, and any payment obligations
in connection therewith, shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing
and (ii) Parent provides advance notice of at least five (5) Business Days to
the Company of the proposed terms of such settlement or compromise and the
Company does not notify Parent in writing within such five (5) Business Day
period that the Company has reasonably determined (based on the advice of its
counsel) that such settlement or compromise (A) is likely to have a material
and adverse effect on the ability of the Company and/or EFIH to effectuate
the Closing Date Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
in the Plan of Reorganization, or (B) is inconsistent with its board of
directors applicable fiduciary duties.

(g) The Company shall cause its counsel to track separately all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Enforcement Action as part of its
ongoing fee application process. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_, the Company shall invoice Parent for all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses incurred by it and its Affiliates in connection
with the Enforcement Action on a monthly basis and such invoices shall be
payable by Parent in immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (except if the
Company or EFIH terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, in which event no amounts shall be payable by
Parent).

 

(h) In addition, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all Costs suffered or reasonably incurred as a result of actions taken
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, to the extent such actions are taken
during the period from the date of this Agreement to its termination in
accordance with its terms except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ and other than any Costs
arising from a material breach by the Company or EFIH of its respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ or from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company in connection with the Enforcement Action.

 

(i) If requested by Parent, the Company, EFIH and their respective advisors
shall promptly consent to, execute and deliver to Parent a mutually agreeable
common interest or joint defense or prosecution agreement regarding the
defense and/or prosecution of any Enforcement Action that is consistent with
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Enforcement Action" shall include any appeals therefrom.

Section 6.20 _Oncor Entities_.

(a) Each of the Company and EFIH covenants that it will exercise its rights to
consent and vote (if any) under the Oncor Agreements as direct or indirect
equity owners of the Oncor Entities in a manner intended to cause the Oncor
Entities to comply with each of their respective covenants and agreements set
forth in the Oncor Letter 

 



77  Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement and under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and
agree that neither the Company nor EFIH shall be required, in connection with
such partys obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.20_, and their
reasonable best efforts shall not include any obligation, to (A) pay any
amounts to the Oncor Entities or any other Person or incur any liabilities or
other obligation, (B) execute or enter into or perform any new agreement
(other than an agreement contemplated hereby or in the Plan of Reorganization
or that confirms or makes effective its obligations hereunder), or (C) breach
any Law or commence any Action against any Person, including any of the Oncor
Entities or their respective officers and managers, other than the Enforcement
Action.

 

(b) Each of the Company and EFIH shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to not permit Oncor Holdings to take, or permit Oncor
to take, any of the actions set forth in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement or
the Oncor LLC Agreement, in each case that require the approval or consent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any asset swap
for substantially similar value by Oncor (as reasonably determined by Oncor,
the Company and EFIH) approved by the PUCT.

Section 6.21  _Financing_.

(a) Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided the Company with a
description of the potential debt financing (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and
equity issuance, including the potential equity issuance of Parent Preferred
Stock as described in _Section_ __ _ 1._ _8_ (the " _Equity Financing_ "
and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ") it may incur in
order to raise proceeds to be used to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date and the Termination Date, the Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to timely provide, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Subsidiaries (other than Oncor Entities, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.20_)
and their respective officers and employees to timely provide, reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing; provided
that, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the Company with
notice of any information needed by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Companys reasonable best efforts contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
6.21_ include the following: (i) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials for rating agencies and rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing,
together with procuring customary authorization letters authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors (which
customary authorization letters shall be required notwithstanding the
reasonable best efforts standard required of the Company above); (ii)
furnishing (x) all information and data reasonably requested by Parent to
prepare all pro forma financial statements required to be prepared, or
otherwise customary in connection with, the Financings registered on
Form S-1, Form S-4 or other available Form (as applicable) and (y) all
financial statements and financial data of the type and form required to be
prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act for offerings of the debt and/or equity securities (as the case
may be) contemplated in the respective Financings registered on Form S-1,
Form S-4 or other available Form (as applicable)

 



78  under the Securities Act, including all information required to be
incorporated therein; _provided_ , that, if no registration statement is
required to be filed for each of the Financings, for each such Financing,
such information, data, financial statements and financial data shall be
furnished to the extent customary to consummate the Financing (subject to
exceptions customary for a private Rule 144A offering) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, would not require financial information otherwise
required by Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or "segment reporting"
and any Compensation Discussion and Analysis or executive compensation
information required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K; (iii) furnishing Parent
and the lenders and investors for such Financing or their respective
Affiliates promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to an Early Financing Date (as defined below) or the Closing Date, as
applicable, with all documentation and other information which any lender or
investor providing or arranging the Financing has reasonably requested,
including under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act in each case to the extent
such request is made at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Early
Financing Date or the Closing Date, as applicable; (iv) providing customary
management representation letters to the independent accountants and using
reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys independent auditors to
cooperate in connection with the Financing (including providing accountants
comfort letters and consents to use their audit reports from the
Companys independent auditors to the extent required in connection with such
Financing); (v) obtaining customary payoff letters, releases of liens and
other instruments of termination or discharge reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with the repayment of indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than Oncor Entities) as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization; and
(vi) otherwise cooperating with Parent to satisfy any express conditions
precedent to the Financing within the control of the Company, provided in each
case (A) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection
with the Financing prior to the Closing Date, (C) other than customary
authorization letters, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors, or employees shall be required to execute or
enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
Date, (D) Persons who are on the board of directors or the board of managers
(or similar governing body) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing Date in their capacity as such shall not be required to pass
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Financing, and (E) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors, or employees shall be required to execute any solvency
certificate in connection with the Financing. Nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.21_(a) or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Financing.

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Termination Date
and the Closing Date, it is understood that Parent may seek to market and
consummate all or a portion of the Financing (the date of any such issuance,
an "Early Financing Date"). In this regard, and for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company and EFIH acknowledge that their cooperation obligations set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 6.21_(a) include the obligation to use their reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with any such efforts, provided such cooperation
obligations are limited to those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.21_(a).

 



79 (c) Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action
that would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any
cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.21_ or any information
utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.21_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon request of the
Company if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including those of its Representatives), in connection with the
cooperation required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.21_. The Company hereby
consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the consummation by
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization is not conditional upon the consummation of, or the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates of the proceeds of, the
Financing.

 

Section 6.22 _Amendment to PUCT Filing_. If the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(f)(ii)_ has been satisfied, but the TTI Minority Interest
Acquisition will not, or is not reasonably likely to, occur at or prior to
Closing, then Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult and work
with the PUCT to promptly amend the PUCT Filing (including making changes to
the Key Regulatory Terms contained therein) as may be required by the PUCT to
account for the fact that Parent will not directly or indirectly own TTIs
interest in Oncor as of the Effective Time; _provided_  that, for the
avoidance of doubt, (a) Parent shall not be required to take any action(s) in
connection therewith if the taking of such action(s), individually or in the
aggregate, would result in a Burdensome Condition and (b) none of the rights
or privileges held by TTI (or any successor thereto) under the Investor Rights
Agreement or Oncor LLC Agreement shall be considered (or contribute to) a
Burdensome Condition, but any adverse variations or changes to any of such
rights or privileges may contribute to, or be, a Burdensome Condition. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.22, the fact that the need to amend the PUCT Filing arose in whole
or in part due to such rights and privileges held by TTI (or any successor
thereto) shall not be deemed to limit in any way the determination as to
whether any such amendments or changes required by the PUCT constitute a
Burdensome Condition, other than to the extent such amendments or changes
merely preserve or restate the existing rights and privileges held by TTI (or
any successor thereto).

 



80 ARTICLE VII

 

Conditions

 

Section 7.1 _Conditions to All Parties_ __ _Obligations_. The obligations of
each party to effect the Closing are subject to the satisfaction or mutual
waiver (as determined by the Company and, to the extent EFIH would be
adversely affected by the Companys actions, EFIH, on the one hand, and by
Parent, on the other hand) of the following conditions at or prior to the
Closing:

(a) _Bankruptcy Orders_. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered (in a form
which is not materially inconsistent, in any substantive legal or economic
respect, with the rights and obligations of the Company or EFIH or Parent or
the Merger Subs hereunder or in the Plan of Reorganization) (i) the order of
the Bankruptcy Court approving this Agreement, including, among other things,
approval of the Termination Fee and the Companys and EFIHs entry into and
performance of their obligations under this Agreement and the related
agreements (the " _Approval Order_ ") and (ii) an order, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, confirming the Plan of Reorganization with respect to
the E-Side Debtors and authorizing all of the transactions and agreements
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _EFH Confirmation Order_ "), which in
each case shall be in full force and not subject to any stay.

 

(b) _Orders_. No court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains,
enjoins, renders illegal or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Closing
Date Transactions.

 

(c) _Opinion of Counsel with respect to the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off_. The
tax opinion of Kirkland and Ellis LLP obtained by the Company on October 3,
2016 to the effect that the Reorganized TCEH Contributions, Reorganized TCEH
Conversion and Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off meet the requirements of Sections
368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the Code shall not have been revoked, rescinded
or modified in any respect (except as consented to in writing by Parent).

 

(d) _[RESERVED]_

 

(e) _No Liabilities other than Legacy Claims and Limited Real Property Tax
Liens_. Assuming the Closing Date Transactions are consummated, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities) will have
any indebtedness for borrowed money immediately following the Effective Time.
Under the Plan of Reorganization (and subject to the treatment of Claims
provided therein), at the Effective Time (and after giving effect to all of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization), all Administrative Claims, DIP Claims and Claims (each as
defined in the Plan of Reorganization), other than the Legacy General
Unsecured Claims Against the EFH Debtors (as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization), property tax

 



81  Claims secured by liens on real property in an amount not to exceed $100,000
and other claims that are non-dischargeable under section 1141(d)(6) under
the Bankruptcy Code, will no longer be obligations of the E-Side Debtors and
will be paid only from the Accessible Account Deposit as provided in the Plan
of Reorganization; provided, however, the Company shall pay any such Claims
secured by liens on real property in full from the Accessible Account Deposit
in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

 

(f) _Private Letter Rulings_. The Private Letter Ruling shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not have been revoked, withdrawn or amended and
the Supplemental Rulings shall have been obtained by the Company from the IRS
in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent; _provided, however_ , that (A) a
particular ruling that, in the reasonable determination of Parent covers
substantially the same subject matter as any one or more of the Supplemental
Rulings set forth in _Exhibit H_ shall not be grounds for concluding that the
Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not reasonably satisfactory to Parent
due to its failure to include such ruling, (B) in the event a specific
Supplemental Ruling set forth in _Exhibit H_ is not given because the IRS
communicates that there is no significant issue with respect to the requested
ruling, the absence of such ruling shall not, standing alone (or collectively)
be grounds for concluding the Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not
reasonably satisfactory to Parent _provided_ that Parent, and unless waived
by Parent, the Company, obtain an opinion of nationally recognized tax
counsel, in form and substance acceptable to Parent, at a "will" level with
respect to the issue that was initially requested pursuant to the Supplemental
Ruling Request, or (C) a pre-filing agreement (including an agreement in
accordance with Revenue Procedure 2016-30) or closing agreement with the IRS
shall be acceptable in lieu of such specific Supplemental Ruling set forth in
_Exhibit H_ , _provided_ that such agreement is both (i) binding on the IRS to
the same degree as a private letter ruling or is otherwise acceptable to
Parent in its reasonable discretion and (ii) contains, in the reasonable
determination of Parent conclusions that are substantially similar, and have
substantially the same practical effect, to those contained in the specific
rulings initially requested pursuant to the Supplemental Ruling Requests.

(g) _SEC Registration_. The shares of Parent stock that may be issuable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ of this Agreement shall be freely saleable
and not subject to any resale restrictions except to the extent such
restrictions are due to the status of the holder thereof, and shall be
issuable either pursuant to (i) the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and from applicable state securities laws
provided by Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code or (ii) a Form S-4, or
other registration statement, as applicable, that shall have become and
continue to be effective under the Securities Act and shall not be the subject
of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order, and Parent shall have
received the state securities or "blue sky" authorizations necessary for the
issuance of the shares of Parent stock.

 



82 Section 7.2 _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and the Merger Sub_ _s_.
The obligations of Parent and the Merger Subs to effect the Closing are also
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the Closing of
the following conditions:

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and warranties
of the Company and EFIH set forth in this Agreement other than _Section_ __ _
5.1(b)_, _5.1(c)_ and _5.1(f)(i)_ , _5.1(w)_ (without giving effect to any
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth
therein) shall be true and correct on the date hereof and as of the Closing
as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall, subject to the
qualifications below, be true and correct as of such earlier date) except
where any failures of any such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and
warranties of the Company and EFIH set forth in (x) _ Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_
(other than _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)(ii))_ and _ Section_ __ _ 5.1(w)_ shall
be true and correct in all material respects on the date hereof and as of the
Closing and (y) _ Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_, and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(f)(i)_ shall be true and correct in all respects on the
date hereof and as of the Closing; and (iii) Parent shall have received at the
Closing a certificate signed on behalf of the Company and EFIH (in each case
by a senior executive officer of such entity) to the effect that such officer
has read this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and the conditions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ have been satisfied. The representations and
warranties of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in the Oncor Letter Agreement shall be
true and correct in all respects on the date hereof and as of the Closing as

applicable)_ being, the " _Termination Date_ "), _provided_ , _further_ ,
_that_ , the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (a)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation

restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting, directly
or indirectly, consummation of the Closing Date Transactions shall have become
final and non-appealable; _provided, however_ , that the termination right in

such representation or warranty were required by the Agreement to be true on
and as of each such date between the date hereof and the Closing Date, which
breach or failure of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be

the purpose of such clauses it shall be assumed such breach is continuing as
of the Closing) and (ii) cannot be, or has not been, cured within thirty (30)
Business Days after Parents receipt of written notice thereof from the
Company or EFIH; _provided_ , _however_ , that the termination right in this

of Reorganization;

(d) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if the Chapter 11 Cases are
dismissed or converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and
neither such dismissal or conversion contemplates the Closing Date
Transactions; _provided_ , that such dismissal or conversion was not proposed
or supported by the Company or EFIH (and which the Company and EFIH, to the
extent requested by Parent, used commercially reasonable efforts to challenge
before the Bankruptcy Court);

 

(e) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by the Company if
concurrently with such termination, the Company Board determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties,  _provided_ that a material breach of the Companys or EFIHs
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ has not provided the basis for such
determination; or

 

(f) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by EFIH if concurrently
with such termination, the board of managers of EFIH determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the

required by the Agreement to be true on and as of each such date between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach or failure of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or to be performed
(i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in any provision of

clauses it shall be assumed such breach is continuing as of the Closing), and

schedules hereto including as actually executed), the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June
7, 2016, by and among Parent, the Company and EFIH and, pursuant to a Joinder

agreements named herein constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and cancel, merge and supersede all
other prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUBS
NOR THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER
INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE
OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 



96 Section 9.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in  _Section_
__ _ 6.8_, Parent, the Merger Subs, EFIH and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section_ __ _ 6.8_
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.9 _Obligations of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent, including the Merger Subs, to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 9.10 _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed by the Company, EFIH, Parent or the Merger Subs in accordance with
the terms hereof and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. As a result, prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each party shall be entitled to
specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and of the terms
hereof (including the obligation to consummate the Closing Date Transactions
and the other transactions contemplated herein, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof), without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy) in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The
parties hereto further agree not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 

Section 9.11 _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent payable under applicable Law
(notwithstanding section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code), all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
Mergers shall be paid by the applicable Surviving Company when due.

 

Section 9.12 _Definitions_. Each term set forth in the Table of Defined Terms
is defined on the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 9.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other

 



97  provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.14 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a
section of or exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Such
exhibits are an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "made available" and words of similar import means that the relevant
documents, instruments or materials were either (i) posted and made available
to the other party or its designated Representatives on the Intralinks due
diligence data site maintained by the Company for purposes of the
transaction(s) contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) sent to the other party or
its representatives directly, or (iii) publicly available by virtue of the
relevant partys filing of a publicly available final registration statement,
prospectus, report, form, schedule or definitive proxy statement filed with
the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each case, at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the date hereof or such prior date with
respect to which such documents, instruments or materials were represented by
a party to have been made available to the other party. The words "shall" and
"will" have the same meaning; provided, that this sentence shall not apply to
the portions of _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)_,  _Section_
__ _ 7.3(c)_ and _Exhibit H_ describing the levels of comfort required with
respect to the various tax opinions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the first paragraphs of _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_ ,
respectively, each of the Company, EFIH, Parent and each of the Merger Subs
has, or may have, set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in
a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which
it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 



98 Section 9.15 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the non-assigning
parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

Re: Offer to Purchase LLC Units

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to (i) the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, dated as of November
5, 2008 (as amended, the " _Oncor LLC Agreement_ "), among Oncor Electric
Delivery Holdings Company LLC (" _Oncor Holdings_ "), Oncor Management
Investment LLC (" _Oncor Management_ ") and Texas Transmission Investment LLC
(" _TTI_ ") and (ii) the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of November 5,
2008 (the " _Investor Rights Agreement_ "), among Oncor Electric Delivery
Company LLC (" _Oncor_ "), Oncor Holdings, TTI and Energy Future Holdings
Corp. (" _EFH_ "). Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the
respective meanings set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement.

As you are aware, as of the date hereof, (1) an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger Agreement_ ") is being entered into by and among (i) EFH, (ii)
Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _EFIH_ "), (iii) Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, an Iowa
corporation (" _Parent_ "), (iv) O.E. Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _EFH Merger Sub_ "), (v) O.E. Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _EFIH Merger Sub_ ") and (vi) O.E. Merger Sub III, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Oncor Holdings Merger Sub_ " and,
together with EFH Merger Sub and EFIH Merger Sub, the " _Merger Subs_ "), a
copy of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto, and (2) EFH and certain
entities in which it, directly or indirectly, holds an equity interest
(collectively, the " _Debtors_ "), are filing a plan of reorganization under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and jointly
administered for procedural purposes only under Case No. 14-10979 (the " _Plan
of Reorganization_ ") that contemplates certain restructuring transactions
that include, among other things, (a) the merger of EFH Merger Sub with and
into reorganized EFH (the " _EFH Merger_ ") with reorganized EFH surviving as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _EFH Surviving Company_ "), (b) the
merger of reorganized EFIH with and into EFIH Merger Sub (the " _EFIH Merger_
") with EFIH Merger Sub surviving, and (c) the merger of Oncor Holdings with
and into Oncor Holdings Merger Sub (the " _Oncor Holdings Merger_ " and,  collectively with the EFH Merger and the EFIH Merger, the " _Mergers_ ")
with Oncor Holdings Merger Sub surviving. As a result of the Mergers, Oncor
Holdings Merger Sub will acquire all of the LLC Units currently held by Oncor
Holdings and, in turn, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of EFIH Merger Sub, which in turn will be a wholly owned subsidiary
of EFH Surviving Company. Parent will own all of the common stock of EFH
Surviving Company. The Plan of Reorganization, which is an integral element of
the Mergers, is an exhibit to and incorporated as part of the Merger
Agreement.

 

This letter constitutes an EFH Sale Proposal and represents an offer to
purchase (i) all of the LLC Units in Oncor held directly by Oncor Holdings
and held indirectly by EFIH and EFH, which transaction will be implemented
through the Mergers, and (ii) all of the LLC Units in Oncor that are owned by
members of Oncor other than Oncor Holdings. The amount of consideration
to consummate the Mergers (including the purchase of the LLC Units in Oncor
held directly by Oncor Holdings and held indirectly by EFIH and EFH in
connection therewith) is as set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization and is expected to be paid entirely in cash in accordance
therewith. The consummation of the transactions as contemplated by this EFH
Sale Proposal will result in a Change of Control.

 

Unless an agreement is otherwise entered into by and among Parent and one or
more of the members of Oncor other than Oncor Holdings (the " _Minority
Owners_ ") or the Minority Owners Affiliates on mutually agreeable terms and
conditions (a " _Mutually Agreed Definitive Agreement_ "), the form of the
purchase agreement (a " _Required Sale Purchase Agreement_ ") to be entered
into in order to provide for the purchase and sale of the LLC Units held by
the Minority Owners will be provided to TTI and Oncor Management prior to or
concurrently with the delivery by EFH of a Required Sale Notice as
contemplated by Section 3.3(a) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Such a
Required Sale Purchase Agreement will contain provisions that satisfy the
conditions of Section 3.3(d) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Among other
things, pursuant to the Required Sale Purchase Agreement, the form of
consideration to be paid to the Minority Owners will be cash, and the amount
of such consideration will be at least equal to the amount of the purchase
price for the LLC Units held by TTI that is required pursuant to Section 3.3
of the Investor Rights Agreement. Such purchase price in the Required Sale
Purchase Agreement will, among other things, be sufficient so that TTI will
achieve an IRR on its initial investment in the LLC Units which equals or
exceeds the IRR Hurdle. For the avoidance of doubt, a Mutually Agreed
Definitive Agreement may contain terms and conditions mutually agreed among
Parent and TTI and their Affiliates and such terms and conditions may not
satisfy the conditions of Section 3.3(d) of the Investor Rights Agreement.

The purchase of LLC Units pursuant to the Mergers in accordance with this
offer is a part of merger transactions that when consummated at the Closing,
will result in each of Parent, EFH Surviving Company, EFIH Merger Sub and
Oncor Holdings Merger Sub owning more of the equity interests in Oncor than
the relevant Related Entity or its Affiliates.

We are available at your earliest convenience to address any questions that
you may have about our offer. We look forward to working with you to complete
the purchase contemplated hereby.       |  |

2 ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.1 _Right to Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations and
conditions as provided in this Article IX, each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened,
pending or completed action or other proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, arbitrative or investigative, or any appeal in such
a proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a
proceeding (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she,
or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or while a director or officer of the
Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar
functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise shall be indemnified by the Corporation to
the fullest extent permitted by the TBOC, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended against judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes
and punitive damages), fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including,
without limitation, attorneys fees) actually incurred by such person in
connection with such proceeding, and indemnification under this Article IX
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which
initially entitled such person to indemnity hereunder. The rights granted
pursuant to this Article IX shall be deemed contract rights, and no
amendment, modification or repeal of this Article IX shall have the effect of
limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or
proceedings arising prior to any such amendment, modification or repeal. It
is expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this Article IX
could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict
liability.

 

Section 9.2 _Advancement of Expenses_. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Article IX shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the
Corporation the reasonable expenses incurred by a person of the type entitled
to be indemnified above who was, is or is threatened to be made a named
defendant or respondent in a proceeding in advance of the final disposition
of the proceeding and without any determination as to the persons ultimate
entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such
expenses incurred by any such person in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of a written
affirmation by such indemnified person of his or her good faith belief that he
or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under
this Article IX and a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
indemnified person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII
or if such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law.

Section 9.3 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Corporation, by
adoption of a resolution by the board of directors or a duly appointed
committee of the board of directors, may indemnify and advance expenses to an
employee or agent of the Corporation to the same extent and subject to the
same conditions under which it may indemnify and advance expenses to
directors and officers under this Article IX; and the Corporation, by adoption
of a resolution by the board of directors or a duly appointed

 



3  committee of the board of directors, may indemnify and advance expenses to
persons who are not or were not directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Corporation but who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, manager, member, partner, venturer, proprietor,
trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in such a
capacity or arising out of his or her status as such a person to the same
extent that it may indemnify and advance expenses to directors and officers
under this Article IX.

Section 9.4 _Appearance as a Witness_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Article IX, the Corporation may pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a
director, officer, employee, agent or other person in connection with his or
her appearance as a witness or other participation in a proceeding at a time
when he or she is not a named defendant or respondent in the proceeding.

Section 9.5  _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Article IX shall not be
exclusive of any other right which a director or officer or other person
indemnified pursuant to this Article IX may have or hereafter acquire under
any law (common or statutory), provision of this certificate of formation or
the bylaws of the Corporation, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

Section 9.6 _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase, procure, establish and
maintain, at its expense, insurance or another arrangement to indemnify or
hold harmless, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, manager, member,
partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary
of another foreign or domestic corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under this Article IX.

 

Section 9.7 _Savings Clause_. If this Article IX or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director,
officer or any other person indemnified pursuant to this Article IX as to
costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent
permitted by any applicable portion of this Article IX that shall not have
been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



4 For purposes of this Article IX, the term "Corporation" shall include any
predecessor of the Corporation and any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation
or merger; the term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or employee benefit
plan; service "at the request of the Corporation" shall include service as a
director, officer, manager, member or employee of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, manager,
member or employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants
or beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and
action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan which such person
reasonably believes to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation.

ARTICLE X

 

LIABILITY

No person shall be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary
damages for an act or omission by such person in such persons capacity as a
director; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not eliminate or
limit the liability of a director to the extent the director is found liable
under applicable law for: (i) any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its shareholders; (ii) any act or omission not in good
faith that constitutes a breach of duty of the director to the Corporation or
involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) any
transaction from which the director received an improper benefit, regardless
of whether the benefit resulted from an action taken within the scope of the
directors duties; or (iv) any act or omission for which a directors
liability is expressly provided by an applicable statute. If the Texas
Business Organizations Code or any other statute is amended or becomes
effective to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted
by such statute, as so amended or effective. Any repeal or modification of
the provisions of this Article X by the shareholders of the Corporation shall
not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE XI

2 ARTICLE I

 

Offices

SECTION 1.01  _Registered Office_. The registered office and registered agent
of Energy Future Holdings Corp. (the " _Corporation_ ") will be as from time
to time set forth in the Corporations Certificate of Formation, as amended
or restated (the " _Certificate of Formation_ "), or in any effective
certificate filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas to amend
such information.

 

SECTION 1.02 _Other Offices_. The Corporation may also have offices at such
other places both within and without the State of Texas as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation
may require.

ARTICLE II

 

Shareholders

SECTION 2.01 _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of the shareholders for the
election of directors will be held at such place, within or without the State
of Texas, as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Meetings of shareholders for any other purpose may be held at such time and
place, within or without the State of Texas, as may be stated in the notice of
the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

 

SECTION 2.02 _Meeting by Means of Remote Communication_. The Board of
Directors may, in its discretion, determine that a meeting of
the shareholders may be held solely by means of remote communication. If
authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to
any guidelines and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, shareholders
not physically present at a meeting of shareholders, by means of remote
communication:

(a) may participate in a meeting of shareholders; and

 

(b) may be considered present in person and may vote at a meeting of
shareholders held at a designated place or held solely by means of remote
communication; _provided_ that:

(i) the Corporation will implement reasonable measures to verify that each
person considered present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of
remote communication is a shareholder;

 

(ii) the Corporation will implement reasonable measures to provide the
shareholders at the meeting by means of remote communication a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of
the meeting substantially concurrently with the proceedings; and 

 



3 (iii) the Corporation will maintain a record of any shareholder vote or any
other action taken at the meeting by means of remote communication.

SECTION 2.03 _Annual Meeting_. An annual meeting of the shareholders will be
held at such time as may be determined by the Board of Directors, at which
meeting the shareholders will elect a Board of Directors, and transact such
other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

 

SECTION 2.04 _List of Shareholders_. At least eleven (11) days before each
meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, along with each shareholders
address, the type and number of shares held by each shareholder, and the
number of votes to which each shareholder is entitled (if different from the
number of shares), will be prepared by the officer or agent having charge of
the stock transfer books. Such list will be open to the examination of any
shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary
business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting,
either at the registered office or the principal executive office of the
Corporation. Alternatively, the list of shareholders may be kept on a
reasonably accessible electronic network if the information required to gain
access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list will
also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof, and will be subject to the inspection of any shareholder
who may be present. If the meeting is held by means of remote communication,
the list will be open to the examination of any shareholder for the duration
of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access the list will be provided to shareholders with
the notice of the meeting. The original stock transfer books will be prima
facie evidence of who is entitled to examine the list or transfer book or to
vote at any such meeting of shareholders.

SECTION 2.05 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called, unless otherwise prescribed by law, as set forth in the Certificate
of Formation.

 



4 SECTION 2.06 _Notice of Shareholders  Meetings_. Written or printed notice
stating the place, day and hour of any meeting of the shareholders, the means
of any remote communications by which shareholders may be considered present
and may vote at the meeting, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, will be delivered not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting (unless
otherwise provided by law), either personally, by electronic transmission if
permitted by the shareholder as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, or by
mail, by or at the direction of the President, the Secretary, or the person or
persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at
the meeting.

 

SECTION 2.07 _Quorum_. At all meetings of the shareholders, the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote will be necessary and sufficient to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate of Formation or these Bylaws. If, however,
such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the shareholders,
the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, will have power to adjourn the meeting until such time and to such
place, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, by a vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at
that meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. If the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date
is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will be
given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is represented, any business may be
transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified.

SECTION 2.08 _Voting_. When a quorum is present at any meeting of the
shareholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote on, and who voted for, against, or expressly abstained with respect to
any matter will decide any questions brought before such meeting, unless the
question is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of
Formation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such
express provision will govern and control the decision of such question.
The shareholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting
may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

 

SECTION 2.09 _Method of Voting_. Each outstanding share of the Corporations
capital stock will be entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to a
vote at a meeting of shareholders, except to the extent that the Certificate
of Formation provides for more or less than one (1) vote per share, or limits
or denies voting rights to the holders of the shares of any class or series.
At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote
will be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy executed in writing subscribed
by such shareholder and bearing a date not more than eleven (11) months prior
to such meeting, unless such instrument provides for a longer period. A
telegram, telex, cablegram, or other form of electronic transmission by the
shareholder, including telephonic transmission, or a
photographic, photostatic, facsimile, or similar reproduction of a writing
executed by the shareholder will be treated as an execution in writing. Any
electronic transmission must contain or be accompanied

 



5  by information from which it can be determined that the transmission was
authorized by the shareholder. Each proxy will be revocable unless expressly
provided therein to be irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. Such proxy
will be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation prior to or at the time of
the meeting. Voting on any question, including the election of directors, may
be by voice vote or show of hands unless the presiding officer orders, or any
shareholder demands, that voting be by written ballot.

 

SECTION 2.10 _Record Date_. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a record
date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of shareholders, which record date will not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date will not be less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days prior to such meeting. In the absence of any action by the
Board of Directors, the date on which the notice is given will be the record
date.

 

SECTION 2.11 _Action by Consent_.

 

A. _Consent Allowed_. Any action required or permitted by law, the Certificate
of Formation or these Bylaws to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of
the Corporation may be taken without a meeting if a consent or consents in
writing, stating the action so taken, is signed by the holder or holders of
outstanding shares having at least the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which the holders of all
shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted.

B.  _Dated Signature; Limited Time; Delivery_. Every written consent of the
shareholders must bear the date of signature. No written consent will be
effective to take the action that is the subject of the consent unless, within
sixty (60) days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the
Corporation, a consent signed by the holders of shares having at least the
minimum number of votes necessary to take the action that is the subject of
the consent is delivered to the Corporation. If the consent is solicited on
behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors, delivery must be made by
hand or by regular, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or
by such other means set forth in the solicitation, and will be delivered to
the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Texas,
its principal place of business, or to the Secretary. If the consent is not
solicited on behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors, delivery
must be made by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, and will be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Texas, its principal place of business, or
to the Secretary. A consent delivered to the Corporations principal place of
business must be addressed to the President, or to the Board of Directors if
there is no President.

 

C. _Writings_. Any photographic, photostatic, facsimile or similarly reliable
reproduction of a consent in writing signed by a shareholder may be
substituted or used instead of the original writing for any purpose for which
the original writing could be used, if the reproduction is a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing.

 



6 D. _Notice of Consent_. Prompt notice of any action taken by shareholders
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent must be given to
those shareholders who did not consent in writing to the action, but advance
notice is not required. Delay or failure to provide such notice shall not
affect the validity of such authorization. 

ARTICLE III

Board of Directors

SECTION 3.01 _Management_. The Board of Directors shall exercise or authorize
the exercise of the powers of the Corporation and direct the management of
the business and affairs of the Corporation. In such connection, the Board of
Directors shall do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the
Certificate of Formation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be
exercised or done by the shareholders.

SECTION 3.02 _Qualification; Election; Term of Office_. None of the directors
need be a shareholder of the Corporation or a resident of the State of Texas.
The directors will be elected by plurality vote at a meeting of the
shareholders, except as provided in the Certificate of Formation or these
Bylaws. Each director elected will hold office until whichever of the
following occurs first: such directors successor is elected and qualified,
such directors resignation, such directors removal from office by the
shareholders or such directors death.

SECTION 3.03 _Number_. The number of directors of the Corporation will be at
least one (1). The number of directors will be set as the Board of Directors
may from time to time designate, or if no such designation has been made, the
number of directors will be the same as the number of members of the initial
Board of Directors as set forth in the Certificate of Formation. No decrease
in the number of directors will shorten the term of any incumbent director.

SECTION 3.04  _Resignation_. Any director may resign at any time upon notice
to the President or Secretary given in writing or by electronic transmission.
The resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, and if no
time is specified, at the time of its receipt by the President or the

SECTION 3.05 _Removal_. Any director may be removed for or without cause at
any special meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of

calling such meeting.

 



7 SECTION 3.06 _Vacancy_. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by an affirmative vote
of at least a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum
of the Board of Directors, or by the shareholders acting by consent or at any
meeting of shareholders of the Corporation. A director elected to fill a
vacancy will be elected for the unexpired term of such directors predecessor
in office. A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number
of directors may be filled for a term of office only until the next election
of one or more directors by the shareholders.

then elected and serving change the time or place by unanimous consent.

may be held without notice at such time and place as is from time to time
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. Except as may be otherwise

neither the business to be transacted nor the purpose of any regular meeting
need be specified in a notice or waiver of notice.

SECTION 3.10 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by the President upon oral or written notice or, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_, notice by electronic transmission to each director,
given at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the meeting either
personally, by mail or by electronic transmission; special meetings will be
called by the President or Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the
written request of at least two (2) directors. Except as may be otherwise
expressly provided by law, the Certificate of Formation or these Bylaws,
neither the business to be transacted nor the purpose of any special meeting
need be specified in a notice or waiver of notice.

 

SECTION 3.11 _Quorum_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors the presence
of a majority of the number of directors set or established in the manner
provided by these Bylaws will be necessary and sufficient to constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business, and the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present
will be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Formation or these Bylaws. If
a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.

 



8 SECTION 3.12 _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers or between the
Corporation and any other entity in which one or more of the Corporations
directors or officers is a managerial official or has a financial interest
will be void or voidable: (a) for this reason; (b) because the director or
officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors
or committee that authorizes the contract or transaction; or (c) because such
person votes to authorize the contract or transaction if: (i) the material
facts as to such persons relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed to or are known by the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
disinterested directors or committee members, even though the disinterested
directors or committee members are less than a quorum; (ii) the
material facts as to such persons relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed to or are known by the shareholders
entitled to vote on the authorizations thereof, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
shareholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the
Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the shareholders. Common
or interested directors may be included in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee that
authorizes the contract or transaction.

 

SECTION 3.13 _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate from among its
members one or more committees, each of which committee will be comprised of
one (1) or more of its members, and may designate one (1) or more of its
members as alternate members of any committee, who may, subject to any
limitations imposed by the Board of Directors, replace absent or disqualified
members at any meeting of such committee. Any such committee, to the extent
provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, the Certificate of
Formation or these Bylaws, will have and may exercise all of the authority of
the Board of Directors, subject to the limitations set forth in the Texas
Business Organizations Code. Such committee or committees will have such name
or names as may be designated by the Board of Directors and will keep regular
minutes of their proceedings and report their proceedings to the Board of
Directors when requested or required by the Board of Directors. The
designation of any committee of the board of directors and the delegation
thereto of authority will not operate to relieve the board of directors or
any member thereof of any responsibility imposed on the board or the member by
law. The number of members on each committee may be changed by resolution of
the Board of Directors. Any member of any committee may be removed from
that committee at any time by resolution of the Board of Directors, if the
Board determines that the removal is in the best interests of the Corporation.
Vacancies in the membership of a committee (whether by death, resignation,
removal, or any other manner) may be filled by resolution of the Board of
Directors. The time, place, and notice of any meetings of any committee will
be determined by that committee. At meetings of any committee, a majority of
the members of that committee constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business, and the act of a majority of the members present at any meeting at
which a quorum is present will be the act of the committee, except as
otherwise specifically provided by statute, the Certificate of Formation, or
these Bylaws. If a quorum is not present at a meeting of any committee, the
members present may adjourn the meeting without notice (other than an
announcement at the meeting) until a quorum is present.

 



9 SECTION 3.14 _Remote Meetings_. Directors and committee members may
participate in and hold meetings by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can
hear each other. Participation in such a meeting will constitute presence in
person at the meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been
lawfully called or convened.

 

SECTION 3.15 _Action Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided by the
Certificate of Formation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any
meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee,
as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, signed by all the members of the Board of Directors or such committee,
as the case may be, and the writing or writings are filed in the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors. A telegram, telex, cablegram, or other
electronic transmission by a director consenting to an action to be taken and
transmitted by a director is considered written, signed, and dated for the
purposes of this section if the transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the transmission
was transmitted by the director and the date on which the director transmitted
the transmission.

SECTION 3.16 _Compensation of Directors_. Directors may receive such
compensation for their services and reimbursement for their expenses as the
Board of Directors, by resolution, may establish; _provided_ that nothing
herein contained will be construed to preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Vice President designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such
designation the Vice Presidents in the order of their seniority in
office, will exercise the powers and perform the duties of the President.

SECTION 4.13 _Secretary_. The Secretary will attend all meetings of the
shareholders and record all votes and the minutes of all proceedings in a book
to be kept for that purpose. The Secretary will perform like duties for the

special meetings of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in

Board of Directors or any committee thereof, if so authorized by the Board of
Directors (subject to any employment agreements that may then be in effect

officers or agents shall be prevented from receiving such compensation by
reason of the fact that such person is also a director. Nothing contained

books and ledgers, such notice to include proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer by such holder. A record of the
transaction upon the books of the Corporation shall be made of each transfer.
Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not

transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so. The Board
of Directors shall have power and authority to make such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer

14 ARTICLE VI

 

Notice; Waiver of Notice

 

SECTION 6.01 _Notice_. Whenever required by law, the Certificate of Formation
or these Bylaws, notice is to be given to any shareholder, director or
committee member, such notice may be given in writing addressed to such person
at such address as appears on the records of the Corporation. If given by
mail, any notice will be deemed given at the time the same is deposited in
the United States mail. With consent of a shareholder, director or committee
member, notice from the Corporation may be given to that person by electronic
transmission. The shareholder, director, or committee person may specify the
form of electronic transmission to be used to communicate notice. The
shareholder, director or committee member may revoke this consent by written
notice to the Corporation. The consent is deemed to be revoked if the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2)
consecutive notices and the person responsible for delivering notice on behalf
of the Corporation knows that delivery of these two (2) electronic
transmissions was unsuccessful; _provided_ , however, that the inadvertent
failure to treat the unsuccessful transmissions as a revocation of consent
does not invalidate a meeting or other action. Notice by electronic
transmission is deemed given when the notice is: (a) transmitted to a
facsimile number provided by the shareholder, director or committee member
for the purpose of receiving notice; (b) transmitted to an electronic mail
address provided by the shareholder, director or committee member for the
purpose of receiving notice; (c) posted on an electronic network, and a
message is sent to the shareholder, director or committee member at the
address provided by that person for the purpose of alerting the that person of
a posting; or (d) communicated to the shareholder, director or committee
member by any other form of electronic transmission consented to by the that
person.

SECTION 6.02  _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given
to any shareholder, director or committee member of the Corporation as
required by law, the Certificate of Formation or these Bylaws, a written
waiver of any notice, signed by a shareholder, director or committee member,
or waiver by electronic transmission by such person, whether given before or
after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed
equivalent to the notice required to be given to such person. Neither the
business nor the purpose of any meeting need by specified in such waiver.
Attendance of a shareholder, director, or committee member at a meeting will
constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except when the shareholder,
director, or committee member attends for the express purpose of objecting, at
the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground
that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

Indemnification

SECTION 7.01 _Right to Indemnification for Directors and Officers_. The
Corporation will indemnify its existing and former directors and officers to
the fullest extent permitted by the Texas Business Organizations Code, as the
same exists or may be hereafter be amended, and may, if and to the extent
authorized by the Board of Directors, so indemnify any other person whom it
has the power under the Texas Business Organizations Code to indemnify against
any liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever.

 



15 SECTION 7.02 _Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to any right to
indemnification conferred in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ of these Bylaws, the
Corporation will advance reasonable expenses incurred by any of its existing
and former directors and officers who was, is, or is threatened to be made a
responding in a proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the
proceeding; _provided_ that the existing or former director or officer
provides the Corporation with a written affirmation of such persons good
faith belief that such person has met the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification under the Texas Business Organizations Code, and a written
undertaking by such person or on such persons behalf to repay the amount paid
or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such person has not met
such standard or if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such
person against expenses incurred by such person in such connection is
prohibited by the Texas Business Organizations Code, except to the extent
a court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by such director or
officer, determines that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
payment or reimbursement of expenses in view of all the relevant
circumstances, whether or not such person has met such standard, and orders
such payment or reimbursement as it determines is proper and equitable. The
indemnification ordered by a court is limited to reasonable expenses if the
existing or former director or officer is found liable to the enterprise or
because the person improperly received a personal benefit, without regard to
whether the benefit resulted from an action taken in the persons official
capacity.

 

SECTION 7.03 _Reporting of Advancement of Expenses_. The Corporation will
report in writing to the shareholders an indemnification of or advance of
expenses to a governing person. Such report will be made with or before the
notice or waiver of notice of the next meeting of the shareholders or before
the next submission to the shareholders of a consent to action without a
meeting, but in any case not later than the first anniversary of the date of
the indemnification or advance.

SECTION 7.04 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of existing and former directors and officers of the
Corporation.

 

SECTION 7.05 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section
7.01 or 7.02 of these Bylaws is not paid in full by the Corporation within
sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,
except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by the

 



16  Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (b) any suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the Texas Business Organizations Code.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not
parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal
counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that identification of the indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Texas Business Organizations Code, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its shareholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

SECTION 7.06 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, the Certificate of Formation, these Bylaws, any
agreement, any vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

SECTION 7.07 _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of the Corporation to indemnify or hold harmless an existing or
former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or who is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, employee benefit
plan, other enterprise, or other entity, against any liability asserted
against and incurred by such person in such a capacity or arising out of such
persons status as such a person, whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the Texas
Business Organizations Code.

SECTION 7.08 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in
this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or similar functionary
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and
administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that
adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or such persons heirs, executors
and administrators shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate
any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
such amendment, alteration or repeal.

 



17 SECTION 7.09 _Settlement of Claims_. The Corporation shall not be liable to
indemnify any indemnitee under this Article VII for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the Corporations written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any judicial
award if the Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity,
at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.

SECTION 7.10  _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this Article VII,
the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of
the rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

Key Regulatory Terms

Parent commits that:

_BOARD_



     | 1. | _Separate Board Commitment_. At closing and thereafter,
Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC ("Oncor") will have a separate board of
directors that will not include any employees of Berkshire Hathaway Energy
Company ("BHE") competitive affiliates in Texas, any members from the boards
of directors of BHEs competitive affiliates in Texas, or any individuals
other than the Chairman of the Board of BHE with direct responsibility
for the management or strategies of the competitive affiliates. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | _Independent Board Commitment_. Each of Oncor and Oncor
Electric Delivery Holdings Company LLC ("Oncor Holdings") will have a board of
directors comprised of at least ten (10) directors. A majority of the Oncor
Holdings board members and Oncors board members will qualify as
"independent" in all material respects in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (which are set forth in
Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual), from BHE and its subsidiaries
(including BHEs affiliated retail electric provider ("REP") and generation
company). Oncor Holdings and Oncors boards of directors will not include

boards of directors of BHEs competitive affiliates in Texas. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | a. | The Oncor Board shall have six (6) Independent/Disinterested
Directors, two (2) directors who will be officers of Oncor, and two (2)
directors who will be designated by BHE.

---|---|--- 



     | c. | The duties of the Board members of Oncor Holdings and Oncor
will be to act in the best interests of Oncor consistent with the approved
ring-fence and Delaware Law. 
---|---|--- Oncors Boards cannot be overruled by the board of BHE or any of its
subsidiaries on dividend policy, debt issuance, capital
expenditures, management and service fees, and appointment or removal of
board members, provided that such actions may also require the additional
approval of Oncor Holdings Board. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | a. | The appointment or removal of the Chief Executive Officer or
the Chief Financial Officer of Oncor shall require a majority vote of Oncor
board of directors, which vote must include the unanimous vote of the
BHE directors. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Neither Oncor Holdings nor Oncor nor any of their
subsidiaries may without the prior written consent of BHE: (1) enter into or

filing. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Only the Oncor Holdings Nominating Committee can replace or
remove any of the Independent/Disinterested Directors on the Oncor or Oncor

be subject to the approval by a majority vote of Independent/Disinterested
Directors.

to approve any amendments or changes to the key provisions of LLC Agreements
relating to: (1) the Independent Board; (2) the rights and powers
of Independent/Disinterested Directors; (3) removal of Directors; and (4)
Delaware as controlling law. Changes to the key provisions of the LLC

     | 9. | _Cross-Default Provisions, Financial Covenants or Rating
Agency Triggers_. Oncor will not include in any of its debt or credit
agreements cross-default provisions between Oncors securities and the

---|---|--- 



     | 16. | _Credit Rating Registration Commitment_. BHE and Oncor will
be registered with major nationally and internationally recognized bond rating

a bankruptcy of BHE or any affiliate of BHE, a bankruptcy court would not
consolidate the assets and liabilities of Oncor with BHE or any affiliate of
BHE. 
---|---|--- _CAPEX_



     | 19. | _Capital Expenditure Commitment_. Oncor shall make minimum

interruption frequency index ("SAIFI") standards should be calculated for

its Quarterly Performance Reports and yearly Service Quality Reports
filed pursuant to 16 Tex. Admin Code ("TAC") §25.81. 
---|---|--- 



     | 34. | _Transaction Costs._ None of the transaction costs will be
borne by Oncors customers, nor will Oncor seek to include transaction costs
in rates. For purposes of this commitment, "Transaction Costs" are those
incremental costs paid to advance or consummate the Proposed Transaction.
Examples of Transaction Costs include, but are not limited to: BHE employee

     | 36. |

_Workforce._ For two years after closing, each current Oncor employee who is
employed on the closing date will be provided; (a) a base salary or wage rate
no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such employee
immediately prior to the closing date; (b) aggregate incentive compensation
opportunities that are substantially  

---|---|--- employee immediately prior to the closing date; and (c) employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
employee immediately prior to the closing date. Oncor will not implement any
material involuntary workforce reductions (with respect to either field or
corporate personnel) of Oncor employees. 
---|--- 
 



     | 37. | _Collective Bargaining Agreements._ With respect to any
Oncor employee whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of such employment
will continue to be governed by the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining agreement, as may be modified from time to time. 
---|---|--- 



     | 38. | _Code of Conduct._ Oncor will continue to conduct its
activities in compliance with its existing code of conduct. 
---|---|--- 



     | 39. | _Commission Jurisdiction_. Oncor and Oncor Holdings will
not own, operate, or construct capital assets outside of ERCOT without prior
approval from the Commission or take any other action that would impair
the Commissions regulatory jurisdiction. Neither Oncor, Oncor Holdings, BHE
nor their respective affiliates will take any action that would subject ERCOT
assets to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC"); provided, however, that FERC continues to have jurisdiction under
sections 210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act ("FPA") and may direct
transmission and interconnection services over certain existing facilities
outside of ERCOT; provided further that the existing reliability and critical
infrastructure standards administered by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation ("NERC"), through delegation of authority from FERC,
may affect the operations of assets that are deemed part of the bulk electric
system. 
---|---|--- 



     | 40. | _Texas Reliability Entity_. Oncor will not seek to have
another NERC Regional Entity other than the Texas Reliability Entity serve as
the lead regional entity responsible for monitoring Oncors activities
and ensuring compliance with NERC Reliability Standards. 
---|---|--- 



     | 41. | _Goodwill_. Any costs of goodwill of BHE or its affiliates
(including the pre-existing goodwill recognized by Oncor) will not be included
in rate base, cost of capital, or operating expenses in future Oncor
ratemaking proceedings. Write-downs or write-offs of goodwill will not be
included in the calculation of net income for dividend payment purposes. 
---|---|--- pushdown accounting for the merger, i.e., the merger will have no impact on
Oncors assets being acquired; and any incremental goodwill will not be
allocated to, or recognized within, Oncors balance sheet. 
---|---|--- 



     | 43. | _Tangible and Quantifiable Benefits_. At a minimum, Oncor
will provide the following tangible and quantifiable benefits associated with
the merger. Oncor will provide monthly bill credits to electric delivery
rates for ultimate credits to customers in an amount equal to 90% of any
interest rate savings achieved until: final rates are set in the next Oncor
base rate case after the Oncor base rate case currently filed. Savings will
not be included in credits if already realized in rates. Interest Rate
Savings refers to the improvement in Oncors borrowing costs post-close
relative to those costs as of June 30, 2017 due to improvement in credit
ratings and/or improvement in market spreads. Until final rates are set in
the next Oncor base rate case after the Oncor base rate case that is currently
filed, Oncor will file a report with the Commission every six months detailing
any interest rate savings determined by the amount of debt issued by Oncor by
at least 0.15% (amounts above 0.15% being based on actual interest rate
savings by Oncor) and demonstrating a calculation of the credit. BHE and Oncor
agree to work in good faith with interested parties to determine an acceptable
method for implementation of any bill credit to effectuate this commitment,
as approved by the Commission. At a minimum, Oncor shall provide retail
electric providers 45-day notice of the amount of any customer credits (e.g.,
for each customer class, the amount per kwh or per-customer credit that would
apply) prior to the effective date of the credits and shall implement updated
bill credits simultaneously with other changes in Oncors rates. In addition,
one year after closing, Oncor will present a merger synergy savings analysis
to the Commission and provide monthly bill credits to electric rates for
inclusion in customer bills in an amount equal to 90% of any synergy savings
until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate proceeding, in which any
total synergy savings shall be reflected in Oncors rates. 
---|---|--- Agreements shall be amended to the extent necessary to effect all of the
commitments herein.
