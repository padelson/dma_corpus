all of the LLC Units currently held by Oncor Holdings and, in turn, Oncor Holdings Merger Sub will be a wholly owned subsidiary of EFIH Merger Sub, which in turn will be a wholly owned subsidiary of EFH Surviving Company. Parent will own all of the
common stock of EFH Surviving Company. The Plan of Reorganization, which is an integral element of the Mergers, is an exhibit to and incorporated as part of the Merger Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This letter constitutes an EFH Sale Proposal and represents an offer to purchase (i)&nbsp;all of the LLC Units in Oncor held directly by Oncor
Holdings and held indirectly by EFIH and EFH, which transaction will be implemented through the Mergers, and (ii)&nbsp;all of the LLC Units in Oncor that are owned by members of Oncor other than Oncor Holdings. The amount of consideration to
consummate the Mergers (including the purchase of the LLC Units in Oncor held directly by Oncor Holdings and held indirectly by EFIH and EFH in connection therewith) is as set forth in the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Reorganization and is
expected to be paid entirely in cash in accordance therewith. The consummation of the transactions as contemplated by this EFH Sale Proposal will result in a Change of Control. </P>

Notice as contemplated by Section&nbsp;3.3(a) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Such a Required Sale Purchase Agreement will contain provisions that satisfy the conditions of Section&nbsp;3.3(d) of the Investor Rights Agreement. Among other things,
pursuant to the Required Sale Purchase Agreement, the form of consideration to be paid to the Minority Owners will be cash, and the amount of such consideration will be at least equal to the amount of the purchase price for the LLC Units held by TTI
that is required pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.3 of the Investor Rights Agreement. Such purchase price in the Required Sale Purchase Agreement will, among other things, be sufficient so that TTI will achieve an IRR on its initial investment in the LLC
Units which equals or exceeds the IRR Hurdle. For the avoidance of doubt, a Mutually Agreed Definitive Agreement may contain terms and conditions mutually agreed among Parent and TTI and their Affiliates and such terms and conditions may not satisfy
the conditions of Section&nbsp;3.3(d) of the Investor Rights Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase of LLC Units pursuant to the Mergers in accordance

Related Entity or its Affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are available at your earliest convenience to address any questions that you may have about our

final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case after the Oncor base rate case that is currently filed, Oncor will file a report with the Commission every six months detailing any interest rate savings determined by the amount of debt issued by
Oncor by at least 0.15% (amounts above 0.15% being based on actual interest rate savings by Oncor) and demonstrating a calculation of the credit. BHE and Oncor agree to work in good faith with interested parties to determine an acceptable method for

synergy savings until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate proceeding, in which any total synergy savings shall be reflected in Oncor&#146;s rates. </TD></TR></TABLE>
