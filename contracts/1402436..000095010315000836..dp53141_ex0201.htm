ARTICLE 2

  

The Merger

  

  

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk
and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions; provided, however, that if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the date following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of such conditions that is
the earliest to occur of (A) a date during the Marketing Period to be
specified by Parent and (B) the final day of the Marketing Period, or (ii) at
such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger

  

Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
(the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the
certificate of merger).

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  

  

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each
share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive $44.25 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

  

  

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other
than shares in a trust or managed account under an Employee Plan of the
Company) or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent
shall make available to the Paying Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (any
funds deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Payment Fund"). Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to
each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent)
for use in such exchange.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.03 that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares
of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years
after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.03 to pay for shares of Company Stock for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund as directed by
Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent. In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to make
the payments contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause
Merger Subsidiary to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent
in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make
such payment.

  

  

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to all such demands. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  

  

Section 2.05. Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each vested Company
Stock Option (including those Company Stock Options listed on Section 2.05(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule that vest as of the Effective Time) that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Vested
Option") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall become a right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested
Option, by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of the Vested Option (with the aggregate
payment rounded down to the nearest cent), less applicable Tax withholding.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (an
"Unvested Option"), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted Stock
Option") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted
Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Option divided
by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted Stock Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
converted Unvested Option under the Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder, including as to vesting.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in all cases, the
exercise price of, and the number of shares subject to, each Adjusted Stock
Option shall be determined as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the
Code, and for any Unvested Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code,
the option price, the number of shares subject to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to
comply with Section 424 of the Code.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each vested Company SAR (including those Company
SARs listed on Section 2.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that vest as
of the Effective Time) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a "Vested SAR"), shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested SAR, by (y) the excess, if any,
of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
the Vested SAR (with the aggregate payment rounded down to the nearest cent),
less applicable Tax withholding.

  

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company SAR (an "Unvested SAR") that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent a right to receive shares of Company Stock or cash
and shall be converted automatically into a stock appreciation right in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted SAR") equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Unvested SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted SAR shall have an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (i) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Company Stock subject to such Unvested SAR divided by (ii) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted SAR shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions applicable to the converted Unvested SAR under the Equity Plan
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including as to vesting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in all cases, the
exercise price of, and the number of shares subject to, each Adjusted SAR
shall be determined as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect of shares of
Company Stock granted under the Equity Plan (a "Company RSU") that (i) is
listed on Section 2.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) will vest as of
the Effective Time (a "Vested RSU"), shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested RSU, by (y) the amount of the
Merger Consideration, less applicable Tax withholding. Any Dividend Equivalent
Rights

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

applicable to any such Vested RSU shall vest and be paid to the holder of such
Vested RSU in accordance with its terms. With respect to each award of
Performance RSUs listed on Section 2.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
a number of shares of Company Stock subject to such award will become vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time based on the applicable level of
performance as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board
of Directors pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan and the applicable
Performance RSU award agreement in the form previously provided to Parent, and
such number of shares of Company Stock shall be settled by the Company in cash
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Plan and the applicable Performance RSU
award agreement. The remaining unvested shares of Company Stock subject to
such Performance RSU award will convert in accordance with Section 2.05(f) and
such shares will thereafter vest monthly based on continued service over the
portion of the performance period after the Effective Time, as determined
under and subject to the terms of the Equity Plan and the applicable
Performance RSU award agreement.

  

  

(f) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU (an "Unvested RSU") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right with respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be
converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted RSU") equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company
Stock subject to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Company
RSU under the Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder,
including as to vesting and, if applicable, the right of the holder thereof to
receive Dividend Equivalent Rights (which such Dividend Equivalent Rights will
be allocated on a pro rata basis to the applicable shares of Parent Common
Stock, rounded down to the nearest cent).

  

  

(g) Any payment to which a current or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company becomes entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(a),
Section 2.05(c) or Section 2.05(e) shall be made through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.
Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent the amounts to be paid under
Section 2.05(a), Section 2.05(c) or Section 2.05(e) to holders of Vested
Options, Vested SARs or Vested RSUs who are not current or former employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company's Board of Directors and its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take all actions that are
reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.05 and
Parent, the Parent's Board of Directors and its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the
assumption by Parent of the Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted SARs and Adjusted
RSUs.

Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange of shares or any
similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period (but, in each case, expressly excluding (i) any change resulting
from the grant of any Company Stock Options, Company SARS or Company RSUs
expressly permitted by this Agreement, and (ii) any change that results from
any exercise or settlement of Company Stock Options, Company SARs or Company
RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof or granted after the date hereof in
compliance with this Agreement to purchase shares of Company Stock granted
under the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.07. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  

  

Section 2.08. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this Article 2.

other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any
Material Contract or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other Contract

Section 4.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) The Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC, and made available to Parent to the extent
not publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR filing system, all reports,

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company SEC Document filed

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and

controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in the Company's periodic and
current reports required under the 1934 Act. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the

assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and
the preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Company's
auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Company's
auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2012.

the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and NASDAQ, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct.

  

  

(j) There are no off-balance sheet arrangements of any type pursuant to any
off-balance sheet arrangement required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act that have not
been so described in the Company SEC Documents.

  

  

(k) Since January 1, 2012, there has been no transaction, or series of similar
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor is there any
proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or series of similar
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that would be required to
be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the 1933 Act.

  

  

Section 4.08. Financial Statements. (a) The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents
fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-
end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

  

  

(b) The earnings release of the Company included in Section 4.08 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the
consolidated results of their operations, their consolidated cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity for the period then ended (subject to any
adjustments described therein). Such earnings release was prepared in good
faith based upon assumptions that are reasonable as of the date hereof.

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act. At the
time the Company Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto are
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time such
stockholders vote on approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Company
Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.09
will not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by
reference in the Company Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective representatives or
advisors specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

(b) From the Company Balance Sheet Date until the date hereof, (i) the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices and (ii) there has not been any
action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken during
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time without
Parent's consent, would constitute a breach of Section 6.01 (other than
subsection (j) (Material Contracts)).

  

  

Section 4.11. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
other than: (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the
Company Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto; (ii) liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
since the Company Balance Sheet Date, (iii) liabilities and other obligations
under executory Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party (other than any liability or other obligation arising from a breach of
such Contract by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (iv) contractual
liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (v) liabilities or obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 4.12. Compliance with Laws and Court Orders. (a) The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is and since January 1, 2011 has been in compliance with,
and to the knowledge of the Company is not under investigation with respect to
and has not been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any
violation of, any Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner seeks to prevent,
enjoin, alter or materially delay the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries
hold all governmental licenses, franchises, authorizations, permits, consents,
approvals, variances, exemptions and orders necessary for the operation of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company Permits"). Except
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, and since January 1, 2011,
there has occurred no violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) under, or event giving to others any right of termination or
cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any Company
Permit. Since January 1, 2011, no event has occurred that (i) gives to any
Person any right of revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse
modification (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) of any Company
Permit or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, would otherwise reasonably be
expected to result in the termination, cancellation, revocation, adverse
modification or non-renewal of any Company Permit, which in the case of clause
(i) and (ii), would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably

and all amendments thereto and, as applicable, (ii) all trust agreements,

or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability under ERISA or the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (nor any predecessor
of any such entity) sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to (or has
any obligation to contribute to), or has in the past six years sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to (or had any obligation to

incurred by such Service Provider, including under Section 409A, 457A or 4999
of the Code.

  

  

(e) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code may rely on a prototype opinion letter or has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, and no circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such determination letter being
revoked or not being reissued or a penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement
Program if discovered during an IRS audit or investigation. Each trust created
under any such Employee Plan is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code and has been so exempt since its creation. Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements of
Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except for failures to comply or
violations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions, premiums and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with any
other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any
payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or
job security payment or benefit, (ii) enhance any benefits or accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase the
amount payable or trigger any other obligation under, any Employee Plan or
otherwise or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after Closing, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any
Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or
otherwise) covering any current or former Service Provider that, individually
or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible due to the application of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability for, and no Employee Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability, hospitalization,
life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or
former Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law,
including the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (or
COBRA)).

  

  

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (or
any basis therefore) (other than routine claims for benefits) pending against
or involving, or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against or involving
any Employee Plan before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority,
including the IRS or the Department of Labor that, if determined or resolved
adversely in accordance with the plaintiff's demands, would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been since January 1,
2012, in compliance with all Applicable Laws with respect to labor relations,
employment and employment practices, including those relating to labor
management relations, wages, hours, overtime, employee classification,
discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights, affirmative action, work
authorization, immigration, safety and health, information privacy and
security, workers compensation, continuation coverage under group health
plans, wage payment and the payment and withholding of Taxes, except for
failures to comply or violations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(j) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in compliance with its
terms and Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) if intended to qualify
for special tax treatment, meets in all material respects all the requirements
for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be funded, book-
reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or
secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on reasonable actuarial
assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting principles.

  

  

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been party to or
subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
Collective Bargaining Agreement. There has not been any organizational
campaign, petition or other unionization activity seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit relating to any Service Provider. There are no, and
since January 1, 2012 there have not been any, labor strikes, slowdowns,
stoppages, picketings, interruptions of work or lockouts pending or, to the
Company's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its

or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board or any other
Governmental Authority or any current union representation questions involving
Service Providers. The consent or consultation of, or the rendering of formal
advice by, any labor or trade union, works council or other employee
representative body is not required for the Company to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

and Merger Subsidiary have relied on the results of their own

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

independent investigation and representations and warranties set forth in this

ARTICLE 5

  

Representations and Warranties of Parent

  

  

Subject to Section 11.05, except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, Parent represents and warrants to the Company that:

  

  

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of its
incorporation, Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities other than
in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with
arranging any financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the corporate powers of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, except for
the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance
with its terms (subject to the Enforceability Limitations).

  

  

Section 5.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect
to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to
do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and the Antitrust Laws of the Foreign Antitrust Jurisdictions, (iii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and
any other state or federal securities laws and (iv) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.03, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any Contract binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit,
certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in
any way to, the assets or business of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses
(ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.05. Disclosure Documents. The information supplied in writing by
Parent for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement will not, at the time the
Company Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Approval, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties in this Section
5.05 will not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by
reference in the Company Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by
the Company or any of its representatives or advisors specifically for use or
incorporation by reference therein.

  

  

Section 5.06. Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present
or former officer, director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or any other Person for whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable
or any of their respective properties before (or, in the case of threatened
actions, suits, investigations or proceedings, would be before) or by any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator that relates to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.07. Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and fully executed copies of commitment letters from Deutsche Bank A.G. New
York Branch, Deutsche Bank A.G. Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., together with the
executed fee letter related thereto of even date herewith (which such fee
letter may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would
adversely affect the aggregate amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the debt financing contemplated therein) and any related
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements,
which provide such lenders' respective commitments to provide Parent with debt
financing in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby in the amount set forth
therein (collectively, the "Commitment Letters") (such debt financing, the
"Financing"). Each of the Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and
is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. As of
the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified,
and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not
been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified (and no such withdrawal,
rescission or modification is contemplated). As of the date hereof, there are
no side letters or other arrangements relating to the Commitment Letters that
would reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the funding in full
of the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully paid, or
caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees that have
been incurred and are due and required to be paid in connection with the
Commitment Letters on or prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a material default or breach on the part of
Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters, or otherwise
result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the
Commitment Letters in the form so delivered to the Company. As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any term or condition to
the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters will not be fully satisfied
on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent at the
Closing. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing, together with the cash or
other sources of immediately available funds that Parent has or will have
prior to the Closing, are in an amount sufficient to enable it to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, to refinance any
indebtedness required to be refinanced in connection therewith and to pay any
related fees and expenses.

  

  

Section 5.08. Finders' Fees. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC and Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any
fee or commission from the Company or any of its Affiliates upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.09. No Interested Stockholder. As of the time the Company Board
Recommendation was adopted by the Board of Directors, none of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their "affiliates" and "associates" were, or have been
within the three years preceding such date, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, as those terms are defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law.

  

  

Section 5.10. Non-Reliance. Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge
that, as of the date hereof, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives (a) have received access to (i) such books and
records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company that
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

to review and (ii) the electronic data room hosted by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) have
had the opportunity to meet with the management of the Company. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge and agree that, except for the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 4, (a) none
of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives is relying on any representation or warranty except for those
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in Article 4
and (b) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information,
memorandum, presentation or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives, including any materials or information made available in
the electronic data room hosted by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with
presentations by the Company's management, are not and shall not be deemed to
be or include representations or warranties unless and to the extent any such
materials or information is the subject of any representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in Article 4. Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby
acknowledge that they have conducted their own independent investigation of
the business, operations and financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, in making their determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary have relied on the results of their own independent investigation
and representations and warranties set forth in this Article 4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of claims of
fraud.

best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, (iii) not effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and (iv) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting.

  

  

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall (i)
prepare, subject to receipt of the information to be provided by Parent
pursuant to the final sentence of this Section 6.02(b), and file with the SEC
the preliminary Company Proxy Statement as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, to comply in all material
respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to and resolve
all comments received from the SEC or its Staff concerning the Company Proxy
Statement and all other proxy materials (and the Company shall promptly
provide all such comments to Parent and shall consult with Parent in good
faith in formulating the responses thereto) and (iv) cause the Company Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after resolution of any such comments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information
supplied by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Company Proxy Statement. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall furnish all information concerning it and its
Affiliates, if applicable, as the Company may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Company Proxy Statement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall not, without the consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholder Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the
consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) if
as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Company Proxy Statement) there are insufficient
shares of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (B) if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
Applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to
the Company Proxy Statement or (C) if the Board of Directors of the Company
(or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

including in order to give the Company's stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to its
stockholders or otherwise made available to its stockholders (including in
connection with any Adverse Recommendation Change).

  

  

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in
this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) fail to enforce
or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (v) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vi) except for
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on
the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by the Company.

  

  

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), but subject to compliance
with Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d), at any time prior
to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders:

  

  

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives that has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of Section
6.03(a) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement dated December 15, 2014 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") between the Company and Parent (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"; provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
"standstill" or other similar

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

restrictions (including "non-use" restrictions that operate as an indirect
"standstill")); provided that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party); and

  

  

(ii) Subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a
Superior Proposal or (B) in response to material events or changes in
circumstances arising after the date hereof that were not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Company as of or prior to the date hereof (an "Intervening
Event"),

  

  

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law. For the avoidance
of doubt, notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (x) in no event may
the Company (A) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term
sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) other than as
required by Applicable Law, make, facilitate or provide information in
connection with any SEC or other regulatory filings in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or (C) seek any Third
Party consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal, and (y) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to
all of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from (1) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action or (2) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act.

  

  

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any
of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to
advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms
of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by
the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any
indication that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or
any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Subsidiaries by any Third Party that the Company has reason to believe may be
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and
the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence and written materials (including any amendments to the original
Acquisition Proposal) sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral communications addressing
such matters).

  

  

(d) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal (or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the
Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three Business Days
before taking that action, of its intention to do so, attaching (A) in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior Proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of
the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal, or (B) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, a written offer, capable
of becoming binding if accepted by the Company, that (A) in the case of any
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior
Proposal, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new two Business Day
period under this Section 6.03(d)) or (B) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, obviates
the need for such recommendation change.

  

  

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (with
each reference to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal deemed to be
a reference to "50%" for purposes of this definition) with terms that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable to
the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.03(d)), for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in
part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the
Board of Directors of the Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

  

  

 

  

(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each Third Party, if any, that has (i) executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof
in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
received any material confidential information in connection therewith, to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all
analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contains, reflects or analyzes that information), in each case in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, and the Company
shall provide to Parent all certifications of such return or destruction from
such other Persons as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure all such
certifications as promptly as practicable.

  

  

Section 6.04. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other authorized representatives reasonable access, at regular business
hours and upon prior notice, to the offices, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such
financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with
Parent in its investigation, provided, however, the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that
(a) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate
the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse legal proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand; and provided, further, that if the Company does
not provide access to any document or information in reliance on clauses (a)
through (d) of the foregoing proviso, it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the Applicable Law or applicable Contract or cause a waiver of the
applicable privilege or trade secret right; and provided, further that,
subject to Section 8.02(f), the Company shall provide access to any such
documents or information notwithstanding clauses (a) through (d) to the extent
required by Applicable Law in connection with the consummation of the
Financing. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company hereunder.

  

  

Section 6.05. Consultation as to Certain Tax Matters. Except as set forth in
Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to (a) consummating any
material transaction that (i) is described in clause (b) or (c) of Section
6.01 and (ii) is not subject to Parent's consent right provided in Section
6.01 on the basis that such transaction involves solely the Company and one or
more its Subsidiaries or solely its Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any material
intercompany arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among the
Company and its Subsidiaries or among the Company's Subsidiaries, the Company
shall consult with Parent reasonably prior to consummating any such
transaction and shall not proceed with any such action or transaction
described in clause (a) or (b) hereof without Parent's consent (not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if such action or transaction
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company and without taking into
account any action or transaction entered into by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), reasonably be expected to materially change the Tax position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.06. Certain Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
(including derivative claims) against the Company and/or its directors or
executive officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any
litigation commenced on or after the date of this Agreement against it or any
of its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated hereby or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

  

ARTICLE 7

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.02. Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Subsidiary. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement by the parties, Parent shall cause
the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary to approve and adopt this Agreement,
in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

  

  

Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided
under the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the
date hereof or any indemnity agreements between the Company and their
respective present and former directors and officers in effect as of the date
hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under Applicable Law and such indemnity agreements.

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the comparable organization documents of the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries (or in such documents of any successor to
the business of the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries) regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement, provided, that with respect to the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries, Parent shall have the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.03(b) solely with respect to any
Subsidiary to which any of the individuals set forth in Section 7.03(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule serve as either an officer or director as of the
date hereof.

  

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue to
maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time the Company's
directors' and officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable as those contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies in
effect as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance for
such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the Company's
DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof; provided that if the
aggregate cost for such insurance coverage exceeds 250% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company (which amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Surviving Corporation shall instead be
obligated to obtain DandO Insurance with the best available coverage with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate cost of 250% of the current annual premium. Prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company may, with Parent's prior written consent, purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance, subject to the same cost
restrictions as those applicable to the Surviving Corporation in the proviso
contained in the preceding sentence, provided, that no such consent from
Parent shall be required if the Company is currently required to purchase such
"tail" on terms provided for in its DandO Insurance in effect as of the date
hereof. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Corporation (and Parent) under the first sentence of this Section 7.03(c) for
so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  

  

Section 7.04. Employee Matters. (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2015 (or such shorter period of
employment, as the case may be), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide to each employee who is actively employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a "Covered Employee"), (i)
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits (other than equity compensation and other
long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or
similar arrangements) that, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion,
either (A) were provided to such Covered Employee under the Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) are provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries); and (ii) severance benefits for U.S. employees under the
broad-based severance practice of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries).

  

  

(b) Crediting of Payments. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan")
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting
condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Covered Employee under any Parent
Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Plan such
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such
Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid under an Employee Plan prior to such Covered
Employee's coverage under any Parent Plan during the calendar year in which
such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the
Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under such Parent Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Service Crediting. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee prior to
the Effective Time, with the Company and its Subsidiaries for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for
vacation and severance, as applicable). In no event shall anything contained
in this Section 7.04 result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

  

  

(d) Company 401(k) Plan. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Company's
Profit-Sharing and Employee Savings Plan, pursuant to resolutions of the
Company's Board of Directors that are reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In
connection with the termination of such plan, Parent shall permit each Covered
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all
participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of participant loans) in an
amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributed to each such Covered Employee from such plan to an
"eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company's Board of Directors or the
appropriate committee thereof shall take all actions, including adopting any
resolutions or amendments, with respect to the Company's 2005 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to: (i) cause the "Offering Period" (as defined in
the ESPP) ongoing as of the date of this Agreement to be the final Offering
Period under the ESPP and the options under the ESPP to be exercised on the
earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (y)
the final payroll date prior to the Closing Date (with any participant payroll
deductions not applied to the purchase of shares returned to the participant),
(ii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll
deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and (iii)
terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.04, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee or any former
employee, director, officer or individual independent contract of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or
constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to
amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) to employ any Covered Employee for any period
following the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 7.05. No Adverse Actions. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to not, enter into any transaction the consummation of which
could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the Merger.

  

  

ARTICLE 8

  

Covenants of Parent and the Company

  

  

The parties hereto agree that:

  

  

Section 8.01. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other third party under any Contracts that are necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by defending, contesting and resisting any actual or threatened
claim, suit, action, objection or other proceeding brought by a Governmental
Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Applicable Law, including Antitrust Laws.

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall (i) give the other parties hereto prompt
notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or
action by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties
hereto fully and promptly informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation or action; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties
hereto of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent will
provide copies of any notifications, submissions, analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, opinions and any other documents proposed to be made with
or to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement a reasonable period of time prior to filing or
submitting any such notifications, submissions, analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, opinions and any other documents with such Governmental
Authorities, consult and cooperate in good faith with the other parties hereto
regarding such requests, inquiries, investigations or actions and any such
notifications, submissions, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
opinions and any other documents, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties regarding such requests, inquiries, investigations or actions
and any such notifications, submissions, analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, opinions and any other documents. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law, in

to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such requests,
inquiries, investigations or actions and any such notifications, submissions,
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, opinions and any other document.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 8.01(b), Parent shall have
primary responsibility for scheduling and conducting any meeting with any
Governmental Authority, coordinating and making any applications and filings
with, and resolving any investigation or other inquiry of, any agency or other
Governmental Authority, obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any Governmental Authority that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of any party
hereto shall not be deemed to include (and, without the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company shall be prohibited from) (A) entering into any
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or (B) divesting or otherwise holding separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise), or taking any other action with respect to any of its or
the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates' businesses, assets or properties (or otherwise agreeing to do any
of the foregoing).

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days of the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and to use their reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. All filing fee costs and
expenses by Parent and the Company under the HSR Act or any similar filing
requirement of any Governmental Authority applicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and payable to a Governmental Authority,
shall be paid for the Parent at the time any such fees, costs and expenses
become due and payable.

  

  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 8.01,
pursuant to NASD Rule 1017, the Company shall cause Broker-Dealer to file with

Section 8.02. Financing. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Financing (including, to the extent required, the full
exercise of any flex provisions) at or prior to the Closing, including using
its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letters, (iii) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing, or on such
other terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary (as determined by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in their sole
reasonable discretion) than the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letters (provided that such other terms would not reasonably be
expected to materially delay or hinder the Closing), (iv) satisfy, or cause
their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Representatives in the
Commitment Letters (or definitive agreements entered into with respect to the
Commitment Letters), it being understood that Parent and Merger Subsidiary may
seek to obtain financing in a private placement of securities pursuant to
available exemptions from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act or in
a public offering of securities pursuant to the 1933 Act in lieu of all or a
portion of the Financing (and references to the Financing in this Section 8.02
shall be deemed to include such private placement or public offering, as
applicable); provided, however, that (1) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
not release or waive the Commitment Letters or the obligations of the
arrangers and lenders thereunder and (2) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
proceed with, and consummate, the financing contemplated in the Commitment
Letters in the event that such alternative private placement financing or
public offering financing is not available or would materially delay or hinder
the Closing, (v) prepare the information memoranda, preliminary and final
offering memoranda or prospectuses, registration statements and other
materials to be used in connection with obtaining the Financing prior to the
anticipated date on which all of the conditions in Section 9.01 and Section
9.02 have been satisfied, to the extent reasonably practicable, and (vi) in
the event that all conditions in the Commitment Letters have been satisfied,
cause the lenders and any other Persons providing financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
Commitment Letters as and when they become due to the extent they are required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing,
(ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the Financing, or
otherwise expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay, prevent or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing,
less likely to occur in any material respect, or (iii) materially adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of
the financing agreements or any alternative financing agreement promptly upon
their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any material breach
(or material breach threatened in writing) by any party of any of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Commitments Letters, any alternative financing commitment, the financing
agreements, or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Merger
Subsidiary becomes aware or any termination thereof and (iii) otherwise keep
the Company reasonably and promptly informed of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing); provided that in no
event shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary be under any obligation to disclose
any information pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) that would waive the
protection of attorney-client or similar privilege if such party shall have
used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would
not waive such privilege.

  

  

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including the
flex provisions), (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (B) Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain any such portion from alternative sources on terms, taken as whole,
that are no more adverse to Parent and the Company (including after giving
effect to the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but in no event later than the last day of the
Marketing Period. In furtherance of the provisions of this Section 8.02(c),
one or more Commitment Letters may be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Parent after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments that either
amend, amend and restate, or replace the existing Commitment Letters or
contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other or additional
parties; provided that the terms of the such new or amended commitment letters
shall not (1) expand upon the conditions precedent to the debt financing as
set forth in the existing Commitment Letters, (2) reasonably be expected to
materially delay or hinder the Closing or (3) reduce the aggregate amount of
available financing. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of its intention
to make any such amendment or obtain such alternative financing and keep the
Company reasonably informed of the terms thereof. Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and correct copies of all new or amended commitment letters
(including redacted fee and engagement letters in respect of any new or
amended commitment letters). In such event, the term "Commitment Letters" as
used herein shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letters that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the new or amended commitment letters
to the extent then in effect and the term "Financing" as used herein shall be
deemed to include the financing contemplated by any such new or amended
commitment letters.

  

  

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent
in its efforts to consummate the Financing. Such reasonable best efforts shall
include, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, (i) providing direct
contact between prospective lenders, investors and other Debt Financing
Sources and the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) providing assistance in preparation of information memoranda, preliminary
and final offering memoranda or prospectuses, registration statements,
financial information and other materials to be used in connection with
obtaining such financing, including promptly furnishing any additional
customary information as Parent or the Debt Financing Sources reasonably
request in order to prepare such materials, (iii) cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and the Debt

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Financing Sources for such financing, including participation in a reasonable
number of management presentation sessions, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (iv) providing
assistance in obtaining any consents of third parties necessary in connection
with such financing, (v) providing assistance in extinguishing existing
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and releasing Liens securing
such indebtedness, in each case to take effect at the Effective Time, (vi)
cooperating with respect to matters relating to provision of guarantees and
pledges of collateral to take effect at the Effective Time in connection with
such financing, (vii) assisting Parent in obtaining legal opinions,
organizational documents and customary officer's certificates to be delivered
in connection with such financing, (viii) assisting Parent in securing the
cooperation of the independent accountants of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including with respect to the delivery of accountants' comfort
letters, (ix) causing the taking of corporate actions by the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the completion of such financing,
(x) providing the financial information necessary for the satisfaction of the
obligations and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters within the time
periods required thereby, including, to the extent required under the
Commitment Letters, all financial statements, financial data, audit reports
and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type
that would be required by Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC for a registered offering of debt or equity
securities of the Company, together with drafts of comfort letters customary
for such financing by auditors of the Company which such auditors are prepared
to issue at the time of pricing of such securities and the closing thereof
upon completion of customary procedures (such information referred to in this
clause (x), the "Required Information"; provided that in no event shall the
Required Information be deemed to include or shall the Company otherwise be
required to provide (A) pro forma statements or pro forma adjustments
(including regarding any pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization and
other post-Closing or pro forma adjustments), (B) any description of all or
any component of the Financing, (C) risk factors relating to all or any
component of the Financing, (D) separate financial statements in respect of
its Subsidiaries, or (E) other information required by Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16
of Regulation S-X. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable
best efforts to periodically update any Required Information provided to
Parent as may be reasonably necessary so that such Required Information (i)
meets the condition set forth in the first proviso in the definition of
"Marketing Period", (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Information," and (iii) would not, after giving effect
to such update(s), result in the Marketing Period to cease to be deemed to
have commenced. If the Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has
provided the Required Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice
stating when it believes that it completed such delivery, in which case the
Company will be deemed to have complied with this Section 8.02(d) and the
Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced as of such date unless
Parent in good faith reasonably believes that the Company has not completed
delivery of the Required Information and, within five Business Days after the
delivery of the foregoing notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to
the Company stating in good faith the specific items of Required Information
the Company has not delivered, in which case the Marketing Period shall be
deemed to have commenced when such specific

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

items have been delivered by the Company (provided that all other conditions
to the commencement of the Marketing Period have been satisfied at such time).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.02(d) or any other provision
of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree
to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for
which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified
by or on behalf of Parent, (B) enter into any definitive agreement that is
effective prior to the Effective Time, (C) give any indemnities that are
effective prior to the Effective Time, (D) take any action contemplated by
Section 8.02(d) that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (E) provide any
information or take any action that will conflict with or violate its
organizational documents or any Applicable Laws or would result in a violation
or breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or would result in the waiver of a legal
privilege; provided that if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not
provide access to any document or information in reliance on this clause (E),
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
Applicable Law or applicable Contract or cause a waiver of the applicable
privilege or trade secret right; and provided, further that, subject to
Section 8.02(f), the Company shall provide access to any such documents or
information notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (E) to the
extent required by Applicable Law in connection with the consummation of the
Financing. In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to
any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (including
being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing) contemplated
by Section 8.02(d) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or
that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement
will require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
pursuant to Section 8.02 or any other provision of this Agreement that could
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative, or (B) the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof
to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept

(i) as is legally required to be disclosed in any offering documents related
to the Financing or (ii) to any financing sources or prospective financing
sources, ratings agencies and other financial institutions and investors that
are or may become parties to the Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Financing (and, in each
case,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (x) agree to
be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto, (y) are
subject to other confidentiality undertakings customary for financings of the
same type as the Financing.

  

  

(g) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 8.02 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually
suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with the
arrangement of any Financing and any information used in connection therewith,
except with respect to any information prepared or provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, or to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives, and the foregoing obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of Parent and

making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) except in respect of any public

receipt or public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company's Board
of Directors shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within five Business Days) after

that Parent's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(c)(i) will expire on the fifteen (15th) Business Day following the date
on which such right to terminate first arose; or

  

  

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any

the End Date; or

  

  

(iii) there shall have been an intentional and material breach of Section 6.02

a definitive, written agreement concerning a Superior Proposal; provided, that
the Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to Section 11.04(b) in
accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified therein; or

  

  

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth
in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth
in Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being
cured by the End Date.

liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto;
provided that, if such termination shall result from the intentional (i)
failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to perform a
covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities
and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such

and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the Company

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 11.04. Expenses. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

  

  

(b) Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or Section 10.01(c)(iii), or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i),
then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds
$80,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent,
within one Business Day after such termination and, in the case of a
termination by the Company, immediately before and as a condition to such
termination.

  

  

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(ii) (but only if the failure to satisfy the condition specified
therein results from an intentional breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein), (B)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to
the Board of Directors of the Company or its stockholders and not publicly
withdrawn and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its
stockholders an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been consummated, whether or not with the party that announced or communicated
the Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) above (provided that for
purposes of clauses (B) and (C), each reference to "15%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the
Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with
the occurrence of the applicable event described in clause (C), the
Termination Fee.

  

  

(iii) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether nor not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. Any Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section 11.04(b)(ii) shall be reduced by the full amount of any Expense
Reimbursement Amount previously or contemporaneously paid to Parent pursuant
to Section 11.04(c), and, for avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
aggregate amount of the Company's obligations under Section 11.04(b) and
Section 11.04(c) exceed the amount of the Termination Fee, other than as
contemplated by Section 11.04(d).

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
(on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
financing commitments, the Financing, the financing agreements or in respect
of any other document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or
in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith and the Company (on behalf of itself and
any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the financing
commitments, the Financing, the financing agreements or in respect of any
other document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding
asserted by the Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in connection with
this Agreement, the financing commitments, the Financing, the financing
agreements or in respect of any other document or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or theory of law or equity against any Debt
Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that
no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages to
the Company in connection with this Agreement, the financing commitments, the
Financing, the financing agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. The provisions of this Section 11.04(b)(iv) shall inure to the
benefit of,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68

respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 11.04(b)(iv).

  

  

(c) Reimbursement. Upon any termination of this Agreement by either party
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent, within two
(2) Business Days of such termination, the Expense Reimbursement Amount. The
term "Expense Reimbursement Amount" means all documented out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the arrangement of, obtaining
the commitment to provide or obtaining any financing for such transactions and
the fees and expenses of accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and
financial advisors (but excluding corporate overhead or salaries payable to
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries); provided, however, that in no
event shall the Expense Reimbursement Amount exceed $12,500,000.

  

  

(d) Other Costs and Expenses. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this
Section 11.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense
was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

  

  

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of any
Company Filing shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) the Company's representations and warranties if the relevance of
that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person who
has read that information concurrently with such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; provided that in no event shall any
information contained in any part of any Company Filing entitled "Risk
Factors" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" be deemed to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) any representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that the Indemnified Persons are
third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, Section 7.03

of, and shall have no right to enforce, any other provision of this Merger
Agreement).

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time, (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person and (iii) after the Effective Time, to the Debt
Financing Sources as collateral security; provided that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto
or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state; provided, however, that any legal
suit, action, litigation, proceeding or claim against any Debt Financing

Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of

contract, in tort or otherwise) brought against any Debt Financing Source in
any way connected with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing
commitments or the performance thereof and the parties shall not bring or

INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF, AND BE ENFORCEABLE BY, EACH DEBT FINANCING SOURCE,
ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS, EACH OF
WHICH IS HEREBY INTENDED TO BE AN EXPRESS THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS
SECTION 11.09.

  

  

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

  

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality

the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
and shall not raise any objections asserting that monetary damages would be
adequate remedies in the event of such breach. Any party hereto seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. For avoidance of doubt and without limitation to Section 8.02(h),
the Company's rights to specific performance of Parent and Merger Sub's
obligation to consummate the transaction in accordance with Section 2.01 is
not conditioned on the availability, obtaining or funding of the Financing or
any alternative Financing. With respect to the provisions hereof to which the
Debt Financing Sources are third party beneficiaries (including this Section
11.13), the provisions of this Section 11.13 shall inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, each Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 11.13.
