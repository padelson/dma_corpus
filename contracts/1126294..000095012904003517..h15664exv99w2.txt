                                    ARTICLE I
                          DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

                          PURCHASE AND SALE AND CLOSING

      Section 2.01 Purchase and Sale. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller, and Seller
agrees to sell or cause to be sold to Buyer, the following equity interests (the
"COMPANY INTERESTS"): (i) 100% of the general

Coldwater, and (v) in the event the OPOS Corporate Reorganization is not
completed prior to the Closing Date, 100% of the capital stock of OPOS Carr
Street.

      Section 2.02 Purchase Price.

      (a) The purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller for the Company
Interests is Nine Hundred Million U.S. Dollars ($900,000,000) (the "BASE
PURCHASE PRICE"), as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and Section 2.02(c).

      (b) The Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the
sum of the following amounts:

            (i) an amount equal to the sum of the Federal, state, city and other
      income and franchise Taxes that would be payable with respect to (A) the
      net income and gain of OPOS Coldwater, (B) the net income and gain of OPOS
      Carr Street, (C) the net income and gain of OPNY GP II, (D) the net income
      and gain of Erie allocable to Seller and its Affiliates, and (E) the net
      income and gain of Carr Street allocable to Seller and its Affiliates, in
      each case for the period from February 29, 2004 through the Closing Date
      assuming that (x) such Taxes are imposed on such net income and gain at an
      aggregate rate equal to 39.9%, and (y) the relevant taxpayers realize no
      other Tax Items, and have no other Tax attributes that can be taken into
      account, for such period; provided that the term "income and gain" shall
      not include (1) any income or gain incurred by any of the Companies as a
      result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
      of the OPNY Corporate Reorganization or OPOS Corporate Reorganization or
      the transactions contemplated by Section 6.06 or Section 7.02(d)) or (2)
      any income or gain in connection with the cancellation of Intercompany
      Payables or Intercompany Receivables; and

            (ii) if on a date (the "INTEREST START DATE") that is 90 days or
      more after the Execution Date, all other conditions to the Closing have
      been satisfied or are then capable of being satisfied and the sole reason
      that the Closing has not occurred is that the condition set forth in
      Section 7.01(b)(ii) has not been satisfied, simple interest on the Base
      Purchase Price calculated from and including the Interest Start Date
      through and excluding the Closing Date at the Interest Rate.

      (c) If the Intercompany Adjustment Amount is negative, then the Base
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value of the Intercompany
Adjustment Amount. If the Intercompany Adjustment Amount is positive, then the
Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the Intercompany Adjustment Amount.
Following such adjustments, all Intercompany Payables and Intercompany
Receivables outstanding as of the Closing shall be deemed to be cancelled
immediately prior to the Closing.



                                       2

      Section 2.03 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Vinson & Elkins
L.L.P., 1001 Fannin, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the third
Business Day after the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII (other
than actions to be taken or items to be delivered at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived by the applicable Party or Parties, or on such other date
and at such other time and place as the Parties mutually agree in writing. All
actions listed in Section 2.04 or Section 2.05 that occur on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to occur simultaneously at the Closing. Subject to the
provisions of Article VIII, failure to consummate the purchase and sale provided
for in this Agreement on the date determined pursuant to this Section 2.03 will
not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any Party
of any obligation under this Agreement.

      Section 2.04 Closing Deliveries by Seller to Buyer. At the Closing, Seller
shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to Buyer the following:

      (a) Assignments of Partnership Interests in a form reasonably acceptable
to Buyer and Seller for Erie and Carr Street;

      (b) in the event the OPNY Corporate Reorganization is not completed prior
to the Closing Date, a stock certificate, with a valid stock power executed in
blank, for 100 shares of common stock of OPNY GP II; and in the event the OPOS
Corporate Reorganization is not completed prior to the Closing Date, stock
certificates, with valid stock powers executed in blank for 100 shares of common
stock of OPOS Coldwater and 100 shares of common stock of OPOS Carr Street;

      (c) the certificate described in Section 7.02(c);

      (d) the written resignations of each of the directors or other managers of
the Companies;

      (e) certificates of good standing as of a recent date with respect to each
Company issued by the Secretary of State of its jurisdiction of organization,
and for each state in which such Company is qualified to do business as a
foreign entity;

      (f) an affidavit of non-foreign status as set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b) for each of the Seller Entities, as applicable; and

      (g) mutual releases, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
between Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Companies, on the other hand, of any and all obligations to each other under any
Contracts between or among such parties.

      Section 2.05 Closing Deliveries by Buyer to Seller. At the Closing, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller the following:

      (a) a wire transfer of immediately available funds (to such account as
Seller shall have notified Buyer of at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date) in an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.02(b) and Section 2.02(c), as estimated in good faith by Seller
(the "ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE"). Seller shall deliver a


                                       3
<PAGE>
calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price in writing to Buyer at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and shall attach to the calculation of
the Estimated Purchase Price a schedule showing the estimated adjustments to the
Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and Section 2.02(c); and

      (b) the certificate described in Section 7.03(c).

      Section 2.06 Post-Closing Adjustment.

      (a) As soon as practicable after the Closing, but no later than 60 days
after the Closing Date, Seller shall determine the actual adjustments to the
Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and Section 2.02(c) as of the
Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other access to
their respective books and records (and those of the Companies) as are
reasonably requested in connection with the matters addressed in this Section
2.06. Seller shall provide Buyer with written notice of such determinations,
along with reasonable supporting information (the "SELLER'S POST-CLOSING
ESTIMATE").

      (b) If Buyer objects to any determinations set forth in the Seller's
Post-Closing Estimate, then it shall provide Seller written notice thereof
within 20 Business Days after receiving the Seller's Post-Closing Estimate. If
the Parties are unable to agree on the disputed amounts as of the Closing Date
within 120 days after the Closing Date, the Parties shall refer such dispute to
an internationally recognized accounting firm that is not the principal
accounting firm of either Buyer or Seller, mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Seller, which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to all such
matters in dispute (and only such matters) on a timely basis and promptly shall
notify the Parties in writing of its resolution. Such firm shall not have the
power to modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement. Each Party
shall bear and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by such
accounting firm.

      (c) If the Base Purchase Price adjusted using such actual values (as
agreed or determined by the above-referenced accounting firm) (the "FINAL
PURCHASE PRICE") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall
pay Seller within 10 Business Days after such actual values are agreed or
determined, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price plus interest
thereon at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date through and including the
date of such payment. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay Buyer within 10 Business Days after such
actual values are agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and the
Final Purchase Price plus interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the Closing
Date through and including the date of such payment. In each case, the recipient
Party shall designate the account to which such payment is to be made at least
two Business Days prior to the date such payment is due.

      Section 2.07 Allocation of Purchase Price. Seller and Buyer agree to work
in good faith to agree upon an allocation of the Estimated Purchase Price among
the assets of Erie and Carr Street and among the assets of each successor to
OPNY GP II, OPOS Coldwater or OPOS Carr Street, following any of the OPNY
Corporate Reorganization or the OPOS Corporate Reorganization, in accordance
with applicable Treasury Regulations, within 30 days after the


                                       4
<PAGE>
signing of this Agreement (the "ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION"). Not later
than 30 days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price, Seller and
Buyer shall further agree upon the allocation of any adjustments resulting from
such determination, with such adjustments to be made in a manner consistent with
the Estimated Purchase Price Allocation and in accordance with applicable
Treasury Regulations (as adjusted, the "FINAL PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION"). Buyer
and Seller shall work in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding the
Estimated Purchase Price Allocation and the Final Purchase Price Allocation. If
the Parties fail to agree within such respective 30-day periods upon either the
Estimated Purchase Price Allocation or the Final Purchase Price Allocation, such
dispute shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller, and the decision of such independent accounting firm shall
be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other

name to a name that does not contain any of the Seller Marks.

      Section 6.05 Support Obligations.

      (a) Buyer recognizes that Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates have
provided credit support to the Companies with respect to the Facilities pursuant
to certain credit support obligations set forth on Schedule 6.05(a) (the
"SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS"). Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect the full and unconditional release of Seller and
the Non-Company Affiliates from all Support Obligations, including by:

            (i) furnishing letters of credit containing terms and conditions
      that are substantially identical to the terms and conditions of existing
      letters of credit and from lending institutions that have a Credit Rating
      commensurate with or better than that of lending institutions for existing
      letters of credit;

            (ii) instituting escrow arrangements with terms equal to or more
      favorable to the counterparty than the terms of existing escrow
      arrangements;

            (iii) posting surety or performance bonds issued by a Person having
      a net worth or a Credit Rating at least equal to those of the issuer of
      existing surety or performance bonds, and which replacement surety or
      performance bond contains terms and conditions that are substantially
      identical to the terms and conditions of existing surety or performance
      bonds;



                                       23
<PAGE>
            (iv) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on
      substantially identical terms and conditions to the existing security
      agreement or arrangement; and

            (v) providing substitute guaranties from an Investment Grade entity
      to the counterparty with terms substantially identical to the terms of
      existing guaranties.

      (b) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Support Obligations to terminate and
redeliver to Seller prior to the Closing each original copy of each original
guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or evidencing such
Support Obligations and, as to any Support Obligations terminated after the
Closing, promptly to redeliver such originals to Seller, and in each case, to
take such other actions as may be required to terminate such Support
Obligations.

      (c) If Buyer is not successful in obtaining the complete and unconditional
release of Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates from the Support Obligations
prior to the Closing, then at Seller's option, Seller shall have the right to
waive the performance by Buyer of Section 6.05(a) and Section 6.05(b), and if
Seller does so waive such sections, Buyer shall, at Seller's option, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates from and against
any and all Losses incurred by any such indemnified Persons in connection with
the Support Obligations or shall provide other credit support to Seller in form
and substance satisfactory to Seller. Buyer shall, for so long as any Support
Obligation remains outstanding, not, and shall cause the Companies not to,
effect any amendments or modifications or any other changes to the Contracts to
which any of such Support Obligations relate, or to otherwise take any action
that would effect any change to such Contracts, guaranties or letters of credit,
in either case that adversely affects the rights of Seller or the Non-Company
Affiliates thereunder, without Seller's prior written consent. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the Interim Period, Buyer
shall have the right to contact and have discussions with each beneficiary of a
Support Obligation in order to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.05;
provided, however, that Buyer shall give Seller prior notice before making any
such contact, Seller shall have the right to have one of its Representatives
present on the telephone line or in person, as applicable, during any such
contact or discussion, Buyer shall only contact and hold discussions with such
beneficiaries through Representatives of Buyer previously approved by Seller and
Buyer shall cause such Representatives to comply with all procedures and
protocols regarding such contacts and discussions that may be established by
Seller.

      Section 6.06 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller will, prior to the
Closing Date, cause the Companies to distribute, transfer or assign to Seller
and the Non-Company Affiliates those assets described on Schedule 6.06 (the
"EXCLUDED ASSETS").

      Section 6.07 Termination of Certain Services, Contracts, Receivables and
Payables. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the
Interim Period, (a) Seller shall take such actions as may be necessary to
terminate or sever as to the Companies (with appropriate mutual releases) upon
the Closing any services jointly shared or used by any of the Companies and
Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate, joint Tax services, joint legal services and
joint banking services (to include the severance of any centralized clearance
accounts) and each Contract listed on Schedule 6.07 (the "TERMINATED
CONTRACTS"), (b) the Companies shall be


                                       24
<PAGE>
entitled to transfer cash to Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates if
corresponding Intercompany Receivables or Intercompany Payables have been
created or correspondingly adjusted; provided, that no dividends in respect of
the equity securities of the Companies shall be made in cash, and (c) Seller
shall be entitled to take such actions as may be necessary to settle (through
offsets and/or cash transactions) immediately prior to the Closing such
Intercompany Payables and Intercompany Receivables as Seller, in its sole
discretion, elects to settle.

      Section 6.08 Payment of Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all indebtedness for borrowed
money of the Companies to be paid in full and any and all Liens securing any
such indebtedness or other indebtedness for borrowed money secured by liens on
the Purchased Assets and any and all related guaranties provided by the
Companies (collectively, the "COMPANY LIENS") to be released and any and all
agreements relating to the Company Liens or the indebtedness secured thereby to
be terminated as to the Companies, such that Buyer shall take title to the
Companies and the Purchased Assets free of any such indebtedness or any Company
Liens.

      Section 6.09 Tax Matters.

      (a) Tax Returns.

            (i) Consolidated Tax Returns. Seller shall cause to be included in
      the consolidated federal income Tax Returns (and similar Tax Returns of
      any state, local or foreign jurisdiction that permits consolidated,
      combined or unitary income Tax Returns, if any) of the affiliated group of
      corporations that includes Seller and OPNY GP II, OPOS Coldwater and OPOS
      Carr Street, as applicable (the "SELLER GROUP"), all items of income,
      gain, loss, deduction and credit or other items ("TAX ITEMS") of OPNY GP
      II, OPOS Coldwater and OPOS Carr Street, as applicable, through the
      Closing Date; shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the
      appropriate Taxing Authorities; and shall be responsible for the timely
      payment of all Taxes due with respect to the periods covered by such Tax
      Returns. All transactions occurring on the Closing Date but after the
      Closing shall have occurred shall be reported on Buyer's consolidated
      United States federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by
      Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall be similarly
      reported on other Tax Returns of Buyer or its Affiliates.

            (ii) Partnership Tax Returns. Seller shall prepare or cause to be
      prepared all federal Tax Returns (Forms 1065) and all similar state, local
      or foreign Tax Returns to be filed by or with respect to Erie and Carr
      Street to report to the members of Erie and Carr Street partnership Tax
      Items for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

            (iii) Other Tax Returns. Seller shall cause to be timely filed with
      the appropriate Taxing Authorities all other income or franchise Tax
      Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any Company or the
      Purchased Assets for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
      Date that are not specified in Section 6.09(a)(i) or 6.09(a)(ii), and
      shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes due with respect
      to the periods covered by such Tax Returns.



                                       25
<PAGE>
            (iv) Section 754 Elections. Seller shall cooperate in making an
      election under Section 754 of the Code to adjust the basis of the assets
      of Erie and Carr Street.

            (v) Buyer Tax Returns. Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to
      be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Companies
      after the Closing Date, other than Tax Returns described in Section
      6.09(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) for which Seller is responsible, and shall pay
      or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon.

      (b) Cooperation. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates, including the Companies, to cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by either Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.09 and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of or relating to any Company or the
Purchased Assets (a "TAX PROCEEDING"). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon a Party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

      (c) Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed
to report Transfer Taxes imposed on or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be solely liable for and shall pay all
such Transfer Taxes, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
the Non-Company Affiliates from and against any and all liability for the
payment of such Transfer Taxes and the filing of such Tax Returns.

      (d) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Section 6.09
shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Seller and Buyer. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne
equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other.

      (e) Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits for
any Taxes relating to any Company or the Purchased Assets for periods for which
Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 6.09(a)(a)(i), (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) or
for which Seller is required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02(c), and Buyer shall be entitled to any refunds or credits for any Taxes
relating to any Company or the Purchased Assets for which Buyer is responsible
pursuant to Section 6.09(a)(v) or Section 6.09(c).

      (f) Tax Sharing. Any Tax allocation, indemnity, or similar agreement or
arrangement between Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Company,
on the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and will have
no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year
or a past year).

      (g) Tax Amendment. If either the OPNY Corporate Reorganization or the OPOS
Corporate Reorganization does not occur prior to the Closing, the Parties agree
to enter into an amendment to this Agreement, reasonably acceptable to both
Parties, that will take into account (i) the intent of the Parties to effect
transactions that are equivalent to sales and purchases of the Purchased Assets
for federal, state and local income Tax purposes, and (ii) the fact that certain


                                       26
<PAGE>
transactions will be carried out as sales of corporate entities rather than as
sales of interests in limited liability companies.

      Section 6.10 Certain Restrictions. During the Interim Period, Buyer agrees
that except as may be agreed in writing by Seller or as may be expressly
permitted pursuant to this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not permit any of
its subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire, develop or construct any electric
generation facility, or otherwise obtain control over any electric generation
facility, in each case located in the states of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania or Maryland, or take any action with any Governmental Authority
relating to the foregoing, or agree, in writing or otherwise, to do any of the
foregoing, in each case which could reasonably be expected to materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or result in the
failure to satisfy any condition to consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

      Section 6.11 No Solicitation. During the Interim Period, Seller shall not
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, and Seller shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Affiliates' officers, directors and
employees and any attorney, accountant, investment banker, financial advisor or
other agent retained by it or any of its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit or negotiate or provide nonpublic or confidential
information to facilitate, any proposal or offer with respect to any
acquisition, reorganization, exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving any Company, or any purchase of the voting securities of any Company,
or any material assets or businesses of the Companies, in a single transaction
or a series of related transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

      Section 6.12 Confidentiality. All nonpublic information provided to, or
obtained by, Buyer or its Representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be "Confidential Information" for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 19, 2004 between Buyer and Seller (the
"CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of which shall continue in force until
the Closing; provided, however, that Buyer may disclose such information as may
be necessary in connection with seeking the Buyer Governmental Approvals.

      Section 6.13 Employee and Benefit Matters.

      (a) On or before the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary, if
any, to cause (i) the Companies to cease to be adopting or participating
employers under all Seller Plans and (ii) Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates
to cease to be sponsors or adopting or participating employers under all Company
Plans (and, if Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate is a sponsor of a Company Plan,
Seller shall cause OPOS Coldwater to assume such sponsorship). Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Section 6.13, from and after the
Closing, (i) the Companies shall not have any responsibility or liability with
respect to the Seller Plans and (ii) Seller and the Non-Company Affiliates shall
not have any responsibility or liability with respect to the Company Plans;
provided, however, that, with respect to the Retirement Plan, Seller shall
timely file or cause the appropriate Non-Company Affiliate to timely file (to
the extent the following forms have not been filed prior to the Closing) (A) the
annual report on Form 5500 for 2003 with the Employee Benefits Security
Administration and (B) PBGC Form 1 or PBGC Form l-EZ (as applicable) for 2003
with the PBGC. Buyer shall cooperate, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to
cooperate, with Seller with respect to the filings described in the preceding
sentence,


                                       27
<PAGE>
and Buyer shall provide to Seller such information as Seller may reasonably
request in respect of such filings.

      (b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) certain employees of the
Companies are represented by Local Union 97 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO (the "UNION") pursuant to the terms of the
Collective Bargaining Contract, (ii) OPOS Coldwater will continue to recognize
the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees whose
employment is covered by the Collective Bargaining Contract, (iii) the
Collective Bargaining Contract will continue to be effective until it expires by
its own terms or is renegotiated, and (iv) OPOS Coldwater will continue to be
bound by the terms, conditions and provisions of the Collective Bargaining
Contract. Buyer further acknowledges that, subject to the terms of the
Collective Bargaining Contract, the employees covered by the Collective
Bargaining Contract will continue to be employed by the Companies following the
Closing.

      (c) Within 45 days after the Execution Date, but effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall offer employment (which shall
be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing) to each individual listed on
Schedule 6.13(c) (each, an "AFFILIATE EMPLOYEE"). Each such offer of employment
shall be consistent with the provisions of this Section 6.13(c) and shall remain
open for a period of at least 10 days. For a period of one year beginning on the
Closing Date and subject to the remaining paragraphs of this Section 6.13 and an
individual's continued employment with a Company or an Affiliate of a Company,
Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee to be provided with (i) compensation
(including annual incentive compensation) on a basis substantially similar to
that provided by Seller and its Affiliates to such employee immediately prior to
the Closing and (ii) benefits that are substantially similar to those provided
to such employee under the Company Plans and Seller Plans, as applicable (and
worker's compensation benefits that are substantially similar to those provided
to such employee), by Seller and its Affiliates (including the Companies)
immediately prior to the Closing (other than the Reliant Resources, Inc. 2002
Long-Term Incentive Plan, Reliant Resources, Inc. 2002 Stock Plan and Reliant
Resources, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan); provided, however, that with
respect to Continuing Employees whose employment is covered by the Collective
Bargaining Contract, Buyer shall cause the compensation and benefits provided to
such employees from and after the Closing Date also to be consistent with the
terms of the Collective Bargaining Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.13, subject to the terms of the Collective Bargaining
Contract, each Company or an Affiliate of a Company shall have the right to
dismiss any or all of the Continuing Employees at any time on or after the
Closing Date, with or without cause, and, subject to this Section 6.13 and the
terms of the Collective Bargaining Contract, to change the terms and conditions
of their employment (including compensation and employee benefits provided to
them).

      (d) Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible
dependents (including all such Continuing Employee's dependents covered
immediately prior to the Closing Date by a Company Plan or a Seller Plan that is
a group health plan) to be covered under a group health plan maintained by Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer that (i) provides medical and dental benefits to the
Continuing Employee and such eligible dependents effective immediately upon the
Closing Date and (ii) credits such Continuing Employee, for the year during
which such coverage under such group health plan begins, with any deductibles
and co-payments already incurred during such year under a Company Plan or a
Seller Plan that is a group health plan.



                                       28
<PAGE>
      (e) Buyer shall cause the employee benefit plans and programs maintained
after the Closing by Buyer, the Companies and the Affiliates of Buyer to
recognize each Continuing Employee's years of service prior to the Closing Date
with Seller, the Companies and their Affiliates (including service with any
other employer that was recognized by Seller, the Companies or their Affiliates)
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, and, solely for
purposes of the Retirement Plan, benefit accrual to the same extent such service
was recognized under the corresponding Company Plan or Seller Plan and provided
that such recognition does not result in any duplication of benefits. Buyer
shall cause each employee welfare benefit plan or program sponsored by Buyer or
one of its Affiliates that a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate
in on or after the Closing Date to waive any preexisting condition exclusion
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee to the extent such condition was waived under the
corresponding Company Plan or Seller Plan. Seller and its Commonly Controlled
Entities shall be exclusively responsible for complying with COBRA with respect
to employees of the Companies and their eligible dependents by reason of such
employee's termination of employment prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer, the
Companies and their Affiliates shall not have any obligation or liability to
provide COBRA on account of any such termination of employment.

      (f) Buyer expressly agrees that it assumes all obligations to provide any
required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as
amended, or other applicable Laws, and to pay all severance payments, damages
for wrongful dismissal and related costs, with respect to the termination of any
employee of the Companies that occurs on or after the Closing Date.

      (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall take all necessary
action, if any, to cause the Continuing Employees to be fully vested in their
account balances under the Reliant Resources, Inc. Union Savings Plan and the
Orion Power Holdings, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (collectively, the "SELLER
SAVINGS PLANS") (to the extent not then fully vested) on the Closing Date. As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be
transferred from the trustee of each of the Seller Savings Plans to the trustee
of a defined contribution plan maintained by Buyer (the "BUYER SAVINGS PLAN") an
amount in cash equal to the aggregate account balances of the Company
Participants under each respective Seller Savings Plan determined as of the
transfer date; provided, however, that (i) to the extent any Company Participant
owes any amount to a Seller Savings Plan pursuant to the terms of a loan from
such plan to such Company Participant, an in-kind transfer of such loan shall be
made in lieu of the transfer of cash, and (ii) to the extent any Company
Participant's account is invested in mutual fund shares that can be transferred
to the Buyer Savings Plan, an in-kind transfer of such shares shall be made in
lieu of the transfer of cash. From and after the date of such transfer, Buyer
shall cause the Buyer Savings Plan to assume the obligations of the Seller
Savings Plans with respect to benefits accrued by the Company Participants under
the Seller Savings Plans, and the Seller Savings Plans shall cease to be
responsible therefor. The Companies shall be responsible for, and shall
contribute to each Seller Savings Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date and prior to the transfer described in this paragraph, all unpaid (A)
pre-tax and after-tax contributions to such Seller Savings Plan attributable to
withholdings from the compensation of employees of the Companies with respect to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and (B) employer matching
contributions due with respect to pre-tax and after-tax contributions to such
Seller Savings Plan by employees of the Companies for periods ending on or
before the Closing Date.


                                       29
<PAGE>
For purposes of determining the amount of such employer matching contributions
under the Seller Savings Plans, the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the last
day of a payroll period. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in making all
appropriate arrangements and filings, if any, in connection with the transfer
described in this paragraph. Further, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and take
such actions as are necessary to permit the continuation of loan repayments by
Continuing Employees to the Seller Savings Plans by payroll deductions during
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date of the transfer
described in this paragraph. Seller represents, covenants and agrees with
respect to each of the Seller Savings Plans, and Buyer represents, covenants and
agrees with respect to the Buyer Savings Plan, that, as of the date of the
transfer described in this paragraph, such plan will satisfy the requirements of
Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code and will have received, or a pending
application has been timely filed for, a favorable determination letter from the
IRS regarding such qualified status and covering amendments required to have
been adopted prior to the expiration of the GUST remedial amendment period.

      (h) Claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and
dependents for medical, dental, prescription drug, life insurance, and/or other
welfare benefits ("WELFARE BENEFITS") (other than disability benefits) that are
incurred before the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of the Seller
Plans or the Company Plans, as applicable. Claims of Continuing Employees and
their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for Welfare Benefits (other than
disability benefits) that are incurred on or after the Closing Date shall be the
sole responsibility of Buyer and the Companies. For purposes of the preceding
provisions of this paragraph, a medical/dental claim shall be considered
incurred on the date when the medical/dental services are rendered or
medical/dental supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose or when
the course of treatment began. Claims of individuals receiving long-term
disability benefits under a Seller Plan as of the Closing Date shall be the sole
responsibility of the Seller Plan. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents
for short-term or long-term disability benefits from and after the Closing Date
shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer and the Companies (without regard to
whether the circumstances giving rise to such claim occurred before, on or after
the Closing Date).

      (i) With respect to all employees who terminated from employment with a
Company prior to the Closing Date and who have been, or are eligible to be,
provided with post-retirement medical, dental, disability, life insurance and/or
other welfare benefit coverage as of the Closing Date under a Seller Plan or
Company Plan, the Companies shall assume and/or retain any and all liability
with respect to the provision of such coverages to such terminated employees and
their eligible dependents and beneficiaries on and after the Closing Date. In
addition, the Companies shall extend post-retirement medical, dental,
disability, life insurance and/or other welfare benefit coverages to all
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) who are
eligible for such coverages and subject to such terms and conditions as set
forth in the Collective Bargaining Contract, Company Plan or plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, as applicable. Neither Seller nor any of the
Non-Company Affiliates shall have any liability on or after the Closing Date
with respect to the provision of post-retirement medical, dental, disability,
life insurance and/or other welfare benefit coverages for those persons
described in the preceding sentences of this paragraph.



                                       30
<PAGE>
      (j) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, Seller shall not pay
Continuing Employees (other than Affiliate Employees who are Continuing
Employees, who will be paid by Seller their accrued and unused vacation as of
the Closing Date) their accrued and unused vacation, and the Company, Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer, as applicable, shall provide, without duplication of
benefits, all such Continuing Employees with vacation time rather than cash in
lieu of vacation time for all accrued and unused vacation through the Closing
Date.

      (k) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
to be transferred from the trustee of the master trust that holds the assets of
the Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date to the trustee of a trust established
or maintained by Buyer or a Company to hold the assets of the Retirement Plan
after the Closing Date an amount of cash equal to the Retirement Plan's share of
the assets of the master trust as determined as of the transfer date by the
Reliant Energy, Inc. Benefits Committee (the "BENEFITS COMMITTEE") (which
determination shall be based on the books and records maintained by the trustee
of the master trust). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in making all appropriate
arrangements and filings, if any, in connection with the transfer described in
this paragraph. In addition, (i) on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause the Benefits Committee to cease to be the plan administrator and to
otherwise administer any aspect of the Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date,
and (ii) on the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause OPOS Coldwater to appoint a new
plan administrator for the Retirement Plan effective as of such date. Buyer
shall cause the Retirement Plan to be maintained in accordance with its current
terms for the benefit of Continuing Employees whose employment is not covered by
the Collective Bargaining Contract until at least July 29, 2006; provided,
however, that if changes in the Laws require any such terms to be modified, then
Buyer may change such terms to the extent necessary to comply with such Laws.
Such Continuing Employees shall be given credit under the Retirement Plan for
all service with and compensation earned through the Closing Date from Seller,
the Companies and their Affiliates (including service and compensation with any
other employer that was recognized by Seller, the Companies or their Affiliates)
for purposes of determining eligibility for benefits, the amount of any benefits
or benefit accruals, vesting, and service related levels of benefits under the
Retirement Plan.

      Section 6.14 Public Announcements. Seller and Buyer will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review
and make reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement
with the NYSE, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation; provided, however, that each of the
Parties may issue a press release or make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with or provide more information than is
contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by the other Party, as the case may be; provided further, that each Party
may make disclosures to Persons bound by a confidentiality obligation to the
disclosing Party that covers such disclosed information.

      Section 6.15 Expenses and Fees. Except as expressly provided otherwise
herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions


                                       31
<PAGE>
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, it being
understood that in no event shall the Companies bear any of such expenses.

      Section 6.16 Agreement to Cooperate.

      (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable
Law, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents, approvals or
authorizations of Governmental Authorities required (i) in order to consummate

expeditiously as possible) and (ii) in order to implement the matters set forth
in Schedule 6.02, including through all possible appeals.

      (b) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer
and Seller undertakes and agrees to (i) file (and each Party agrees to cause any
Person that may be deemed to be the ultimate parent entity or otherwise to
control such Party to file, if such filing is required by Law) as soon as
practicable, and in any event prior to 15 Business Days after the Execution

documentation, and (B) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the

conditioned). Each Party shall consult and cooperate in the regulatory review
process and, to the extent practical, (I) promptly notify the other Party of any

Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat; and (III) subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting

      (c) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, Seller and Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts and move expeditiously to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade or energy
regulation law (including the Federal Power Act, as amended, and the FERC's
regulations thereunder, any applicable New York Laws, and the NYPSC regulations
thereunder; the HSR Act; and, if applicable, the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder) that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, but in any event to insure that the Closing occurs no later than the
Termination Date.

      (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to dispose of any of its assets or to limit its freedom of action
with respect to any of its assets or businesses, whether prior to or after the
Closing Date, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, in order to obtain
any waivers, consents, approvals or authorizations or to remove any impediments
to the Closing relating to the HSR Act or any other Law, regulation or order or
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction or other
order in any suit or proceeding relating thereto.

      Section 6.17 Intentionally Omitted.

      Section 6.18 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at any
Party's request and without further consideration, the other Party shall execute
and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as such Party
may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

      Section 6.19 Non-Solicitation. For a period one (1) year from and after
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of the
Companies who are or become employees of Buyer or its Affiliates to leave such
employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (except
pursuant to a general solicitation not targeted at such employees).

      Section 6.20 Insurance. Any claims for which an insurance claim is filed
or pending as of the Closing Date under the insurance policies covering the
Companies and the Purchased Assets and relating to the Companies shall be
administered and collected by Seller (or by a claims handler appointed by
Seller) on behalf of Buyer; provided, that no such claim shall be settled by
Seller (or by a claims handler appointed by Seller) without the prior written
consent of Buyer (except where such settlement would not result in any liability
to Buyer). Any monies received by Seller as a result of such insurance claims
shall be paid over to Buyer.

      Section 6.21 Data. At Closing, Seller shall ensure that the Companies are
in possession of all computer data used in or relating to the businesses of the
Companies and relating to enterprise-wide functions, including financial
accounting, accounts payable, purchasing, work management, materials management,
cash management, logistics, scheduling


                                       33

asset of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                            CONDITIONS TO THE CLOSING

      Section 7.01 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party. The obligations
of the Parties to proceed with the Closing are subject to the satisfaction on or
prior to the Closing Date of all of the following conditions, any one or more of
which may be waived in writing, in whole or in part, as to a Party by such
Party:

      (a) (i) no judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect which has
the effect of making the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
otherwise restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (each Party agreeing to use its reasonable best
efforts, including appeals to higher courts, to have any judgment, injunction,
order or decree lifted) and (ii) no material legal proceedings shall have been
instituted against Seller, the Companies or Buyer seeking to restrain or
prohibit or to obtain substantial damages with respect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that, Seller and Buyer shall use
their reasonable best efforts to have dismissed, settle or otherwise resolve
such legal proceedings;

      (b) (i) any waiting period applicable to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated, and (ii) all Seller Governmental Approvals and Buyer Governmental
Approvals shall have been filed, made or obtained, as the case may be; provided,
however, that a Party whose breach of its obligations under this Agreement
caused a failure to so file, make or obtain such Seller Governmental Approvals
or Buyer Governmental Approvals, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have
waived this condition to the extent of such failure; and

      (c) all consents, waivers and approvals listed on Schedule 7.01(c) shall
have been obtained.

      Section 7.02 Conditions to the Obligations of Buyer. The obligation of
Buyer to proceed with the Closing is subject to the satisfaction on or prior to
the Closing Date of the following further conditions, any one or more of which
may be waived, in whole or in part, by Buyer:

      (a) Seller shall have performed in all material respects all of its
obligations hereunder required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing
Date;

      (b) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement (i) that are qualified as to "material adverse effect" or Material
Adverse Effect shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date, except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date
(in which case as of such earlier date), and (ii) those not so qualified shall
be true and correct as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case as of such earlier date), except for failures of the


                                       34
<PAGE>
representations and warranties referred to in this clause (ii) to be true and
correct as do not and would not reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

      (c) Buyer shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Seller by
an executive officer of Seller indicating that the conditions provided in
Section 7.02(a) and Section 7.02(b) have been satisfied; and

      (d) Buyer shall have received updated title reports (the "UPDATED
REPORTS") with respect to the title insurance policies issued by Chicago Title
Insurance Company and Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation to Erie from July 1999
to August 2000, and issued by Ticor Title Insurance Company to Carr Street on
July 27, 1999. In the event that the Updated Reports reveal Liens, defects,
exceptions, restrictions, easements, rights of way or encumbrances other than
Permitted Exceptions and the Company Liens ("DEFECTS"), and the aggregate cost
of curing such Defects as determined by Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin
(unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer) exceeds one percent (1%) of the
Base Purchase Price, Buyer may, within thirty (30) days after the Execution
Date, submit one notice (the "TITLE NOTICE") to Seller, setting forth in
reasonable detail the Defects and the cost to cure each such Defect, requesting
that Seller take curative action. If Buyer does not deliver the Title Notice to
Seller within thirty (30) days after the Execution Date, this condition shall be
satisfied and Buyer shall not have the right to claim any additional Defects.
Upon receipt of the Title Notice, Seller shall within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Title Notice, elect to do any combination of the following with
the effect that the cost to cure the remaining Defects shall not exceed 1% of
the Base Purchase Price:

            (i) cure such Defects; or

            (ii) unless such transfer would give rise to a Material Adverse
      Effect, transfer one or more Facilities out of the Companies and reduce
      the Base Purchase Price by the market value of the Facility or Facilities
      so transferred as determined by Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin (unless
      otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer).

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a prerequisite to Seller taking such
curative action, Seller must fully discharge all Liens securing indebtedness for
borrowed money (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in
Section 9.02(a)(y) and (z) shall not apply to any payments so made by Seller).

      Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to pay one-half of all fees of title
insurance companies and appraisal firms engaged pursuant to this Section
7.02(d).

      In the event Seller elects to take any of the actions set forth in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the condition set forth this Section 7.02(d) shall be
satisfied when Seller completes the action elected. To the extent Seller fails
to take the curative action specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above and the
aggregate cost to cure remaining Defects (as set forth in the Title Notice)
exceeds 1% of the Base Purchase Price, then this Section 7.02(d) shall remain a
condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close hereunder. Seller will keep
Buyer reasonably informed of any curative actions proposed to be taken;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not have the right to approve any such
curative actions pursuant to this Section 7.02(d).



                                       35
<PAGE>
      Section 7.03 Conditions to the Obligations of Seller. The obligation of
Seller to proceed with the Closing is subject to the satisfaction on or prior to
the Closing Date of the following further conditions, any or more of which may
be waived, in whole or in part, by Seller:

      (a) Buyer shall have performed in all material respects all of its
obligations hereunder required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing
Date;

      (b) the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this
Agreement (i) that are qualified as to "material adverse effect" shall be true
and correct in as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations
and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case as of such
earlier date), and (ii) those not so qualified shall be true and correct as of
the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case as of such earlier date),
except for failures of the representations and warranties referred to in this
clause (ii) to be true and correct as do not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability
to perform its obligations hereunder; and

      (c) Seller shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Buyer by
an executive officer of Buyer indicating that the conditions provided in Section
7.03(a) and Section 7.03(b) have been satisfied.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TERMINATION

      Section 8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

      (a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

      (b) by either Seller or Buyer:

            (i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before 364 days after the
      Execution Date (such date, as it may be extended under clause (A) of this
      paragraph, the "TERMINATION DATE") provided, however, that (A) each of the
      Parties shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to extend the
      Termination Date for an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days if
      all other conditions to Closing (other than the condition described in the
      following clause (B)) are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied and
      the sole reason (other than the condition described in the following
      clause (B)) that the Closing has not occurred by such date is that the
      condition set forth in Section 7.01(a) or (b) has not been satisfied due
      to the failure to obtain the necessary waivers, consents, approvals and
      authorizations under applicable Laws or a judgment, injunction, order or
      decree of a court or other Governmental Authority of competent
      jurisdiction shall be in effect and Buyer or Seller is still attempting to
      obtain such necessary waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations
      under applicable Laws, or is contesting (x) the refusal of the relevant
      Governmental Authority to give such consents or approvals or (y) the entry
      of any such judgment, injunction, order or decree, in court or through
      other applicable proceedings; (B) each of the Parties shall have the
      option, in its sole discretion, to extend


                                       36
<PAGE>
      the Termination Date for an additional period of time, not to exceed 90
      days if all other conditions to Closing (other than the condition
      described in the preceding clause (A) to the extent applicable) are
      satisfied or capable of being satisfied and the sole reason (other than
      the condition described in the preceding clause (A) to the extent
      applicable) that the Closing has not occurred by such date is that the
      condition set forth in Section 7.01(a)(ii) has not been satisfied due to
      the existence of material legal proceedings; and (C) the right to
      terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be
      available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
      been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur by
      the Termination Date; or

            (ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or
      other United States Governmental Authority shall have issued a final
      order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action restraining,
      enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other
      action is or shall have become final and nonappealable, provided, however,
      that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
      Section 8.01(b)(ii) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the
      entry of and to remove such order, decree, ruling or final action;

      (c) by Buyer if there has been a material breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which (x) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a)
or Section 7.02(b) and (y) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date or is
not cured within 20 days following written notification of such breach or such
longer period as may be reasonably necessary to cure such breach but not to
exceed 90 days in the aggregate; and

      (d) by Seller if there has been a material breach by Buyer of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which (x) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a)
or Section 7.03(b) and (y) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date or is
not cured within 20 days following written notification of such breach or such
longer period as may be reasonably necessary to cure such breach but not to
exceed 90 days in the aggregate.

      The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01
(other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give notice of such termination
to the other Party.

      Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Seller or Buyer prior to the Closing pursuant to the
provisions of Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and
there shall be no liability or further obligation on the part of Buyer or Seller
or their respective officers or directors (except as set forth in Section
6.01(b), Section 6.12, Section 6.15, this Section 8.02, Section 9.03, Section
9.04(a), Section 9.04(b), Section 9.04(d), Section 9.04(f) and Article X, all of
which shall survive the termination); provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 8.02 shall relieve any Party from liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement by such Party prior to termination of this Agreement; provided,
further that in the event of a termination of this Agreement by reason of
failure of the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c), as
Buyer's sole remedy, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all of its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including


                                       37
<PAGE>
reasonable fees of its legal and other advisors) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      Section 9.01 Survival. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein, and the right to commence any Claim with respect
thereto, shall terminate upon the date that is eighteen months after the Closing
Date, except that (a) the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.04, Section 4.01, Section 4.03, Section 5.01 and
Section 5.02 shall survive without limitation as to time, (b) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.09 shall survive until 60
days after the end of the period of the applicable statute of limitations
(taking into account any extensions thereof, whether automatic or permissive),
(c) the representation and warranty contained in the first sentence of Section
4.16(b) shall terminate at the Closing and (d) the covenants and agreements of
the Parties contained herein that by their terms are to be performed following
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, shall survive the first anniversary
of the Closing Date and continue in effect in accordance with their terms;
provided, however, that in the event written notice of any Claim for
indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i), Section 9.02(a)(ii), Section
9.02(b)(i), Section 9.02(b)(ii), or Section 9.02(c) shall have been given in
accordance herewith within the applicable survival period setting forth such
Claim in reasonable detail (including a reasonable specification of the legal
and factual basis for such Claim and the Loss incurred), the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements that are the subject of such
indemnification Claim shall survive with respect to that Claim only until such
time as the Claim is fully and finally resolved.

      Section 9.02 Indemnification.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the
Closing, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Group
harmless from and against any and all Losses, whether arising out of contract,
tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise, actually incurred by any of them
to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

            (i) any breach as of the Closing Date of a representation or
      warranty made by Seller herein; and

            (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller herein.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Section
9.02(a)(i) or Section 9.02(a)(ii) (but only with respect to any breach of
Section 6.02) unless (x) a Claim is timely asserted during the survival period
specified in Section 9.01, (y) the Loss with respect to the particular act,
circumstance, development, event, fact, occurrence or omission exceeds $100,000
(aggregating all Losses arising from substantially identical facts) and (z) the
aggregate of all Losses under Section 9.02(a)(i) and Section 9.02(a)(ii) (but
only with respect to any breach of Section 6.02(a)(i) or Section 6.02(a)(ii))
exceeds, on a cumulative basis, 3% of the Final Purchase Price (and then only to
the extent of such excess); provided, that for purposes of determining whether
such deductible has been attained (and for purposes of determining whether a
member of the


                                       38
<PAGE>
Buyer Indemnified Group is entitled to indemnification once such deductible has
been attained), all qualifications as to "material," "materiality," "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar exception or qualifier contained in a representation
shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the aggregate liability of Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Group
arising under or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or
otherwise, shall not exceed 50% of the Final Purchase Price.

      (b) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the
Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Group
harmless from and against any and all Losses, whether arising out of contract,
tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise, actually incurred by any of them
to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

            (i) any breach as of the Closing Date of a representation or
      warranty made by Buyer herein;

            (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer herein;

            (iii) except for matters as to which Seller has agreed to indemnify
      the Buyer Indemnified Group pursuant to Section 9.02(c), the status of any
      of the Non-Company Affiliates as former partners of Erie or Carr Street,
      as relates to liabilities of the Companies in respect of the period before
      the Closing Date, regardless of when the applicable Claims are asserted;

            (iv) any of the matters listed on Schedule 4.06, whether
      attributable to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets and the
      Companies before or after the Closing Date, regardless of when the
      applicable Claims are asserted; and

            (v) except to the extent arising out of or resulting from a breach
      by Seller of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.12,
      Environmental Laws or any environmental conditions to the extent relating
      to the Purchased Assets or the Companies, whether attributable to the
      ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets and the Companies before or
      after the Closing Date, regardless of when the applicable Claims are
      asserted.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
not be liable for any Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Section
9.02(b)(i) or Section 9.02(b)(ii) unless a Claim is timely asserted during the
survival period specified in Section 9.01.

      (c) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Group
harmless from and against any and all Losses in respect of (i) all income or
franchise Taxes of or relating to any Company or the Purchased Assets for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) all Taxes of any
member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any
Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by reason of the
liability of any such Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) and (iii) any
and all liabilities for federal, state, local or foreign Taxes incurred as a
result of any adjustment provided for in Section 2.02(c).



                                       39
<PAGE>
      Any claim for indemnity under this Section 9.02(c) may be made at any time
prior to 60 days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (taking into account any
extensions thereof, whether automatic or permissive).

      In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 9.02(c),
on the one hand, and the provisions of Section 9.02(a), on the other, the
provisions of this Section 9.02(c) shall control.

      Section 9.03 Waiver of Other Representations.

PROVIDED, THAT THIS SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV AND THE LAST SENTENCE OF
SECTION 6.13(g).

      (b) EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV OR THE LAST SENTENCE OF SECTION 6.13(g). AS OTHERWISE
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, (A) SELLER'S INTERESTS IN THE COMPANIES ARE BEING
TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY INTERESTS "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL
FAULTS," AND (B) SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF

anything in this Agreement to the contrary:



                                       40
<PAGE>
      (a) the Parties hereby agree that, except for actual fraud, neither Party
shall have any liability, and neither Party shall make any Claim, for any Loss
or other matter, under, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other document, agreement, certificate or other matter delivered pursuant
hereto, whether arising out of contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or
otherwise, except as expressly set forth in Section 6.01(b), Section 8.01,
Section 8.02, Section 10.05 and this Article IX. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that

incurrence or payment of such Losses, and (ii) increased by the amount of any

      (f) the Parties shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable efforts

      (h) Buyer hereby releases, waives and discharges forever Seller and the
Non-Company Affiliates from all present and future Claims and from all Losses,

Environmental Law.

      Section 9.05 Procedures for Indemnification.

      (a) Whenever a Claim shall arise for indemnification under Section 9.02
(other than under Section 9.02(b)(iv)), the Person entitled to indemnification
(the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the Party from which
indemnification is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of such Claim and, when
known, the facts constituting the basis of such Claim; provided, however, that
in the event of a Claim for indemnification resulting from or in connection with
a Claim by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall give such notice thereof
to the Indemnifying Party not later than 10 Business Days prior to the time any
response to the third party Claim is required, if possible, and in any event
within 15 Business Days following receipt of notice thereof (provided, that
failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure). Following receipt of notice of any such third party Claim, and
unless counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably determined in good
faith that the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be
inappropriate due to a conflict of interest, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the option, at its cost and expense, to assume the defense of such matter and to
retain counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party) to defend
any such claim or legal proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for any fees of other counsel or any other
expenses (except as expressly provided to the contrary herein) with respect to
the defense of such Claim, other than reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the
option of joining the defense of such Claim (which shall be at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnified Party) with counsel not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnifying Party and counsel for each party shall, to the extent consistent
with such counsel's professional responsibilities, cooperate with the other
party and any counsel designated by that party. In effecting the settlement or
compromise of, or consenting to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any
such Claim, the Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, shall act in good faith, shall consult with the other party and shall enter
into only such settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
as the other party shall consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement, compromise or judgment not made in accordance with the preceding
sentence.



                                       42
<PAGE>
      (b) Buyer shall promptly and diligently defend, prosecute or settle the
matters described in Section 9.02(b)(iv) (including the defense of any members
of the Seller Indemnified Group that are defendants or respondents with respect
to such matters). If Buyer's counsel shall have advised Buyer in writing, in
which case Buyer shall deliver a copy to the Indemnified Party, or if the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes, that there is a conflict of interest that
could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct
to have common counsel, the Indemnified Party may retain its own counsel with
respect to such defense and Buyer shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses of counsel for such Indemnified Party. Buyer shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, before entering into or making
(or allowing the Companies to enter into or make) any settlement or compromise
of the matters described in Section 9.02(b)(iv) if (i) such settlement or
compromise does not include a full release of the Indemnified Party, (ii) such
settlement or compromise includes any non-monetary remedy binding on the
Indemnified Party or (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that Buyer
will not have the ability to satisfy fully its obligations pursuant to Section
9.02(b)(iv) at the time of such settlement or compromise.

      (c) After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall grant each other (or
their respective designees), and Buyer shall cause the Companies to grant to
Seller (or its designees), access at all reasonable times to all of the
information, books and records relating to the Companies in its possession, and
shall afford such party the right (at such party's expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any Claims arising
under, this Agreement. Further, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Companies to grant to Seller (or its designees) the access and right to take
extracts and make copies described in the preceding sentence for such other
purposes as Seller may reasonably request.

ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN CURRENT CENTER FOR PUBLIC RESOURCES
RULES FOR NON-ADMINISTERED ARBITRATION IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT
("CPR RULES") BY THREE ARBITRATORS WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN EMPLOYED BY
EITHER


                                       44
<PAGE>
PARTY, AND WHO DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT OR INDIRECT INTEREST IN EITHER PARTY OR THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION. EACH PARTY SHALL SELECT ONE ARBITRATOR AND
THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC RESOURCES SHALL SELECT ONE ARBITRATOR, ALL IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE "SCREENED" APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE CPR RULES. UNLESS
BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, ALL ARBITRATORS SHALL BE SELECTED FROM THE CPR
NATIONAL PANEL OF DISTINGUISHED NEUTRALS. EITHER PARTY MAY INITIATE ARBITRATION
BY WRITTEN DEMAND TO THE OTHER PARTY AND THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED
ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING: (i) EACH PARTY SHALL DIVIDE EQUALLY THE COST OF THE
ARBITRATORS AND THE HEARING AND EACH PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN
EXPENSES AND THOSE OF ITS COUNSEL AND REPRESENTATIVES; (ii) EVIDENCE CONCERNING
THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE PARTIES, ANY OFFER MADE OR THE DETAILS OF ANY
NEGOTIATION PRIOR TO ARBITRATION AND THE COST TO THE PARTIES OF THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES AND COUNSEL SHALL NOT BE ADMISSIBLE IN THE ARBITRATION; (iii)
THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES, AND BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C.
1-16 TO THE EXCLUSION OF STATE LAWS INCONSISTENT THEREWITH, AND JUDGMENT UPON

THE ARBITRATORS SHALL SET FORTH IN WRITING AT THE TIME THEY RENDER THEIR AWARD,
THE DETAILED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW UPON WHICH THEIR AWARD IS
BASED; (viii) UNLESS THE PARTIES OTHERWISE AGREE, THE ARBITRATION HEARINGS SHALL
BE CONTINUOUS SUBJECT TO WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS, OR OTHER DAYS TO BE MUTUALLY AGREED
AND THE TOTAL DAYS OF HEARING SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN (10) HEARING DAYS PER PARTY;
(ix) THE ARBITRATORS ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO AWARD DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF

                                       45
<PAGE>
NO EVENT SHALL THE BRIEFS DELAY THE ARBITRATORS' DECISION IN THIS MATTER. AN
APPEAL MAY BE TAKEN UNDER THE CPR ARBITRATION APPEAL PROCEDURE FROM ANY FINAL
AWARD OF AN ARBITRAL PANEL IN ANY ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT THAT IS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH APPEAL
PROCEDURE. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW TO BE APPLIED TO THE ARBITRATORS' FINDING OF
FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW SHALL BE THE SAME AS THAT APPLIED BY AN APPELLATE
COURT REVIEWING A DECISION OF A TRIAL COURT SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. UNLESS
OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES, THE APPEAL SHALL BE CONDUCTED BEFORE THE
DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL ARBITRATION OCCURRED. THE
PROCEDURES SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10.05 SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
PROCEDURES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT A PARTY MAY FILE A COMPLAINT
TO SEEK A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OR OTHER PROVISIONAL JUDICIAL RELIEF, IF IN IT
SOLE JUDGEMENT SUCH ACTION IS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO PENDING
APPOINTMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR. DESPITE SUCH ACTION, THE PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO
PARTICIPATE IN GOOD FAITH IN THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10.05. THE
PARTIES AGREE THIS CONSTITUTES A CONSPICUOUS LEGEND.

      (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A
LAWSUIT CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHICH IS
COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION, OTHER THAN TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO
PENDING ARBITRATION, TO COMPEL ARBITRATION, OR TO ENFORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD,
AND THAT THE ARBITRATION AWARD SHALL BE BINDING AND FINAL SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT
OF APPEAL SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.05 REGARDING ARBITRATION.

      (c) WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION PERMITTED BY THIS SECTION 10.05, THE
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE
OR FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

      Section 10.06 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      Section 10.07 Amendments; Extensions.

      (a) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

      (b) At any time a Party may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the covenants or agreements of the other Party contained herein. Any agreement

                                       46
<PAGE>
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

      Section 10.08 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
negotiations, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, inducement, promise,
understanding, condition or warranty not set forth herein has been made or
relied upon by any Party. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof is
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder except as expressly provided otherwise in Section 6.01(b),
Section 6.05, Section 6.09(d), Section 6.13 and Article IX.

      Section 10.09 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Law, or public policy (including any term or provision of Section
10.05), then such term or provision shall be severed from the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement (including the remaining terms and provisions
of Section 10.05), and such remaining terms and provisions shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect.

      Section 10.10 Seller Guarantor Guaranty. Seller Guarantor is a party to
this Agreement solely for the purposes of this Section 10.10. In consideration
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, Seller Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees payment and performance by Seller of the obligations of
Seller under this Agreement, subject to any defenses of Seller. In no event
shall the aggregate liability of Seller Guarantor and Seller arising under or
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
based in contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise, exceed 50% of
the Final Purchase Price. Capitalized terms used in this Section 10.10 shall

irrevocably guarantees Buyer's payment in full, as and when due, of the Base
Purchase Price and any amount payable by Buyer under Section 2.06(c), subject to

                            SECTION 1 - CONSTRUCTION

      (a) All Article, Section, Subsection, Schedules and Exhibit references
used in this Agreement are to Articles, Sections, Subsections, Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The Exhibits and
Schedules attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are
incorporated herein for all purposes.

      (b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean "includes without
limitation" or "including without limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or Article in which such
words appear and any reference to a Law shall include any amendment thereof or
any successor thereto and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Currency amounts referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars.

      (c) Time is of the essence in this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement
refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless
Business Days are specified. Whenever any action must be taken hereunder on or
by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken on or
by the next day that is a Business Day.

      (d) Seller may, at its option, include in the Schedules items that are not
material, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not
be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items are material
or would cause a Material Adverse Effect, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this
Agreement. Information disclosed in the Schedules shall constitute a disclosure
for all purposes under this Agreement notwithstanding any reference to a
specific Section, and all such information shall be deemed to qualify the entire
Agreement and not just such Section.

      (e) Each Party acknowledges that it and its attorneys have been given an
equal opportunity to negotiate the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting Party or any similar rule operating against the drafter of
an agreement shall not be applicable to the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.
