Statement_ ") calculating and setting forth SE Corps (i) good faith estimate,
in the case of the First Closing, of the Estimated Working Capital in respect
of the Working Capital Companies and (ii) calculation, in the case of each
Closing, of the Third Party Indebtedness Balance in respect of all Companies
to be contributed, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the

(b) The consideration to be issued or paid (as applicable) by SEP to each
Contributor at each Closing as described in Section 2.2 (except the SE
Capital-Steckman Ridge Loan Payment) shall be increased or decreased in
accordance with this Section 2.3(b).

(i) _Working Capital_. On the First Closing:

(A) If the Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the Target Working Capital is a
positive number, SEP shall pay in cash to SE Transmission an amount equal to
Y% of the sum of the Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the Target Working
Capital, and SEP shall pay in cash to MLP GP an amount equal to X% of the sum
of the Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the Target Working Capital.

Capital, and MLP GP shall pay in cash to SEP an amount equal to X% of the sum
of the Target Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Working Capital.

(ii) _Third Party Indebtedness_. 

(A) _MLP GP and SE Transmission_. On the First Closing:

 

(1) If the Target Third Party Indebtedness Balance in respect of, in the
aggregate, SE Transmission II and the Companies held directly or indirectly
by SE Transmission II (to the extent an interest therein is being contributed
on the First Closing) _minus_ the aggregate Third Party Indebtedness Balance

aggregate, SE Transmission II and the Companies held directly or indirectly
by SE Transmission II (to the extent an interest therein is contributed on the
First Closing) _minus_ the aggregate Third Party Indebtedness Balance of such
Companies as of the First Closing Date is a negative number: the Base
Cash Consideration otherwise payable to MLP GP shall be decreased by an
amount equal to X% of the aggregate Third Party Indebtedness Balance of such
Companies as of the First Closing Date _minus_ the aggregate Target Third
Party Indebtedness Balance in respect of such Companies, and the SE
Transmission (SE Transmission II) Unit Consideration shall be decreased by a
number of Common Units equal to (x) Y% of such number divided by (y) the Base
Unit Price (such number of Common Units rounded upward, if such calculation
does not result in a whole number of Common Units).

(B) _MLP GP_. By way of further adjustment to any adjustment made pursuant to
clause (A) above in respect of MLP GP, on the First Closing:

respect of, together, Steckman Ridge GP, LLC and Steckman Ridge, LP (to
the extent contributed on the Second Closing) divided by (y) the Base Unit

such Company as of such Closing Date is a positive number: the SE SESH First
Closing Consideration, the SE SESH Second Closing Consideration, or the SE

that would otherwise be received by any Contributor pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(i) or Section 2.3(b)(ii) in respect of Working Capital or Third Party
Indebtedness, all such adjustments for such Contributor shall be set off, such

to MLP GP and SE Transmission, comprising the sum of (i) the Base Cash

provisions of Section 2.4.

(d) The Second Closing Exchanged GP Units and the Third Closing Exchanged GP
Units shall not be subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.3 and

or paid by SEP for purposes of this Section 2.3. 

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Closing Cash Distribution_.

 

(a) Within 75 days following the First Closing Date, SEP shall prepare and
deliver to SE Corp a statement (the " _Initial Statement_ ") calculating and
setting forth in accordance with GAAP the actual Working Capital on the First
Closing Date in respect of the Working Capital Companies, which statement
shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how such amount
was calculated. The Initial Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Agreed Valuation Principles. If SEP does not deliver the Initial Statement to
SE Corp within 75 days following the First Closing Date, then, at the
election of SE Corp, either (A) SE Corp may prepare and present the Initial
Statement within an additional 75 days thereafter or (B) the Estimated Working
Capital of the Working Capital Companies shall be deemed to be the Final
Working Capital in respect of the Working Capital Companies, in accordance
with the last sentence of Section 2.4(f). If SE Corp prepares the Initial
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, all
references to "SE Corp" in Sections 2.4(b) and 2.4(d) shall be deemed to be
references to "SEP" and all references to "SEP" shall be deemed, in Sections
2.4(b) and 2.4(d), to be references to "SE Corp".

 

(b) During the 60 days immediately following SE Corps receipt of the Initial
Statement (the " _Distribution Adjustment Review Period_ "), SEP shall permit
SE Corp and its Representatives to review SEPs working papers and any working
papers of SEPs independent accountants, in each case, relating to the
preparation of the Initial Statement and the calculations related thereto, as
well as all of the financial books, ledgers and records related thereto (the "
_Financial Records_ "), and SEP shall make reasonably available to SE Corp 

 



24  the individuals responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used
in, and the preparation or calculation of, the Initial Statement. SE Corp
acknowledges and agrees that access to the working papers of SEPs
independent accountants may be conditioned upon SE Corps execution of a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to SEPs
independent accountants.

(c) SEP shall, following the First Closing through the date that the
Final Statement becomes such in accordance with the last sentence of Section
2.4(f), take all actions necessary or desirable to maintain and preserve all
Financial Records, policies and procedures on which the Initial Statement is
based or on which the Final Statement is to be based so as not to impede or
delay the determination of the amounts set forth in the Initial Statement or
the preparation of the Notice of Distribution Adjustment Disagreement or the
Final Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods permitted by this
Agreement.

(d) In the event that SE Corp concludes that the Initial Statement or any
amount set forth therein has not been prepared on the basis required by this
Agreement, SE Corp shall submit a written notice to SEP on or prior to the
expiration of the Distribution Adjustment Review Period (the " _Notice
of Distribution Adjustment Disagreement_ "), which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis of SE Corps disagreement, the amounts involved
and the proposed determination of the dispute amount. If no Notice of
Distribution Adjustment Disagreement is received by SEP on or prior to the
expiration date of the Distribution Adjustment Review Period, then the Initial
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by SE Corp and shall become
final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 2.4(f).

(e) During the 30 days immediately following the expiration of each
Distribution Adjustment Review Period (the " _Distribution Adjustment
Consultation Period_ "), the Parties shall seek in good faith to resolve any
disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Distribution Adjustment Disagreement.

(f) If, at the end of the Distribution Adjustment Consultation Period, the
Parties have been unable to resolve all disagreements that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Distribution Adjustment
Disagreement, then the Parties shall submit separate written statements
setting forth in detail their respective positions with respect to all matters
that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Distribution Adjustment
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Statement marked to indicate
those line items that are in dispute) to Ernst and Young LLP or such other
independent certified public accounting firm qualified and of national
recognition in the United States as that is mutually agreeable to the parties
and that they cooperate in good faith to appoint (the " _Independent
Accountant_ ") promptly thereafter. Within 30 days after the submission of
such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on the Parties, on the
basis of the Agreed Valuation Principles and in accordance with this Section
2.4(f), of the appropriate amount of each of the matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Distribution Adjustment Disagreement.
There shall be no _ex parte_

 



25   __communications between either Party, on the one hand, and the Independent
Accountant, on the other hand, relating to those matters in dispute, other
than the initial written submission by the Parties of their respective
positions on the matters in dispute and written answers by the Parties to
written questions from the Independent Accountant. With respect to each
disputed line item, the Independent Accountant s determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either Party, shall not be in excess of the
highest, nor less than the lowest, of the amounts advocated in the Notice of
Distribution Adjustment Disagreement or in the Initial Statement with respect
to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters in the Notice of Distribution
Adjustment Disagreement that remain in dispute. The statement setting forth
the combined Working Capital of the Working Capital Companies that is final
and binding on the Parties, as determined either through agreement of the
Parties (deemed or otherwise) pursuant to Section 2.4(b), Section 2.4(d) and
this Section 2.4(f) or through the determination of the Independent Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.4(f), is referred to herein as a " _Final
Statement_ ", and the determination of the combined Working Capital of the
Working Capital Companies set forth in the Final Statement is referred to as
the " _Final Working Capital_ ".

 

(g) The cost of the Independent Accountants review and determination shall be
shared equally by the Parties. During any review by the Independent
Accountant, the Parties shall each make available to the Independent
Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records and work
papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant
to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.4(f); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the independent accountants of the Parties shall not be obligated to make
any working papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until
the Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 

(h) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall apply in respect of the First
Closing only and shall be an amount equal to the Final Working Capital of the
Working Capital Companies _minus_ the Estimated Working Capital of the Working
Capital Companies. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then
SEP shall pay cash in such amount to MLP GP (as to X% of such amount) and SE
Transmission (as to Y% of such amount), which payment shall be sourced by SEP
solely from debt proceeds under indebtedness that meets all the requirements
of Section 6.14(c). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then
MLP GP (as to X% of the Post-Closing Adjustment) and SE Transmission (as to Y%
of the Post-Closing Adjustment) shall pay cash to SEP, without the issuance of
any additional equity in SEP to MLP GP or SE Transmission in respect thereof.
Any such payment shall be made within three Business Days after the relevant
Final Statement becomes such, together with interest thereon, from the First
Closing Date through the date on which the applicable Post-Closing Adjustment
is paid, at the Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance with
Section 2.8. To the extent any such payment is made by MLP GP or SE
Transmission, such payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the part of
the Cash Distribution made to MLP GP or SE Transmission (as applicable) for
all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

generally or, as to enforceability, by general equitable principles (the "

Agreement, the execution and delivery by each Contributor of the Transaction
Documents to which such Contributor is or will be a party, the performance of

time to review any or all of the Transactions or (ii) consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the Transactions at the behest of any Government
Entity. Each of SE Corp and SEP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
supply promptly any information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to any applicable Laws in connection with such filings or
submissions.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information,
SE Corp and SEP shall promptly notify each other of any communication such
Party receives from any Government Entity (other than communications for
purely logistical purposes) and permit such other Party to review in advance
any proposed applications, notices, filings, submissions, undertakings,
correspondence and communications of any nature (including responses to
requests for information and inquiries from any Government Entity) by such
Party, as applicable, to any Government Entity and shall provide such other
Party with copies of all applications, notices, filings, submissions,
undertakings, correspondence and communications of any nature (including
responses to requests for information and inquiries from any Government
Entity) between such Party, as applicable, or any of its Representatives,

 



51  on the one hand, and any Government Entity or members of the staff of any
Government Entity, on the other hand, in each case to the extent relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, except with respect to Taxes (which are covered by Section 6.8).
Except with respect to Taxes (which are covered by Section 6.8), neither Party
shall agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Government
Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement
(including in respect of satisfying or obtaining the SEP Approvals and the
Contributor Approvals) or any of the other Transaction Documents unless such
Party consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Government Entity, gives such other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting or discussion. SE Corp and SEP shall coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as each other may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing and shall keep each other informed of the status of
discussions relating to obtaining or concluding the SEP Approvals and the
Contributor Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
require SE Corp and SEP or any of their respective Affiliates (i) to disclose
any information that in the reasonable judgment of such Party or any of its
respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any privileged information or
confidential competitive information of such Party or any of its respective
Affiliates or (iii) to disclose the valuation of, or any communications
analyses or other work product regarding the valuation of, all or any part of
(A) the Conveyed Interests, (B) the Total Unit Consideration, the Second
Closing Exchanged GP Units and the Third Closing Exchanged GP Units, (C) the
Companies or (D) the Companies assets. If either Party seeks to withhold
information from the other Party for any reason permitted by this Section
6.4(d), such withholding Party shall nonetheless provide a redacted version of
the information so withheld to the other Party and, subject to the
requirement that such outside counsel not disclose the unredacted version to
any other Person, a complete, unredacted version of the same to the outside
legal counsel of the other Party. Neither Party shall be required to comply
with any provision of this Section 6.4(d) to the extent that such compliance
would be prohibited by applicable Law.

Section 6.5  _Supplemental Disclosure_. Any Disclosure Schedule may, from
time to time, prior to the tenth day before a Closing Date on which any
representations and warranties to which such Disclosure Schedule relates are
required by Section 7.2(a) to be true and correct, be supplemented or amended
with respect to any event, condition, fact or circumstance that arises or with
respect to which Knowledge is first obtained after the date of this Agreement,
that would cause or constitute an inaccuracy in, or breach of, any such
representation or warranty. The Person supplementing or amending its
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") shall deliver a copy of the
amendment or supplement, which shall clearly identify and highlight the
relevant changes to such Disclosure Schedule (the " _Supplemental Disclosure_
") to SE Corp, if SEP is the Disclosing Party, or to SEP, if SE Corp is the
Disclosing Party (in each case, the " _Receiving Party_ "). The Receiving
Party shall have ten days after receipt of such Supplemental Disclosure (the "
_Termination Period_ ") in which to review the Supplemental Disclosure. If a
Supplemental Disclosure discloses facts that would constitute a breach of the
Disclosing Partys representations and warranties hereunder and such breach
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the condition to any
future Closing specified in Section 7.2(a)(i), if SE Corp is the Disclosing

 



52  Party, or Section 7.3(a), if SEP is the Disclosing Party, to be satisfied at
such Closing, then the Receiving Party may terminate this Agreement by
delivering a written notice of termination to the Disclosing Party prior to
the expiration of the Termination Period (which termination notice shall
specify the representation or warranty breached, identify the specific facts
in the Supplemental Disclosure that constitute the breach and describe why
the failure of the condition to such Closing would reasonably be expected to
occur). If a notice of termination is not received with respect to any
Supplemental Disclosure within the Termination Period, the Receiving Party
will be deemed to have waived its right to terminate with respect to such
Supplemental Disclosure and the relevant Disclosure Schedule will be deemed,
solely for the purpose of the Receiving Partys condition to the relevant
Closing as set forth in Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a), as applicable,
and not for any other purpose under this Agreement (including the
indemnification provisions in Article IX), to be amended and supplemented as
described in the Supplemental Disclosure as of the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Supplemental Disclosure (whether or not a notice of
termination is received with respect thereto during the Termination Period)
shall be deemed to have amended or supplemented the relevant Disclosure
Schedule for purposes of the condition to Closing set forth in Section
7.2(a)(iv).

Section 6.6  _Insurance; Damage or Casualty Loss_.

(a) If between the date hereof and a Closing Date on which a Company is to be
directly or indirectly contributed, in whole or in part, to SEP, SE Corp and
its Affiliates become aware of a loss that has occurred to all or any portion
of such Companys properties prior to such Closing, which such loss (i) is
potentially covered by any of the Policies and (ii) exceeds the applicable
deductible under such Policy, then SE Corp and its Affiliates shall cause the
applicable Company to file a claim with the applicable insurance carriers
and shall pay or cause to be paid to the applicable Company any insurance
proceeds received for such loss.

(b) If between the date hereof and a Closing Date on which a Company is to be
directly or indirectly contributed, in whole or in part, to SEP, SE Corp and
its Affiliates become aware of any claim of liability made against such
Company or a circumstance arises that may give rise to a liability claim
against such Company prior to such Closing, and such claim or circumstance (i)
is potentially covered by any of the Policies and (ii) exceeds the applicable
deductible under such Policy, then SE Corp and its Affiliates shall cause the
applicable Company to file a claim with the applicable insurance carriers and
shall pay or cause to be paid to the applicable Company any insurance proceeds
received for such loss.

 

(c) Subject to Section 6.6(d), between the date hereof and the latest Closing
Date on which a Company is to be directly or indirectly contributed, in whole
or in part, to SEP, SE Corp shall not, and shall cause such Company not to,
voluntarily compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable by reason of any
losses or claims referenced in Section 6.6(a) or Section 6.6(b) in excess of
$50,000,000 in the aggregate without first obtaining the written consent of
SEP, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) In respect of any Company that is not, for the entire period referred to
in Section 6.6(c), wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by SE Corp, SE Corp
shall not be

 



53  obligated to prevent any compromise, settlement or adjustment as described
in Section 6.6(c) except to the extent that SE Corp has the power and
authority, pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the relevant Company
or pursuant to any Contract, to prevent the occurrence of such compromise,
settlement or adjustment. To the extent that any such compromise, settlement
or adjustment would, pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the relevant
Company or to any Contract, require the vote or consent of SE Corp or any
Affiliate of SE Corp, SE Corp shall (or shall cause such Affiliate to) vote
against such compromise, settlement or adjustment or withhold its consent to
such compromise, settlement or adjustment unless SEP has provided its consent
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

Section 6.7 _Pre-Closing Credit Support_. Within 30 days after the earliest
Closing Date on which a Company is to be directly or indirectly contributed,
in whole or in part, to SEP, SEP shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the
name of SEP or its Affiliates, replacement bonds, guaranties and letters of
credit (each a " _Replacement Credit Support_ ") for all bonds, guaranties and
letters of credit posted by SE Corp or any of its Affiliates with respect to
such Company (each a " _Pre-Closing Credit Support_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the amount of each Replacement Credit Support shall be equal to the
product of (a) the aggregate value of the Pre-Closing Credit Support being
replaced and (b) the direct or indirect percentage interest of SEP in such
Company following the relevant Closing. Following each Closing, SEP shall, and
shall cause each of the Companies in which SEP has a direct or indirect
interest after such Closing to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless SE Corp and its Affiliates from and against the product of (i) any
and all Losses in respect of any such Company arising from or relating to any
Pre-Closing Credit Support with respect to which SEP has not obtained a
Replacement Credit Support and (b) the direct or indirect percentage ownership
interest of SEP in such Company. SE Corp shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to SEP in connection with
SEPs efforts to obtain each Replacement Credit Support pursuant to this
Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Indemnity by SE Corp; Refunds_. Subject to Section 9.4(h), SE Corp
shall be liable for and indemnify the SEP Indemnified Parties for (i) Taxes
imposed on or with respect to any Company, to the extent contributed directly
or indirectly to SEP on any Closing Date, or for which such Company may
otherwise be liable for any taxable year or period that begins before such
Closing Date and ends on or before such Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_
") and, with respect to any taxable year or period beginning on or before and
ending after such Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such
taxable year or period ending at the end of such Closing Date, including any
such Taxes for which the relevant Company may be liable as a transferee or
successor, (ii) the portion of the Transfer Taxes for which SE Corp is liable
under Section 6.8(d), (iii) Taxes attributable to any taxable year or period
beginning on or before such Closing Date imposed on the relevant Company
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Law, other than, in the case of this clause (iii), any such
Taxes attributable to any affiliated group of which SEP or any of its
Affiliates (other than the relevant Company) is the

 



54  common parent and (iv) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Company
as a result of the Restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , SE Corps liability
for Taxes hereunder shall be reduced to take into account the amount of any
such Taxes taken into account in determining the relevant Companys Financial
Statements Current Liabilities and any portion of any Taxes attributable to
interests in the relevant Company not acquired by SEP. To the extent any of
the Taxes described in the previous sentence gives rise to any Tax deduction
or Tax credit for any SEP Indemnified Party, the amount which shall be payable
pursuant to this Section 6.8(a) shall be determined in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 9.8(c). SE Corp shall be entitled to any
refund of Taxes of a Company received for any Pre-Closing Period of such
Company and, with respect to any Straddle Period of such Company, for the
portion of such taxable year or period ending at the end of the relevant
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , SE Corps entitlement to a refund of
Taxes hereunder shall be reduced to take into account the amount of any such
refund of Taxes taken into account in determining the relevant Companys
Financial Statements Current Assets. With respect to any Tax, this indemnity,
and to the extent the indemnity in Section 9.2 covers the subject matter
of this Section 6.8, that indemnity, shall survive until the date that is 90
days after the relevant Tax Authority is no longer entitled to assess or
reassess any Person in respect of such Tax.

 

(b) _Computation of Tax Liabilities_. For purposes of Section 6.8(a), whenever
it is necessary to determine the portion of any Taxes of a Company for a
Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of such taxable year or
period ending at the end of the relevant Closing Date, the determination shall
be made, (i) in the case of any property or ad valorem Taxes which are
imposed on a periodic basis, ratably on a per diem basis, and (ii) in the case
of any other Taxes, based on an interim closing of the books of the relevant
Company as of the end of the relevant Closing Date;  _provided_ that any
transaction taking place, or item of income or gain arising, outside of the
ordinary course of business on such Closing Date after the Closing shall be
deemed for the purposes of Section 6.8(a) to have taken place or arisen after
such Closing Date.

(c) _Tax Treatment of Tax Indemnity Payments_. Any payment by SE Corp under
Section 6.8(a) will be an adjustment to the Cash Distribution for Tax
purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, gross receipts, transfer
(including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing,
recordation and other similar Taxes, together with any interest, additions or
penalties with respect thereto, arising out of or in connection with, or
resulting directly from, the Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be
borne one-half by SE Corp and one-half by SEP, except that any interest,
additions and penalties that arise as a result of a Persons failure to timely
and properly pay its portion of the Transfer Taxes shall be borne exclusively
by such Person. SEP and SE Corp shall cooperate in preparing and
timely filing with the required Tax Authorities all Tax Returns for or with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(e)  _Cooperation with Respect to Taxes_. After the relevant Closing after
which a Company is directly or indirectly held, in whole or in part, by SEP,
SEP and SE Corp shall cooperate in good faith in respect of any Tax matters
relating to such Company

 



55  (including Tax audits, Tax Return preparations, and Tax Return filings) and
keep each other reasonably informed about such matters on a timely basis. From
and after such Closing, neither SEP nor any of its Affiliates (nor any
Companies directly or indirectly held, in whole or in part, by SEP) shall
agree to settle any Tax claim in respect of such Company that may be the
subject of indemnification by SE Corp under Section 6.8(a) without the prior
written consent of SE Corp, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(f) _Amendments, Etc._

(i) Neither SEP nor its Affiliates (nor any Companies directly or indirectly
held, in whole or in part, by SEP) shall, except as otherwise required by Law,
(A) re-file or amend any Tax Returns of any Company for any Pre-Closing
Period or for any Straddle Period of that Company without the prior written
consent of SE Corp, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, or (B) request an audit by any Tax Authority that may
result in an assessment for any Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period of a
Company without the prior written consent of SE Corp, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, SE Corp shall not be liable for
indemnification for any Taxes that arise as a direct result of a breach by SEP
of the covenants contained in this Section 6.8(f)(i).

 

(ii) Neither SE Corp nor any of its Affiliates shall, except as otherwise
required by Law, (A) re-file or amend any Tax Returns of any Company without
the prior written consent of SEP, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (B) request an audit by any Tax Authority
that may result in an assessment of a Company without the prior written
consent of SEP, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SEP
shall not be liable for indemnification for any Taxes that arise as a
direct result of a breach by SE Corp of the covenants contained in this
Section 6.8(f)(ii).

(g) _Cancellation of Certain Tax Sharing Agreements_. Prior to the last
Closing after which a Company is directly or indirectly contributed, in whole
or in part, to SEP, all Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity and similar
agreements, arrangements and understandings between such Company, on the one
hand, and SE Corp or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the
other hand, shall be terminated with respect to such Company, and such Company
will have no Liability under any such agreement, arrangement or understanding
after the relevant Closing.

Section 6.9 _Transfer Requirements_. SE Corp shall take or cause to be taken
all actions necessary or appropriate to satisfy or waive the Transfer
Requirements applicable to the Transactions and to facilitate the consummation
of the Transactions in accordance with the Organizational Documents of each
Contributor and the Companies and the Conveyed Contracts, and SEP shall
cooperate with SE Corp and execute or cause to be executed appropriate
instruments of assignment, novation, release or termination and other
instruments that may be required to effectuate the Transactions and pursuant
to the Organizational Documents of each Contributor and the Companies and the
Conveyed Contracts.

 



56 Section 6.10 _Intercompany Agreements_. Prior to or concurrently with the
First Closing, SE Corp shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, terminate
all Intercompany Agreements to which any Company is a party existing prior to
the First Closing, except for Continuing Intercompany Agreements and any
Intercompany Agreements that by their terms will cease to include SE Corp or
its Affiliates as parties upon the First Closing.

Section 6.11  _Financial Statements_.

(a) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the First Closing, SE
Corp shall deliver to SEP, as soon as reasonably feasible, copies of the 2013
Unaudited Financials and any monthly reports and quarterly or annual financial
statements of the Companies, in each case, prepared in the ordinary course
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the First Closing, in a format
historically utilized by the Companies. SE Corp shall deliver to SEP from time
to time copies of any further monthly reports and quarterly or annual
financial statements of the Companies that are not held, directly or
indirectly, as to 100% by SEP after the First Closing, in each case, prepared
in the ordinary course after the First Closing and prior to the Third Closing,
in a format historically utilized by the Companies.

 

(b) No later than 70 days after the First Closing Date, SE Corp shall deliver
the following financial statements to SEP, each on a GAAP basis (including
respective balance sheets, statements of income and cash flows and applicable
footnotes), in such form as may be required by Rule 3-05(a) of Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Securities Act to be filed with the Commission by SEP
as a result of the Transactions consummated on or before such Closing Date,
together with the unqualified audit opinion of the independent public
accountants of the Companies for the financial statements in clause (i)
below (collectively, the " _Required Financials_ "): (i) audited combined
financial statements of the Companies at and for the years ended December 31,
2010, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 and (ii) unaudited combined
financial statements on a GAAP basis of the Companies at and for any period(s)
for 2013 as may be required by Rule 3-05(a) of Regulation S-X.

 

(c) From the date hereof until delivery of the Required Financials to SEP in
accordance with Section 6.11(b), SE Corp shall keep SEP informed, and consult
with SEP on a regular basis, with respect to the preparation of the Required
Financials, including by promptly providing SEP with copies of any drafts of
the Required Financials and promptly informing SEP of any correspondence and
communications with the independent public accountants of the Companies
relating to the Required Financials.

(d) SE Corp shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
independent public accountants of the Companies to provide to SEP no later
than the date on which the Required Financials must be filed with the
Commission any consent necessary to the filing of the Required Financials with
the Commission and any such customary representation letters as are necessary
in connection therewith, _provided_ , _however_ , that SEP shall cooperate
with and assist SE Corp and its Affiliates and the auditors engaged by the
Companies, including promptly providing any information reasonably requested
by any of them.

 



57 Section 6.12 _Intercompany Payables and Intercompany Receivables_. Prior to
the First Closing, SE Corp shall (and shall cause its Affiliates, if
applicable, to) cancel and extinguish any and all Non-Ordinary Course
Intercompany Payables and Non-Ordinary Course Intercompany Receivables of each
Company (except the SE Capital-Steckman Ridge Loan, which shall be assigned
at the First Closing as set forth in this Agreement).

Section 6.13  _Third-Party Consents; Assignments_. From the date of this
Agreement SE Corp shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and SEP
shall cooperate with SE Corps efforts to obtain) all consents, approvals,
waivers, authorizations, notices or filings required to be obtained by each
Company from, or to be given by such Company to, or made by such Company with,
any Person that is not a Government Entity pursuant to the matters set forth
on Section 6.13 of the SE Corp Disclosure Schedule and any other Contracts,
if any, to which such Company is a party and as to which a consent, approval,
waiver, authorization, notice or filing is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Transactions affecting such
Company.

 

Section 6.14 _Tax Treatment; Section 704(c); Transaction Recourse Debt_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that the contribution of the Contributed Equity
Interests to SEP and the payment of the Cash Distribution by SEP are properly
characterized as transactions, respectively, described in Section 721(a) and
731 of the Code.

(b) The Parties hereby agree that, for purposes of applying Section 704(c) of
the Code to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, SEP shall adopt
the remedial method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) with respect
to the difference between fair market value and adjusted tax basis, as of each
relevant Closing Date, of the assets treated as having been contributed to it
for U.S. federal income tax purposes on such Closing Date (" _Built-in Gain_
"). For purposes of determining Built-in-Gain pursuant to this Section
6.14(b), the Parties shall agree to cooperate in good faith in the preparation
of a schedule reflecting the relative fair market value of the interests
contributed to SEP and of underlying assets of the Companies (" _Allocation
Schedule_ "). Within 90 days following the Closing, SE Corp shall submit a
draft Allocation Schedule to SEP for its review and reasonable comment.
Within 15 days after the receipt of such draft Allocation Schedule, SEP shall
submit any comments it may have to the draft Allocation Schedule to SE Corp,
and SE Corp shall consider these comments in good faith. Within 15 days after
receipt of such comments, SE Corp shall prepare, and submit to SEP, a final
Allocation Schedule.

(c) The Parties understand and agreed that, prior to the First Closing, SEP
shall enter into one or more credit facilities all or a portion of the
proceeds of which shall be used to fund the payment of the excess of the
Closing Cash Distribution over $500 million. All borrowings pursuant to such
facilities shall be referred to as " _Base Distribution Debt_ " and SEP shall
cause the terms of the Base Distribution Debt to include provisions necessary
to cause 

 



58  the Base Distribution Debt to constitute MLP GP Recourse Liability. The
Parties have agreed to take such steps as may be appropriate to cause a
portion of the Base Distribution Debt at least equal to the excess of the
Closing Cash Distribution over $500 million to be allocable to the Base Cash
Distribution pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(b)(1) and
Temporary Treasury Regulation Section 1.163-8T. The Parties intend that the
distribution of the proceeds of the Base Distribution Debt shall qualify as a
"debt-financed transfer" not taken into account as part of a "disguised sale"
of property contributed to SEP under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.707-3 and
1.707-5(b).

(d) During the greater of (i) the original term to maturity of the
Base Distribution Debt (but in any event no longer than 10 years) and (ii)
the period of four (4) years following the First Closing, the Parties shall
ensure (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to ensure) that MLP
GPs "allocable share" of the Base Distribution Debt (or any "refinancing" of
such borrowing treated as the liability it refinances pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.707-5(c)) will not be less than the entire
outstanding principal balance of the Base Distribution Debt outstanding
immediately after the First Closing.

(e) The Parties shall act at all times in a manner consistent with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.14, except with the prior written
consent of SE Corp or as otherwise required by applicable Law following a
final determination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a Government
Entity with competent jurisdiction.

Section 6.15 _SEP Equity Offerings_. SEP shall not use SEP Restricted Equity
Proceeds to directly or indirectly fund distributions pursuant to Article 6 of
the SEP Partnership Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt this Section 6.15
shall not limit SEPs ability to utilize SEP Restricted Equity Proceeds to
fund capital expenditures of SEP or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
acquisitions, mergers or joint ventures).

Section 6.16 _Net Worth of MLP GP_. MLP GP will maintain a net value (as
determined pursuant to the principles of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-2(k)(2), applying those principles as if MLP GP were a disregarded
entity for federal income tax purposes) that is not less than the principal
amount of the Base Distribution Debt outstanding immediately after the First
Closing, together with all other indebtedness of SEP that immediately after
the First Closing constitutes an MLP GP Recourse Liability, which amount will
be reduced by principal payments by SEP on such indebtedness and which amount
will not be increased by any new borrowings by SEP.

 

Section 6.17 _Further Assurances_. Each of the Parties shall execute and
deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents and
other instruments and shall take, or shall cause to be taken, such further
actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and give effect to the Transactions.

 

Section 6.18 _Distributions_.

(a) If any distribution of cash is made by any Company (other than a Working
Capital Company) after the direct or indirect contribution of all or part of
such 

 



59  Company to SEP pursuant to this Agreement, and such distribution is related
to a period of time that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date of
such contribution (a " _Distribution Straddle Period_ "), SEP shall, promptly
upon its receipt of any such cash distribution attributable to its direct or
indirect interest in such Company, pay to the relevant Contributor an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the amount of such cash distribution
attributable to SEPs direct or indirect interest in such Company and (ii) the
quotient of (A) the number of days in the period beginning on the first day of
the Distribution Straddle Period and ending on and including the relevant
Closing Date and (ii) the total number of days in the Distribution Straddle
Period. To the extent designated in writing by the relevant Contributor prior
to closing, any payment by SEP pursuant to this Section 6.18(a) shall be
characterized as a retention by such relevant Contributor of the right to its
share of the cash distribution by the relevant Company for the Distribution
Straddle Period.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, SE Corp agrees on behalf of itself and each
Contributor that, notwithstanding any provision of the SEP Partnership
Agreement to the contrary:

(i) none of the SE Transmission First Closing Unit Consideration, the SE SESH
First Closing Unit Consideration, the SE Sabal Trail Unit Consideration or the
MLP GP First Closing Unit Consideration shall be entitled to receive, and each
Contributor waives any right in respect thereof to receive, any quarterly
cash distribution from SEP to SEP unitholders that is attributable to any
quarterly period that ends prior to the First Closing, whether or not the
First Closing Date is prior to the record date for such quarterly cash
distribution; 

(ii) none of the SE SESH Second Closing Unit Consideration or the SE
Transmission Second Closing Unit Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
and each Contributor waives any right in respect thereof to receive, any
quarterly cash distribution from SEP to SEP unitholders that is attributable
to any quarterly period that ends prior to the Second Closing, whether or not
the Second Closing Date is prior to the record date for such quarterly cash
distribution; and

(iii) the SE SESH Third Closing Unit Consideration shall not be entitled to
receive, and each Contributor waives any right in respect thereof to receive,
any quarterly cash distribution from SEP to SEP unitholders that is
attributable to any quarterly period that ends prior to the Third Closing,
whether or not the Third Closing Date is prior to the record date for such
quarterly cash distribution.

 

Section 6.19 _Reimbursement of Capital Expenditures_. Payments of cash by SEP
to SE Transmission and MLP GP pursuant to Article 2 or Section 6.18(a) that
are not funded with Base Distribution Debt shall be treated as a reimbursement
of capital expenditures to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-4(d).

 

Section 6.20 _Capital Accounts/Amendment_. The Parties agree (i) that for
purposes of determining the increases in the Capital Accounts (as defined in
the SEP Partnership Agreement) of SE Transmission and the MLP GP with respect
to the contribution of property in exchange for

 



60  the Unit Consideration, the contributed assets shall be valued by reference
to the fair market value of the Common Units issued net of any distributions
waived pursuant to Section 6.18(b), and (ii) the MLP GP shall take steps to
amend the SEP Partnership Agreement so as to suspend the application of
Section 6.1(d)(iii) of such agreement with respect to such waived
distribution. It is the intent of the Parties that as a result of the
application of this provision, following the distribution that is subject to
waiver under Section 6.18(b), the per Unit Capital Accounts attributable to
the Common Units included in the Unit Consideration shall be the same as
the per Unit Capital Account attributable to all other Common Units of SEP.

expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and

delay or impair the ability of SEP to consummate the Transactions to be
consummated at the First Closing or otherwise to perform its obligations under
this Agreement; and

 



63 (ii) In respect of the Second Closing and the Third Closing,
the representations and warranties of SEP set forth in Sections 5.1 (

expected to result in a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities,
capitalization, business, financial condition or results of operations of
SEP.

The conditions in this Section 7.3(d) shall apply in respect of the First
Closing and not in respect of the Second Closing or Third Closing.

_ARTICLE VIII_

_TERMINATION_

Section 8.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to the First Closing by the mutual written consent of SE
Corp and SEP.

 



64 Section 8.2 _Termination by SE Corp or by SEP_. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the First Closing by SE Corp or by SEP:

(a) by giving written notice of such termination to SEP, in the case of a
termination by SE Corp, or to SE Corp, in the case of a termination by SEP, if
the First Closing has not occurred by December 31, 2013 (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.2(a) shall not be available to SE Corp or to SEP where the
failure of SE Corp or the failure of SEP, as applicable, to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the failure of the
First Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date;

(b) by giving written notice of such termination to SEP, in the case of a
termination by SE Corp, or to SE Corp, in the case of a termination by SEP, if
any court of competent jurisdiction or a Government Entity shall have issued
an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material part of the Transactions and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.2(b) shall not be available to SE Corp or to SEP where the
failure of SE Corp or the failure of SEP, respectively, to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement has caused or resulted in such order, decree,
ruling or action; or

(c) by giving written notice of such termination to SEP, in the case of a
termination by SE Corp, or to SE Corp, in the case of termination by SEP,
pursuant to Section 6.5.

Section 8.3 _Termination by SE Corp_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the First Closing by SE Corp if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by SEP in this Agreement,
or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the
date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
or Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied, and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) 30 calendar
days after written notice thereof is given by SE Corp to SEP and (ii) one
Business Day prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ that SE Corp is not then in
material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.2(a)(ii) not to be
satisfied.

 

Section 8.4 _Termination by SEP_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the First Closing by SEP if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by SE Corp in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth
in Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.2(a)(ii) would not be satisfied, and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the
earlier of (i) 30 calendar days after written notice thereof is given by SEP
to SE Corp and (ii) one Business Day prior to the Outside Date; _provided_
that SEP is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.3(a) or Section
7.3(b) not to be satisfied.

 



65 Section 8.5 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and have no effect, and no Party shall have any
liability to the other Party or its respective Affiliates, or its or their
respective partners, directors, officers or employees, pursuant to this
Agreement except for the obligations of SE Corp and SEP contained in this
Section 8.5 and in Article X (and any related definitional provisions set
forth in Article I). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
8.5 shall relieve SE Corp or SEP from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

_ARTICLE IX_

_SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; CERTAIN REMEDIES_

 

Section 9.1 _Survival_. (a) The representations and warranties in Sections 3.1
( _Organization and Good Standing_ ), 3.2 ( _Corporate Authorization_ ), 3.3
( _Ownership of the Conveyed Interests_ ), 3.4(a) ( _Non-Contravention_ ), 4.1
( _Organization and Good Standing_ ), 4.2 ( _Corporate Authorization_ ), 4.3 (
_Capitalization_ ), 4.4 ( _Non-Contravention_ ), and 4.18 ( _No Brokers or
Finders_ ) of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Fundamental
Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely, (b) the representations and
warranties in 4.14 ( _Employee Benefit Matters_ ) and 4.15 ( _Tax Matters_ )
shall survive the Closings until the date that is 90 days after the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto (taking into
account any extensions or waivers thereof), (c) the representations and
warranties in Section 4.12 ( _Properties_ ) and Section 4.13 ( _Environmental
Matters_ ) shall survive for a period of three years from the First Closing
Date and (d) all other representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive the Closings for a period of 20 months from the First Closing Date, at
which time they will terminate (and no claims with respect to such
representations and warranties shall be made by any Person
for indemnification under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 thereafter). All
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Closings will survive for the period provided in
such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully performed. All
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
their entirety on or prior to a Closing shall terminate at that Closing. The
period during which any such representation and warranty survives is the "
_Survival Period_ " for such representation and warranty. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any representation or warranty that would otherwise terminate shall
survive with respect to Losses in respect of which notice, in reasonable
detail, is given pursuant to this Agreement prior to the end of the Survival
Period for such representation or warranty until such Losses are finally
resolved and paid. For the avoidance of doubt, SE Corps obligations with
respect to the Retained Liabilities and SEPs obligations with respect to the
Company-Related Indemnity Matters shall survive indefinitely.

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by SE Corp_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4, SE Corp hereby
agrees that it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, without duplication,
SEP, its Affiliates (including the Companies, to the extent held directly or
indirectly by SEP after such Closing and fulfilling the requirements of the
definition of Affiliate in this Agreement) and their respective directors,
managers, officers, shareholders, members, partners, trustees and

 



66  employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (the " _SEP Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Losses actually suffered or incurred by any of the SEP Indemnified
Parties, to the extent arising out of:

(i) from and after each Closing, any breach of any representation or warranty
in Article III or Article IV of this Agreement, made by SE Corp at the date of
this Agreement or as of the relevant Closing Date, for the period such
representation or warranty survives; 

(ii) from and after each Closing, any breach by SE Corp of any covenant or
agreement made by SE Corp in this Agreement and required by this Agreement to
be performed on or before the relevant Closing; and

(iii) the Retained Liabilities.

(b) For purposes of this Section 9.2, whether any representations and
warranties have been breached, and the determination and calculation of any
Losses resulting from such breach, shall be determined without giving effect
to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the word "material" and
the term "Material Adverse Effect").

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by SEP_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4, SEP hereby agrees
that it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless SE Corp and its Affiliates,
directors, officers, shareholders, trustees and employees and their heirs,
successors and permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such (the "
_Contributor Indemnified Parties_ " and collectively with the SEP Indemnified
Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses
actually suffered or incurred by any of the Contributor Indemnified Parties,
to the extent arising out of:

 

(i) from and after each Closing, any breach of any representation or warranty
in Article V, made by SEP at the date of this Agreement or as of the relevant
Closing Date, for the period such representation or warranty survives;

 

(ii) from and after each Closing, any breach by SEP of any covenant or
agreement made by SEP in this Agreement and required by this Agreement to be
performed on or before the relevant Closing;

(iii) from and after the First Closing, the Company-Related Indemnity
Matters; and

(iv) from and after the First Closing, the SE US Liabilities.

(b) For purposes of this Section 9.3, whether SEP has breached any of its
representations and warranties herein, and the determination and calculation
of any Losses resulting from such breach, shall be determined without giving
effect to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the word "material"
and the term "Material Adverse Effect").

 



67 Section 9.4 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Except with respect to (i) Taxes or (ii) any Loss arising out of any
breach of (A) any representation or warranty in Section 4.15 or (B) any of
the Fundamental Representations, SE Corp shall not be liable to the SEP
Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to the matters contained in
Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate of all Losses therefrom for
which SE Corp would otherwise be liable exceeds an amount equal to
$106,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), after which SE Corp shall only be liable
for Losses in excess of the Deductible.

 

(b) Except with respect to (i) Taxes or (ii) any Loss arising out of any
breach of (A) any representation or warranty in Section 4.15 or (B) any of
the Fundamental Representations, SE Corp shall not be liable to the SEP
Indemnified Parties with respect to the matters contained in Section 9.2(a)(i)
for any individual Loss (or series of related Losses arising from a common
set of facts), except to the extent such individual Loss (or series of related
Losses arising from a common set of facts) exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Mini-
Basket_ "), and any such individual Losses (or series of related Losses
arising from a common set of facts) not in excess of the Mini-Basket will not
be aggregated for purposes of calculating the Deductible in Section 9.4(a).

 

(c) In no event shall SE Corps aggregate liability to the SEP Indemnified
Parties for Losses with respect to the matters contained in Section 9.2(a)(i)
exceed $1,060,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "), except with respect to (i) Taxes or
(ii) any Loss arising out of any breach of (A) any representation or warranty
in Section 4.15 or (B) any of the Fundamental Representations, in which case
SE Corps aggregate liability to SEP Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) for such Losses shall not exceed an amount equal to the Cash
Distribution.

 

(d) In no event shall SEPs aggregate liability to the Contributor Indemnified
Parties for Losses with respect to matters contained in Section 9.3(a)(i)
exceed $1,060,000,000. In no event shall SEPs aggregate liability to the
Contributor Indemnified Parties in respect of the SE US Liabilities pursuant
to Section 9.3(a)(iv) exceed $50,000,000. 

(e) As to any Losses claimed by an SEP Indemnified Party and suffered by a
Company, 100% of such Losses (and not just the percentage thereof that
represents SEPs interest in such Company) shall be counted towards the
Deductible and the Cap hereunder. To the extent any SEP Indemnified Party
other than a Company has a claim under Section 9.2(a)(i) or under Section
6.8(a) for Losses suffered by any of the Companies, such SEP Indemnified Party
shall only be entitled to recover the percentage of such Losses that
represents SEPs interest in the relevant Company.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliate has
been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of
this Agreement.

 



68 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable under this Article IX for any
exemplary, punitive, special, consequential, incidental or indirect damages,
including lost profits or diminution of value or any loss of goodwill or
possible business after any Closing, whether actual or prospective, except to
the extent any such damages are included in any Third-Party Claim against a
SEP Indemnified Party for which such SEP Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(h) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event
or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder. In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so
mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided
had the Indemnified Party made such efforts. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, after an Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of any fact
or circumstance that results in or reasonably would be expected to result in
an indemnified Loss or a Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party
may have Liability to such Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party promptly and implement such reasonable actions
as the Indemnifying Party shall request in writing for the purposes of
mitigating the possible Losses arising therefrom.

Section 9.5 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party
(other than those relating to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 6.8) (a
" _Third-Party Claim_ ") such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event more than ten days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a
Third-Party Claim, notify the party or parties from whom indemnification is
sought (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such Third-
Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder
to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of
the final amount of such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought
thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the
extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim
Notice_ "). However, the failure to give prompt notice will not affect the
rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 15 days (or such lesser number of days set forth
in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceedings in the event of a
litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ")
to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim. For purposes of this Article IX, any
existing or future claims related to the Retained Liabilities or the Company-
Related Indemnity Matters shall be subject to the same procedures as Third-
Party Claims.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party 

 



69  Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and
control such defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to
employ a single separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall
participate in any such defense at its expense unless the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of
outside counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel would
be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them,
in which case the Indemnified Party shall participate in such defense and
employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys expense. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a
basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction
or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (ii) a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume its own defense; _it_
_being_ _understood_ that the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for
a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of
such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third-Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees.

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.5 shall be construed as a waiver
by an Indemnified Party or an Indemnifying Party of any privilege, including
any privilege associated with separate counsel as described herein.

Section 9.6 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Article IX, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that
is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in
good faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party ( _provided_ , that, in the event of a good faith dispute
with respect to a Loss, the

 



70  Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the portion of such Loss, if any, that
is not subject to dispute). In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to
the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than 30 days
following any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys
liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (a) the parties
to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (b) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment
or (c) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-
appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties to such dispute
have agreed to submit thereto.

Section 9.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made
by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim
pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 hereof shall be treated as adjustments
to the Cash Distribution to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Tax
Law.

Section 9.8 _Adjustments to Losses_.

(a)  _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person, net of any actual costs or expenses incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted. In the
event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party with
respect to any occurrence, claim or Loss that results in a payment by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article IX, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment; _provided_ that until
the Indemnified Party recovers full payment of the Loss, any and all claims
of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of said
indemnity payment are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right
of payment to the Indemnified Partys rights against such third
party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision
hereof, each Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate
in the prosecution of such claims.

(b) _Cash Distribution Adjustment_. In calculating the amount of any Loss for
which SEP is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the amount of any reserve
or other negative provision related to such Loss shall be deducted to the
extent reflected in the Final Statement and taken into account for any
adjustment to the Cash Distribution or other adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.

(c) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an
amount equal to any Tax benefit (including the utilization of a Tax loss or
Tax credit carried forward) as a result of such Loss by the party claiming
such Loss. The amount of adjustment for any such Tax benefit shall equal (i)
in the case of a Tax deduction, (A) the amount of the Tax deduction multiplied
by (B) the applicable combined federal, state and provincial corporate income
tax rates in effect for the year in which the applicable indemnity payment is
made or (ii) in the case of a Tax credit, 100%. In the case of any Tax
deduction 

 



71  that will be recognized, or any Tax credit that will be utilized, in taxable
years after the year in which the indemnity payment is made, the Tax benefit
shall be discounted using a discount rate equal to 5%.

(d) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the amount, if any, by which (i) the sum of (A) the amount
paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of such
Loss _plus_ (B) the amount received from the third party in respect thereof,
exceeds (ii) the full amount of the Indemnifying Partys portion of such
Loss.

Section 9.9 _Remedies; Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud and as
otherwise provided in Section 10.8, the rights and remedies under this Article
IX are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies that the
Contributor Indemnified Parties may have against SEP or that the SEP
Indemnified Parties may have against SE Corp under this Agreement or otherwise
with respect to the Companies, the Conveyed Interests or any breach of any
representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties expressly waives any and all
other rights, remedies and causes of action it or its Affiliates may have
against the other Party and its respective Affiliates, now or in the future
under any Law with respect to the Transactions. The remedies expressly
provided in this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for
and means of recourse between the Parties with respect to the Transactions.

 

Section 9.10 _Tax Indemnification_. To the extent that SE Corp or SEP may be
liable for indemnification for any Taxes under both Section 6.8 and this
Article IX, SE Corp or SEP, as applicable, shall only be liable under Section
6.8.

Section 10.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Person signatory hereto, or in
the case of a waiver, by the Person against whom the waiver is to
be effective. No failure or delay by any Person in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by Law except as otherwise specifically provided
in Article IX hereof.

 

Section 10.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of SEP and SE Corp and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No Party
may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, no merger or sale of securities 

 



73  of any Party or any entity that directly or indirectly controls any Party
shall constitute an assignment hereunder), without the prior written consent
of the other, except as provided in Section 10.5, and any attempted or
purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.3 shall be null and void;
_provided_ that, after the First Closing, (a) SEP may, in its sole discretion,
without the consent of SE Corp, assign all or a portion of its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of SEP and (b) SE Corp may,
without the consent of SEP, assign all or a portion of its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate;  _provided_ that, in either
case, (i) such assignment shall not relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder, (ii) such assignment shall not have any adverse tax
consequence to the non-assigning party or parties and (iii) the assigning
Person shall within ten Business Days of such assignment notify all parties to
this Agreement about such assignment, including providing copies of the
documentation pursuant to which such assignment was effectuated. From
and after the First Closing, each Person that is an Indemnified Party but not
a party to this Agreement, shall be an express third-party beneficiary of
Article 9. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits), and the other Transaction Documents contain the entire agreement
among SE Corp and SEP with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to such matters.

 

Section 10.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Person
signatory hereto to any other Person signatory hereto under this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents that is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Person signatory hereto shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such
Person signatory hereto. Each party to each of the Transaction Documents
shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to perform all actions, agreements
and obligations set forth herein or therein requiring the performance of any
such Subsidiary or Affiliate (including any entity that becomes a Subsidiary
or Affiliate of such party on or after the date hereof).

 

Section 10.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be borne by the Person signatory hereto incurring such costs and expenses.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum;
Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws rules
thereof (other than New York General Obligations Law Sections 5-1401 and
5-1402).

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all actions, suits or
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the other
Transaction 

 



74  Documents or the consummation of the Transactions shall be heard and
determined exclusively in United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
of The City of New York; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court
does not have jurisdiction over such action, suit or proceeding, such action,
suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in any state
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent
with the preceding sentence, each of SE Corp and SEP hereby, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates from time to time, (i) irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or New York state court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
of the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the Transactions
brought by any of them, (ii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by
way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or the Transactions may
not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts and (iii) irrevocably
consents to and grants any such court exclusive jurisdiction over the person
of such parties and over the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding
and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.1 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HEREBY (I) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHERS HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION
10.7(C).

 

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that its
obligations hereunder are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary
damages, will be inadequate in the event it should default in the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any
breach of any agreement, representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement, a Party, in the case of a breach by the other Party, shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
to prevent breaches of this

 



75  Agreement and to order the defaulting Party to affirmatively carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, and each of the Parties hereby waives any
defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for
such breach. Such equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which each of the Parties are entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for
such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. Each of the Parties hereby
waives any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such
equitable remedy. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be or construed as a
waiver or election of remedies by any of the Parties, each of whom
expressly reserves any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or
in equity in the event of any breach or default by the others under this
Agreement prior to the Closing on or before which the relevant obligation is
required to be performed. 

Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. Except with respect to any Supplemental
Disclosure, which is governed by Section 6.5, the disclosure of any matter in
any section or subsection of the SE Corp Disclosure Schedule or the SEP
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), as
applicable, shall be deemed to be a disclosure under the respective Persons
Disclosure Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement to which such matter
could reasonably be expected to be pertinent. The mere inclusion of any item
in any section or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules, as an
exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise shall not be deemed
to constitute an admission by any of the Parties, as applicable, or to
otherwise imply, that any such item has had or is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise
represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the
purposes of this Agreement, that such item meets or exceeds a monetary or
other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement or that such item
represents a determination that the Transactions require the consent of any
third party. The sections or subsections of each Disclosure Schedule are
arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections of this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section or subsection
of any of the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters that
are required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or obligation to
disclose any information beyond what is required by this Agreement, and
disclosure of such additional matters shall not affect, directly or
indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the
disclosure obligations hereunder. To the extent cross-references are set forth
in any section or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such cross-
references are intended solely for convenience and are by no means intended as
a statement of limitation as to where disclosure is relevant or appropriate.
The reference to any Contract or other documents or materials in any section
or subsection of any of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference, for all purposes set forth in this Section 10.9 and
the remainder of this Agreement, all terms and conditions of, and schedules
and annexes to, such Contract or other document to the extent made available,
prior to the date of this Agreement, to SEP and its Representatives or SE Corp
and its Representatives, as applicable. Headings inserted in the sections or
subsections of any of the Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of
reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or changing
the express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in this
Agreement.

 



76 Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this
Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Section 10.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not
be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.13 _Action by SEP_. With respect to any action (including any case
where the agreement of, or selection by, SEP is required), notice, consent,
approval or waiver that is required to be taken or given or that may be taken
or given by SEP at any time (including after the Closings) with respect to, or
in connection with, the subject matter hereof, such action, notice, consent,
approval or waiver shall be taken or given by the Conflicts Committee on
behalf of SEP.

FORM OF FIRPTA CERTIFICATE

CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold
tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
Section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal
title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be treated as
the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform
Spectra Energy Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "
_Transferee_ "), that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition
of any U.S. real property interests by [ ], a Delaware [
] (the " _Transferor_ "), the undersigned hereby certifies to Transferee the
following on behalf of the Transferor. 

1\. The Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder);

2\. The Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

3\. The Transferors employer identification number is [ ]; and

4\. The Transferors office address is [5400 Westheimer Court, Houston, Texas
77056].

The Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to
the Internal Revenue Service by the Transferee and that any false statement
contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Under penalties of perjury, the undersigned declares that he/she has examined
this certification and to the best of his/her knowledge and belief it is true,
correct and complete, and he/she further declares that he/she has authority
to sign this document on behalf of the Transferor.

SECONDMENT

 

 _Section 2.1_ Seconded Employees.

__The electronic record of all active Employing Entities  employees,
maintained by the Employing Entities Human Resources Department in the
electronic database known as the Human Resources Information System (the "
_Seconded Employee Schedule_ "), sets forth a true, complete and accurate list
of each employee (each such employee and each other employee who is
subsequently seconded to SEP in accordance with this Agreement, a " _Seconded
Employee_ " and __

 



-3-  _ _ collectively, the " _Seconded Employees_ ") who, beginning on the
Effective Date or the date after the Effective Date on which the Seconded
Employee is seconded, and when they are performing duties at SEP assets or
facilities or are otherwise working on behalf of SEP, and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, Employing Entities agree to second to SEP, and SEP agrees
to accept such secondment (the " _Secondment_ "). __

__The Seconded Employees will remain at all times employees of Employing
Entities, but, in addition, when they are performing duties at SEP assets or
facilities or are otherwise working on behalf of SEP then they will also be
joint employees of SEP during the Period of Secondment (as defined below).
Those active employees whose titles in the Human Resources Information System
reflect that they serve as supervisors or managers and who are called upon to
oversee the work of Seconded Employees working at SEP assets or facilities or
to provide management support on behalf of SEP are designated by SEP as
supervisors (each, a " _SEP Supervisor_ ," and collectively, " _SEP
Supervisors_ ,") to act on the behalf of SEP in supervising the Seconded
Employees pursuant to Section 2.4. Any Seconded Employee so designated will
be acting on the behalf of SEP when supervising the work of the Seconded
Employees or when they are otherwise providing management or executive support
on behalf of SEP. _ _

__Employing Entities retain the right to hire or discharge the Seconded
Employees with respect to their employment with Employing Entities. For each
Seconded Employee, the " _Period of Secondment_ " shall be that period of time
as set forth in _Section 2.2_. Subject to _Section 2.3_, individuals may be
added to or removed from the Seconded Employee Schedule from time to time by
the addition or deletion of such persons in the electronic record of all
active Employing Entities employees, supervisors, managers and executives,
maintained by the Employing Entities Human Resources Department in the
electronic database known as the Human Resources Information System, when they
are ceasing employment, when they are starting employment, or are performing
duties at SEP assets or facilities or are otherwise working on behalf of SEP,
which will be fully binding on the Parties for all purposes under this
Agreement. __

_Section 2.2_ Period of Secondment.

Employing Entities will second to SEP each Seconded Employee on the Effective
Date, as described with respect to the Seconded Employee Schedule, and
continue to second, during the period that the Seconded Employee is performing
services for SEP, until the earliest of: 

(a) the end of the term of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1_;

 

(b) a resignation or termination of employment with respect to such Seconded
Employee; or

 

(c) a termination of Secondment for such Seconded Employee by SEP under
_Section 2.3_.

 

At the end of the Period of Secondment for any Seconded Employee, such
Seconded Employee will no longer be subject to the supervision of SEP with
regard to the Seconded Employees day-to-day activities pursuant to Section
2.4 unless such individual thereafter otherwise becomes employed by SEP.

 



-4-  _Section 2.3_ Termination of Secondment.

 

 __SEP will have the right to terminate the Secondment to it of any Seconded
Employee for any reason at any time, upon prior written notice to Employing
Entities (such terminated Seconded Employees are referred to as " _Removed
Employees_ "). Upon the termination of a Secondment, the Seconded Employee
will cease performing services for SEP. At no time will SEP have the right to
terminate the employment with Employing Entities of the Seconded Employees.
Employing Entities shall in their sole discretion determine whether the
employment by Employing Entities of any such Removed Employee shall
be terminated following the termination of such Removed Employees Secondment
or whether such Removed Employee shall be redeployed by Employing Entities.
SEP shall be responsible for any severance or other benefits accruing to any
Removed Employee not redeployed by Employing Entities to the extent the
services of such Removed Employee related to SEP and its assets and
businesses. __

_Section 2.4_ Supervision.

In the course and scope of performing any Seconded Employees job functions
for SEP, the Seconded Employee will report into SEPs management structure,
and will be under the direct management and supervision of SEP with respect to
such Seconded Employees day-to-day activities, provided however that the
Employing Entities shall have final authority to direct, supervise, and
control the Seconded Employees.

_Section 2.5_ Seconded Employee Qualifications.

Employing Entities will, consistent with past practice and Employing
Entities hiring processes and qualifications in effect from time to time,
provide suitably qualified and experienced Seconded Employees. Employing
Entities do not warrant that the Secondment of the Seconded Employees will
permit SEP to achieve any specific results.

_Section 2.6_ Benefit Plan Participation.

SEP shall not be a participating employer in any Benefit Plan during the
Period of Secondment. Employing Entities and their Affiliates (other than
SEP) shall remain solely responsible for all obligations and liabilities
arising with respect to the Benefit Plans, and during the Period of
Secondment, SEP shall not assume any Benefit Plan or have any obligations or
liabilities arising thereunder, in each case except for costs properly
chargeable to SEP and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership Agreement and the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (as such
term is defined in that certain Contribution Agreement between Spectra Energy
Corp and SEP LP dated as of August 5, 2013).

ARTICLE III.

SEP EMPLOYEE SERVICES

_Section 3.1_ SEP Employee Services.

Those services provided to SEP by the Seconded Employees shall be referred to
herein as the " _SEP Employee Services_."

 



-5-  _Section 3.2_ Cancellation of SEP Employee Services.

 

SEP may terminate any of SEP Employee Services on 30 days prior written
notice to Employing Entities. In the event SEP terminates SEP Employee
Services, SEP shall pay Employing Entities the monthly installment for the
last month (or portion thereof) in which it received such terminated services,
and shall also include any accrued benefits that might be triggered or become
due and payable for such Seconded Employees to the extent the services of
such Seconded Employees related to SEP and its assets and businesses. Upon
payment thereof, SEP shall have no further services payment obligations to
Employing Entities pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such terminated
services.

_Section 3.3_ Workers Compensation. 

During the Period of Secondment, Employing Entities will maintain workers
compensation and employers liability insurance (either through an insurance
company or qualified self-insured program) which shall include and afford
coverage to the Seconded Employees including during when they are under
Secondment. Employing Entities will name SEP as a named insured under such
insurance policies or qualified self-insured programs. Subject to _Article IV_
, Employing Entities will use the Services Reimbursement paid by SEP to pay an
appropriate and commensurate amount of the workers compensation
and employers liability insurance premiums for SEPs purposes, using a form
or pro-ration methodology based on salaries and loading allocated to SEP, to
be defined and agreed to between SEP and Employing Entities, and Employing
Entities will pay from its own funds the balance of the amount due of such
insurance premiums for Employing Entities purposes. The Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure general liability insurance that
does not include exclusions for claims by employees. For the purposes of
workers compensation and employers liability laws and coverage, Employing
Entities and SEP will be joint employers of the Seconded Employees. Each
Seconded Employee is to acknowledge that the Seconded Employee, when under
Secondment, is an employee of both Employing Entities and SEP and that for any
work place injury, the Seconded Employees sole remedy against either
Employing Entities or SEP will be under the workers compensation insurance
policy or qualified self-insured program of Employing Entities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude a Seconded
Employee from participating in benefit programs generally available to
employees of Employing Entities. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement has any effect on the right of a Seconded Employee to prosecute a
workers compensation claim against Employing Entities, SEP, or both.

 

 _Section 3.4_ Statutory Employer Relationship

The Parties acknowledge that the services provided for under this Agreement
are an integral part of and essential to the ability of SEP to generate the
goods, products, and services of SEP, and to enable SEP to fulfill its
business and commercial contracts, which are the core of its business. SEP
agrees to execute work that is part of its trade, business, and occupation.
The Parties expressly recognize SEP as the statutory employer of
Employing Entities employees for workers compensation purposes, whether
those employees be direct employees or statutory employees of Employing
Entities.

 



-6-  ARTICLE IV.

SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT

_Section 4.1_ Expense Reimbursement.

__SEP shall periodically reimburse Employing Entities upon request (in a form
mutually agreed upon by SEP and Employing Entities) for all reimbursable
expenses under _Section 4.2_ incurred by Employing Entities with respect to
the Seconded Employees (including, where applicable, former Seconded
Employees) in connection with the performance of SEP Employee Services during
the preceding period (the " _Services Reimbursement_ "). __

_Section 4.2_ Seconded Employees Expenses.

__The costs and expenses described in the preceding sentence are referred to
as " _Seconded Employee Expenses_." Where it is not reasonably practicable to
determine the amount of such a cost or expense, SEP and Employing Entities
shall mutually agree on the method of determining or estimating such cost or
expense. __

 



-7-  ARTICLE V.

PAYMENT

_Section 5.1_ Payment.

 

SEP and Employing Entities acknowledge and agree that Employing Entities shall
be responsible for paying the Seconded Employee Expenses (or providing the
employee benefits with respect thereto, as applicable) to the Seconded
