Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of (i) paying directly or reimbursing the Equityholders&rsquo; Representative for any
third-party expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Engagement Agreement and any agreement ancillary hereto
and (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Equityholders&rsquo; Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Equityholders&rsquo; Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith. The Equityholders&rsquo; Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Equityholders&rsquo; Representative
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting
or income distribution obligations. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following
the reasonable determination by the Equityholders&rsquo; Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld,
the Equityholders&rsquo; Representative shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the amount remaining in the Expense Fund to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Equityholders in accordance with the allocations provided in Section 1.13(b), <I>provided</I>,
that Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Equityholders&rsquo; Representative to facilitate the payment of any portion of
such payment that is payable to Company Optionholders who are current or former employees and subject to Tax withholding through

shall not include any consideration received with respect to a sale, use or other disposition of any Company Product in a country

so sold, used or disposed of. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amounts invoiced for the sale of Company Products by (a) Parent,

or its Affiliates among such Milestone Obligor or its Affiliates, as applicable, for resale shall not be included in the computation
of Net Sales hereunder and Net Sales shall be the gross invoice or contract price charged to the Third Party customer for that
Company Product in an arms&rsquo; length transaction, less the Permitted Deductions. With respect to any sale of a Company Product
in a given country other than in an arm&rsquo;s length transaction, for purposes of calculating Net Sales under this Agreement,
such Company Product will be deemed to have been sold at the average Net Sales price charged to Third Parties for sales in such
country in arms&rsquo; length transactions during the applicable calendar quarter (or if there were no such sales in such country
during such calendar quarter, at the fair market value as determined by comparable markets). All of the foregoing elements of Net
Sales calculations shall be determined in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the calculation. In the event that
a Company Product is sold as a fixed dose or co-packaged combination with other therapeutically active pharmaceutical compound(s)
at a single price (a &ldquo;<B><I>Combination Product</I></B>&rdquo;), Net Sales from the sale of such Combination Product will
be calculated for each applicable calendar quarter by multiplying the Net Sales (as determined without reference to this paragraph)
of such Combination Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where (i) A is the average gross selling price in the applicable country of
the Company Product and (ii) B is the average gross selling price in the applicable country of the other therapeutically active
pharmaceutical compound(s) included in such Combination Product, each when sold separately in finished form, during the applicable
calendar quarter or, if sales of the Combination Product and the separate product(s) did not occur during such calendar quarter,
the most recent calendar quarter in which sales of such products occurred. In the event that the average gross selling price(s)
cannot be determined for A or B, the Net Sales attributable to the Company Product shall be reasonably allocated between A and
B based on their relative fair market values.</P>
