the Company Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares, as
applicable, represented by such Company Share Certificate and (ii) Parent
shall issue or caused to be issued (which may be in book entry form) to such

ownership of the right to the consideration set forth in Section 1.5 such
Company Shares shall have been converted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

(e) In the event any Company Share Certificate representing Company
Shares converted in connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 1.5 shall
have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion
or as required by the Paying Agent and as a condition precedent to the
payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares
previously represented by such Company Share Certificate, require the owner
of such lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Company Share Certificate to
provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such amount, form
and with such surety as the Paying Agent customarily requires) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Share Certificate.

  



  

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Share Certificate with respect to the
Company Shares represented thereby, until such holder surrenders such Company
Share Certificate, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at
which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and
distributions).

  



  

(g) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Shares for any Parent
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash
amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable

each Equityholder under this Agreement, including for purposes of calculating
their respective portions of distributions from amounts placed in escrow
under this Agreement and the Expense Fund (i) the consideration payable in
respect of Company Shares held by each such Non-Dissenting Stockholder shall
be calculated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (ii) the consideration
payable in respect of Company Options shall be calculated on a grant-by-grant
basis, (iii) the amount of cash to be paid shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole cent on an Equityholder-by-Equityholder basis, and (iv) the
number of Parent Shares to be issued shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number on an Equityholder-by-Equityholder basis. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which such Non-Dissenting Stockholder would otherwise be
entitled, after combining any fractional interests of such Non-Dissenting
Stockholder into as many whole shares as is possible, such Non-Dissenting
Stockholder shall be paid in cash an amount equal to the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the Parent
Stock Price by the fraction of a Parent Share that would otherwise be
deliverable to such Non-Dissenting Stockholder under this Section 1.9.

Section 1.10 _Escrow and Expense Fund_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall issue, or shall cause the issuance of (which may be in book
entry form) the Initial Escrow Shares in the name of Wilmington Trust N.A., as
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent as
collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnified Parties under Article VIII
(such escrow fund, the " _General Escrow Fund_ "). If any Milestone Payment
becomes due and payable (A) prior to the expiration of the First Escrow
Period, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of such Milestone Payment or (B)
following the expiration of the First Escrow Period and prior to the date
that is twelve months following the Closing Date, an amount equal to five
percent (5%) of such Milestone Payment, shall not be paid to the
Equityholders and shall instead be deposited with the Escrow Agent in the
General Escrow Fund (such amounts, the " _Milestone General Escrow Property_
"), which amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (and such deposited amount shall constitute a portion of the
General Escrow Property). Parent shall deposit the Milestone General Escrow
Property with the Escrow Agent at the same time that Parent is required to
deliver the related Milestone Payment to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section
1.13. The Parent Shares deposited in the General Escrow Fund pursuant to this
Section 1.10(a), together with the Milestone General Escrow Property, is
referred to, collectively, as the " _General Escrow Property_."

  



  

(b) In accordance with Article IX, Parent shall withhold from the
Initial Cash Amount $100,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ ") and, within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit the Expense
Fund with the Equityholders' Representative, _provided_ , that the
Equityholders' Representative has provided written instructions to Parent on
or prior to the Closing with respect to such deposit.

  



  

(c) If any Milestone Payment becomes due and payable prior to the
Designated Survival Date, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of such
Milestone Payment (the " _Designated Escrow Property_ "), shall not be paid to
the Equityholders and shall instead be deposited with the Escrow Agent. The
Designated Escrow Property shall be held by the Escrow Agent in a
separate escrow account from the General Escrow Fund and shall be held as
collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnified Parties under Article VIII
with respect to the Designated Indemnification Matters (such escrow fund, the
" _Designated Escrow Fund_ "). Parent shall deposit the Designated Escrow
Property with the Escrow Agent at the same time that Parent is required to
deliver the related Milestone Payment to the Paying Agent.

  



    

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Subject to any reduction pursuant to Section 8.4, the General
Escrow Property and the Designated Escrow Property shall each be held
in segregated accounts by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the provisions of an
escrow agreement which each of Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall enter into on or prior to the Closing Date
substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

(e) Fifty percent (50%) of the General Escrow Property (the " _First-
Half Escrow Property_ "), less the amount of the First-Half Escrow Property
distributed by the Escrow Agent to Parent, Sorrento or other Indemnified
Parties pursuant to the Escrow Agreement on or prior to the date that is six
(6) months after the Closing Date (the " _First Escrow Period_ "), shall be
released and paid to the Equityholders by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the allocations provided in Section 1.13(b), on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the end of the First Escrow Period (the " _First Escrow Release
Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Indemnified Party
has made any claims for indemnification prior to the expiration of the First
Escrow Period in accordance with Section 8.3 that are unresolved or resolved
but yet to be satisfied (each, an " _Unresolved Claim_ " and each such claim
to the extent made with respect to a Designated Indemnification Matter, an "
_Unresolved Designated Claim_ "), to the extent funds are available in the
General Escrow Fund to satisfy such Unresolved Claim as of the end of the
First Escrow Period, then, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will, pursuant to
written instructions delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent, with a copy
delivered to the Equityholders' Representative, prior to the First Escrow
Release Date, continue to hold an amount of the remaining First-Half Escrow
Property that Parent reasonably expects to be necessary to satisfy such
Unresolved Claims.

  



  

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (such twelve (12) month period
after the Closing Date, the " _Final Escrow Period_ "), any General Escrow
Property not previously released by the Escrow Agent as of such date shall be
released and paid to the Equityholders by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the allocations provided in Section 1.13(b) on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the end of the Final Escrow Period (the " _Final Escrow Release
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Indemnified
Party has made any Unresolved Claims as of the end of the Final Escrow
Period, then, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will, pursuant to written instructions
delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent, with a copy delivered to the
Equityholders' Representative, prior to the Final Escrow Release Date,
continue to hold an amount of General Escrow Property that Parent reasonably
expects to be necessary to satisfy such Unresolved Claims.

  



  

(g) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date on which Parent is required to deposit an
applicable portion of the Designated Escrow Property with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Section 1.10 (such twelve (12) month period after such date,
a " _Designated Escrow Period_ "), any such Designated Escrow Property not
previously released by the Escrow Agent as of such date shall be released and
paid to the Equityholders by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
allocations provided in Section 1.13(b) on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the end of the applicable Designated Escrow Period (a " _Designated
Escrow Release Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any
Indemnified Party has made any Unresolved Designated Claim as of the end of
such Designated Escrow Period, then, in accordance with and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will, pursuant
to written instructions delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent, with a copy
delivered to the Equityholders' Representative, prior to the applicable
Designated Escrow Release Date, continue to hold an amount of Designated
Escrow Property that Parent reasonably expects to be necessary to satisfy
such Unresolved Designated Claims. For purposes of this Section 1.10, payments
and distributions made from the Designated Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be
made from the earliest available despot of the Designated Escrow
Property into the Designated Escrow Fund.

(h) In the event that this Agreement and the Merger are adopted and
approved by the Stockholders constituting the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, then all Equityholders shall, without any further act of
any Stockholder, be deemed to have consented to and approved (i) the use of
the General Escrow Property as collateral to secure the indemnification rights
of the Indemnified Parties under Article VIII and the use of the Designated
Escrow Property as collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnified Parties
under Article VIII with respect to the Designated Indemnification Matters, in
each case, in the manner set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement and
(ii) the application of the Expense Fund for use by the Equityholders'
Representative in accordance with Section 9.1(h).

  



  

Section 1.11 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Shares held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such demand
for appraisal of such holder's Company Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL and/or, if applicable by virtue of Section 2115 of the CCC,
Chapter 1300 _et. seq._ of the CCC, and as of the Closing has neither
effectively withdrawn nor lost such holder's right to such appraisal (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration, in accordance with Section 1.5, but shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL or the CCC. Parent
shall be entitled to retain any Merger Consideration not paid on account of
such Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of such holders, and
the holder of any Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to any
portion thereof.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.11(a), if any holder of
Company Shares who demands appraisal of such holder's shares under the DGCL
or the CCC, as applicable, shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's right to appraisal, then, as
of the Closing or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such
holder's Company Shares shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive, promptly following the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such Company Shares, the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 1.5.

  



  

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of any
demands for appraisal of Company Shares received by the Company,
withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL or the CCC, as applicable, and received by the Company; and (ii) the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations, petitions and proceedings
with respect to any such demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent (which may be given or withheld in
Parent's sole discretion), make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing, other than by operation of law or pursuant to a
final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 1.12 _Stock Options_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and that has not been exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto:

  



  

(i) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (i) the aggregate number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Underlying Company Shares_ ")  _by_ (ii) the sum of (A) the Per Share Stock
Participation _less_ (B) the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (I) the exercise
price per Underlying Company Share (the " _Option Exercise Price_ ") by (II)
the Parent Stock Price;  _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall such
number of Parent Shares be less than zero (0); _provided, further,_ that the
Option Exercise Price shall be reduced by application of this Section
1.12(a)(i) by the cash value of the Per Share Stock Participation (as
determined based on the Parent Stock Price), with any positive remainder of
the Option Exercise Price after such reduction being referred to herein as
the " _Remaining Exercise Price_ ";

  



  

(ii) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_
(i) the Underlying Company Shares by (ii) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash
Participation _less_ (B) the Remaining Exercise Price per Underlying Company
Share (if any) following the application of Section 1.12(a)(i); and

  



  

(iii) an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_
(i) the Underlying Company Shares _by_ (ii) the sum of (A) the Contingent Per
Share Participation Cash _plus_ (B) the Contingent Per Common Share Cash
_plus_ (C) the Contingent Per Share Cash, if and when payable (such amount,
an " _Option Contingent Payment_ "). The parties agree that any payment of
the Option Contingent Payment, if any, payable with respect to Company Options
will be treated and reported for all tax purposes as being subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) until such amounts become due and payable
under the Agreement and shall be paid to the holders of Company Options
entitled to such payments within the short-term deferral period within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company's board of directors
shall adopt appropriate resolutions, and take all other actions necessary
(including, but not limited to, obtaining the written consent of each Company
Optionholder regarding the treatment of Company Options set forth in this
Section 1.12), to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.12. As a
condition to the right of a holder of Company Options to receive the
consideration set forth in this Section 1.12, such holder shall have executed
and delivered to Parent (i) a consent in a form reasonably requested by
Parent, consenting to and acknowledging the treatment of the Company Options
as set forth in Section 1.12 (the " _Company Option Consent_ "), (ii) with
respect to any holder of Company Options holding greater than one-fourth of
one percent (0.25%) of the Fully Diluted Capital Number, a Joinder Agreement,

Section 1.13 _Milestone Payments_.

  



  

(a) Following the occurrence (or deemed occurrence pursuant to the
definitions in Annex A) of any of the events set forth in Annex A under
"Milestone Event" (each a " _Milestone_ "), whether achieved by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees or any Milestone Obligor,
Parent shall, within thirty (30) Business Days following each such event,
deposit or cause to be deposited the amount of cash in U.S. dollars set forth
in Annex A under "Milestone Payment" opposite such Milestone (each, a "
_Milestone Payment_ ") to an account designated in writing by the Paying
Agent. The Equityholders Representative shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
such amount to the Equityholders in accordance with Section 1.5 and Section
1.12, in each case subject to any right of set-off pursuant to Section 8.6 and
less (i) any withholding on such amount by Parent pursuant to Section 1.8(g)
and (ii) the portion of such amount, if any, that would otherwise be paid
with respect to Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Milestone
Payments shall be subject to withholding for the escrow provisions set forth
in Section 1.10. Each of the Milestone Payments shall be payable one (1)
time only on the initial achievement of the applicable Milestone. The maximum
aggregate amount of Milestone Payments that may be payable by Parent is
$280,000,000. Once a Milestone Payment has been paid as directed by the
Equityholders' Representative pursuant to this Section 1.13(a), Parent shall
have no further obligations to any Person, including, without limitation, the
Equityholders, with respect to the portion of the Milestone Payment so paid,
other than to reasonably cooperate with the Equityholders' Representative to
process and pay, through its or its Affiliate's payroll system, any portion of
such Milestone Payment that constitutes an Option Contingent Payment payable
to Company Optionholders who are current or former employees and subject to
Tax withholding, and to perform its obligations pursuant to Section 8.6.

  



  

(b) Each Milestone Payment as well as each distribution to the
Equityholders from the General Escrow Fund and Designated Escrow Fund,
and from the Expense Fund, shall be allocated under Section 1.5 (after taking
into account any amounts previously made pursuant to Section 1.5(c)(i),
Section 1.5(c)(ii), Section 1.5(c)(iii), Section 1.5(c)(iv), Section 1.5(d)(i)
and Section 1.5(d)(ii)) among the Equityholders as follows:

  



  

(i) first, to the Equityholders allocated on a pro rata basis among the
Equityholders based their owned Company Securities as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time until each holder of Company Preferred Stock outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time has received pursuant to Section
1.5 (without allocating to the Equityholders any amounts deposited in the
General Escrow Fund or the Designated Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund) an
amount equal to $2.86 per share of Company Preferred Stock (the "
_Preferred Cap_ ");

  



    

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) second, once the Preferred Cap has been satisfied, to the holders
of Company Common Shares and Company Optionholders outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time allocated on a pro rata basis
among such holders based on their owned Company Common Shares and Company
Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time until each holder of
Company Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time has received pursuant to Section 1.5 (without allocating to the
Equityholders any amounts deposited in the General Escrow Fund or the
Designated Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund) an amount equal to $2.86 per
Company Common Shares (the " _Common Catch-Up_ "); and

  



  

(iii) third, once the Common Catch-Up has been satisfied, to the
Equityholders allocated on a pro rata basis among the Equityholders based
on their owned Company Securities as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, if any portion of a Milestone Payment is subject
to a setoff pursuant to Section 8.6, then the foregoing shall apply to the
portion of the Milestone Payment as they are paid to the Equityholders.

  



  

(c) Parent shall (i) on the first (1st) Business Day following the
Closing, make an amount of cash available to the Surviving Corporation equal
to $3,500,000 and (ii) following the Closing, use its Diligent Efforts to
assist the Surviving Corporation in obtaining funding necessary to enable the
Surviving Corporation to cause the Milestones to occur. " _Diligent Efforts_ "
shall mean the level of efforts required to carry out such obligation in a
sustained manner consistent with the efforts a similarly
situated biopharmaceutical company typically devotes to products of similar
market potential, project potential or strategic value, based on conditions
then prevailing.

  



  

(d) The right of the Equityholders to receive the Milestone Payments
(i) is solely a contractual right and will not be evidenced by a
certificate, does not constitute a security, or other instrument, (ii) may
not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other
manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, except by will or
intestacy, by operation of law, (iii) does not represent any equity or
ownership interest in Parent or in any constituent company to the Merger or
any of their respective Affiliates, (iv) does not give the Equityholders any
right to receive interest payments and (v) shall (together with any Milestone
Payments actually made) be treated by the parties as consideration in respect
of Company Shares or Company Options, as applicable, for applicable income
tax purposes, except for any amount required by Law to be treated as interest.
Without limiting the obligations of Parent under this Section 1.13 (including
the obligations to pay the Milestone Payments when due), there is no guaranty
or other assurance of any kind that any Milestone Payments will become
payable hereunder (regardless of any projections, models forecasts or any
other financial data generated by, or provided to, the Company, the
Equityholders, Parent or their respective representatives).

  



  

(e) Commencing upon the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates and each Milestone
Obligor to use Diligent Efforts to cause each Milestone to be achieved.

  



    

 | -14-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Following the Closing, for so long as a Milestone Payment may
become payable hereunder, Parent shall cause to be delivered a status
update to the Equityholders' Representative within thirty (30) days following
each anniversary of the Closing Date (each such report, an " _Update Report_
"). Parent shall cause each Update Report to include a reasonably detailed
outline of the status of efforts to cause the occurrence of each outstanding
Milestone during the period covered by such Update Report and, commencing
upon the first commercial sale of the first Company Product, the cumulative
Net Sales of each Company Product.

  



  

(i) All information contained in any Update Report, or conveyed to the
Equityholders' Representative in any meeting or other communication regarding
an Update Report, shall be subject to a confidentiality agreement to be
entered into by Parent and the Equityholders' Representative in customary
form as reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Equityholders' Representative.
The Equityholders' Representative shall not disclose any information included
in any such Update Report except as permitted in such
confidentiality agreement and except to Equityholders and any limited
partners of such Equityholders who have executed a confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality provisions with respect to any
information provided with respect hereto that are no less protective than the
provisions contained in the confidentiality agreement referred to in the
preceding sentence, and the Equityholders' Representative shall cause Parent
to be named as third-party beneficiaries of such provisions with the right to
enforce such provisions.

  



  

(ii) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Update Report, if the
Equityholders' Representative in good faith requests a meeting with
representatives of Parent to discuss such report, Parent shall make reasonably
available during normal business hours for such a meeting at least one (1)
employee with operating responsibility for the activities (whether at Parent
or the Surviving Corporation) and related to the development, regulatory and
other activities for the Company Product(s). The Equityholders'
Representative may not request more than one (1) such meeting in respect of
any Update Report.

  



  

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, during the period commencing on the
first sale of a Company Product anywhere in the world and continuing until
the earlier of (i) receipt by the Equityholders of all Milestone Payments, and
(ii) the third anniversary of the cessation of all sales of all Company
Products, Parent and its Affiliates (each, an " _Audited Party_ ") shall,
once during any fiscal year, permit an accountant appointed by the
Equityholders' Representative, and reasonably acceptable to Parent, at
reasonable times during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
examine such books and records as may be necessary for the purpose of
verifying the calculation of the Net Sales of Company Products during the
period covered by the applicable audit. The accountant shall disclose to the
Equityholders' Representative and to Parent, based on its inspection of the
applicable records, whether such Net Sales have been accurately calculated,
and if not, the amount and nature of any discrepancy discovered. The
accountant shall disclose no other information revealed in such audit, and
Parent may require such accountant to enter into a reasonable and customary
confidentiality agreement with respect to the records examined by such
accountant. The Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders) shall pay for any such audit pursuant to Section 9.1(d).

(h) Prior to any Milestone Obligor obtaining any rights to develop,
seek Marketing Approval for and/or commercialize any, Company
Product (collectively, a " _Milestone Right_ "), Parent shall (and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and their affiliates to) comply with this
Section 1.13(h).

  



  

(i) _Significant Pharmaceutical Companies_.

  



  

(1) Prior, and as a condition to, transferring any Milestone Rights to
a Milestone Obligor that is a Significant Pharmaceutical Company,
Parent shall (A) enter into a written agreement with such Milestone Obligor
expressly providing as follows (such agreement, an " _Assumption Agreement_
"): (w) that the Significant Pharmaceutical Company assumes and agrees to be
bound by and perform all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement that apply to, relate to or with respect to,
the Milestones and Milestone Payments set forth in Sections 1.5, Section
1.13, Article X and Annex A hereto (collectively, the "
_Milestone Provisions_ ") and provides that all references to Parent, Merger
Sub and Surviving Corporation set forth in the Milestone Provisions that
apply to, relate to or are with respect to the Milestones or Milestone
Payments shall be deemed to be references to such Significant Pharmaceutical
Company, (x) specifically provides that upon the execution of the Assumption
Agreement, the Significant Pharmaceutical Company will obtain all of the
right, title and interest of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
each Milestone Obligor and their Affiliates to develop, seek Marketing
Approval for and/or commercialize the Company Products (collectively, the "
_Total Milestone Rights_ "), (y) provides that any Net Sales previously made
by Parent, a Sublicensee or other Milestone Obligor shall be included in the
Net Sales made by such Significant Pharmaceutical Company for purposes of
calculating the Milestones related to Net Sales, and (z) provides that the
Equityholders' Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, will be an
express third party beneficiary of such Assumption Agreement and that the
Equityholders' Representative will be able to enforce, and seek claims
against the Significant Pharmaceutical Company with respect to the Milestones
and Milestone Payments to the same extent the Equityholders' Representative
could against Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement, and
(B) provide the Equityholders' Representative (on no less than ten (10)
Business Days' notice) the opportunity to review and countersign the
Assumption Agreement (it being understood that if the Equityholders'
Representative determines not to countersign the Assumption Agreement, it
will still have the rights required to be set forth in the Assumption
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing).

  



  

(2) If Parent complies with the terms of this Section 1.13(h) and the
Significant Pharmaceutical Company and Parent enter into an
Assumption Agreement (and the assignment and assumption contemplated thereby
is consummated) that complies with the terms in Section
1.13(h)(i)(1) (including that all of the Total Milestone Rights are assigned
and transferred to the Significant Pharmaceutical Company), then Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be fully and forever released with respect to,
and the Equityholders shall look solely to such Significant Pharmaceutical
Company for the performance of, the obligations of Parent to achieve the
Milestones and make the Milestone Payments pursuant to the Milestone
Provisions that were not payable at such time; _provided_ , _however_  that

distribution to the Equityholders) under this Section 4.1(b) shall be net of
(1) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such refund of
Taxes, (2) any Tax required to be withheld on such payment, and (3) any Taxes
actually imposed on Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation as a result of
such refunds.

not cause or permit the Company to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) initiate requests for voluntary
disclosure relief with one or more Governmental Body relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (iii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect

Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Tax Periods. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other party's request, cost and expense) the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees or agents
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided under this Section 4.1(d).

  



  

(e) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing, Parent and the Company shall
promptly inform the Equityholders Representative in writing of
the commencement of any claim, audit, investigation, examination, or other
proceeding relating in whole or in part to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
for which any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification from the
Equityholders under this Agreement (" _Tax Contest_ "). After the Closing
Date, Parent shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of
Company in any and all Tax Contests; _provided, however_ , that the
Equityholders Representative shall have the right to participate in any such
Tax Contest and to employ counsel (at the expense of the Equityholders) of its
choice (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent) for purposes
of such participation. In the event that Parent proposes to compromise or
settle any Tax Contest, or consent or agree to any Tax liability in
connection with a Tax Contest, relating to the Company that would result in an
indemnification obligation by the Equityholders, the Equityholders
Representative shall have the right to review such proposed compromise,
settlement, consent or agreement. Parent shall not agree or consent to
compromise or settle any Tax Contest on a basis that would result in a Tax
liability of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or liability of the
Equityholders for indemnification under this Agreement unless the
Equityholders Representative consents to such settlement, compromise or
concession, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Taxes or recording fees payable as a
result of the purchase and sale of the Company Common Shares or any other
action contemplated by this Agreement (other than any federal, state, local
or foreign Taxes measured by or based upon income or gains imposed upon
Parent) shall be borne equally by (i) the Stockholders on the one hand, and
(ii) Parent, on the other. The parties shall reasonably cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
and other documents regarding Taxes and all transfer, recording, registration
and other fees that become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to
be filed at or prior to the Closing.

  



  

(g) _Termination of Tax Allocation, Indemnity or Sharing
Agreements_. Before or in connection with the Closing, any Tax allocation,
indemnity or sharing agreement between the Company and any other Person shall
be terminated as to the Company on or prior to the Closing Date, and after
the Closing Date neither the Company nor Parent shall have any liability
thereunder.

(h) _Taxes for a Straddle Tax Period_. In the case of any Taxes
that are imposed for a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the number of which is the number of days in
the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended at the end of
the Closing Date.

  



  

(i) _Closing of the Company Tax Year_. The parties acknowledge that
the taxable year of the Company will end for U.S. federal income tax purposes

connection with, and pursuant to the same plan as, the contribution of shares
of capital stock of Scilex to Parent such that one hundred percent (100%) of
such shares of Scilex have been contributed to Parent (the " _Contribution_
") by the stockholders of Scilex. Parent, Merger Sub, Sorrento and the
Company intend that the Contribution, together with the Merger contemplated
herein, will qualify as a transaction governed by Section 351 of the Code.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Legends_. Each book-entry security entitlement

such shares upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or similar event) issued to or held by any Equityholder in
accordance with the terms hereof or the Escrow Agreement shall bear the

BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE

THAT ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

  



    

 | -57-|

This legend shall be removed by Parent from any book-entry security
entitlement evidencing Parent Shares upon delivery by the holder thereof to
Parent of a written request to that effect if at the time of such written
request (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is at that time
in effect with respect to the legended security or (b) the legended security
can be transferred in a transaction in compliance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, and, in the case of (b), upon the request of Parent, the
holder of such Parent Shares (x) executes and delivers a representation
letter that includes customary representations regarding the holding
requirements and whether such holder is an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule
144 under the Securities Act, and/or (y) secures the delivery to Parent of an
opinion by counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
that such security can be freely transferred in a public sale without
registration pursuant to an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and that such transfer will not jeopardize
the exemption or exemptions from registration pursuant to which Parent issued
the Parent Shares.

provisions under the Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect on

Company and such Company Indemnified Parties existing as of the date hereof,

and representatives) under this Section 4.4 shall be in addition to, and not

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company is not making and shall not be construed to have made, and the
Equityholders shall not have any liability or obligation (i) with respect to,
any representation or warranty as to the amount of, or any
Indemnified Party's ability to use after the Closing Date, any net operating
losses, Tax credits, Tax basis or other Tax attribute, (ii) for any Taxes
resulting from any election made under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar
or analogous provision of Tax law) with respect to the Merger, or (iii) for
any Taxes resulting from any action outside the ordinary course of business
and not specifically contemplated by this Agreement taken by the Company or
Parent after the Closing on the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) All Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII shall be reduced by the
net amount of insurance proceeds or other third party recoveries to which any
Indemnified Party actually recovers in respect of any Losses incurred by such
Indemnified Party (net of any costs of recovery and any increased premiums
resulting therefrom). In the event that any such insurance proceeds or other
third party recoveries are actually recovered by an Indemnified Party
subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification
payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds
or other third-party recoveries relate, then such amounts recovered (net of
any costs of recovery and any increased premiums resulting therefrom and up
to the amount first recovered by the Indemnified Parties) shall be paid
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties to the Indemnifying Parties (or,
if such indemnification payments were paid from the General Escrow Fund or the
Designated Escrow Fund and such refund becomes payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2(g) prior to the release of such fund, to the General Escrow Fund
or the Designated Escrow Fund).

  



  

(h) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnified Party be entitled
to indemnification or set-off pursuant to this Article VIII, and "Losses"
shall not include, any special, punitive, exemplary, consequential, or similar
damages, unless such special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar
damages are owed to a non-Affiliated third party.

  



  

(i) To the extent required by applicable Law, Parent shall (and
shall cause each Indemnified Party to) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which may give rise to any Losses in respect of which the Indemnified Party
may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII.

Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

  



  

(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by
a third party that is not an Indemnified Party (including any
Governmental Body) of any complaint, dispute or claim or the commencement of
any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VIII (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall provide
written notice thereof to the Equityholders' Representative (a " _Notice of
Third-Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such complaint, dispute,
claim, audit, investigation action or proceeding; _provided, however_ ,
that the failure to so provide a Notice of Third-Party Claim to the
Equityholders' Representative shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability under this Article VIII with respect to such Third-Party Claim only
if, and only to the extent that, such failure to so provide a Notice of
Third-Party Claim to the Equityholders' Representative materially prejudices
the rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall provide
reasonable cooperation with the Equityholders' Representative in connection
with such the Third-Party Claim, including, in cases in which Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is the Indemnified Party, by providing the
Equityholders' Representative with reasonable access to books, records,
employees and officers (including as witnesses) of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice
from the Equityholders' Representative delivered to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the applicable Notice of Third-Party
Claim acknowledging and agreeing to the Indemnifying Party's obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII in respect of such
Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, including
the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim that (i) affects any
Intellectual Property Rights that the Company owns or has a right to use in
the conduct of its business as currently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted by the Company as of the Closing and by Parent after the Closing,
(ii) is asserted directly by or on behalf of any Person that is a supplier
or a customer of the Company, the Indemnified Party or their Affiliates,
(iii) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates, (iv) involves a finding of any violation of Law or
other wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, the Company or their Affiliates,
(v) relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, or (vi) does not seek only monetary
damages and, in the case of this clause (vi), the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third-
Party Claim would be detrimental to or materially injure the reputation or
future business prospects of the Indemnified Party. In the event, however,
that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim on the terms of this Section 8.3(b) or to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such
thirty (30) day period, or thereafter defaults in continuing to defend the
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right
to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(c) In any Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is being
sought under this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its
own counsel at such party's own expense. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such
Third-Party Claim and there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the Indemnified Party is
advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with
respect to the subject matter of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified
Party may employ separate counsel. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party (as the case may be) shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep
the Equityholders' Representative or Indemnified Party (as the case may be)
reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter, the
defense of which it is maintaining, and to cooperate in good faith with the
other party with respect to the defense of any such matter.

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in Schedule 8.3(d), any
settlement or compromise of any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought under this
Article VIII by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of
the Equityholders' Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Equityholder, such Equityholder), which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall not
be determinative of whether the Indemnified Party has the right to be
indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, or the amount of Losses
recoverable in respect of such matter. An Indemnifying Party may not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought under this Article VIII unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates
from all liability arising out of, or related to, such Third-Party Claim,
(ii) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or
liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and (iii) does not contain any
equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects, restrains or
interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the
Indemnified Party's Affiliates.

  



  

(e) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment
pursuant to this Article VIII with respect to any Loss not involving a Third-
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall send written
notice of such claim to the Equityholders' Representative (and in the event
that recourse is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party,
such Indemnifying Party) (a " _Notice of Direct Claim_ "). Such Notice of
Direct Claim shall specify the basis for such Direct Claim. In the event the
Equityholders' Representative does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such Notice of Direct Claim
that the Equityholders' Representative disputes the Indemnifying Parties'
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII and, if stated in
such Notice of Direct Claim, the amount thereof, the Equityholders'
Representative shall be deemed to have consented to the Direct Claim
solely to the extent that such claim is made against the amounts held in the
General Escrow Fund, the Designated Escrow Fund or satisfied through the
exercise of the setoff rights set forth in Section 8.6. In the event the
Equityholders' Representative (or in the event that recourse is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) has
disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim as provided in this
Section 8.3(e), as promptly as reasonably practicable, such Indemnified Party
and the Equityholders' Representative or Indemnifying Party, as applicable
shall establish the merits and amount of such Direct Claim (by mutual
agreement, litigation or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days
following the final determination of the merits and amount of such Direct
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article VIII, pay to the Indemnified Party in immediately available
funds an amount equal to such Direct Claim as determined pursuant to
this Section 8.3(e); _provided_ that any such foregoing payments (i) if
settled (or deemed consented to) by the Equityholders' Representative, shall
be made exclusively from, and shall not exceed the amount then available in,
the General Escrow Fund, the Designated Escrow Fund or otherwise satisfied
through the exercise of the setoff rights set forth in Section 8.6 and (ii) if
settled by an Indemnifying Parties, any such foregoing payments shall be paid
exclusively by such consenting Indemnifying Parties. If any such dispute
cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of the date the Indemnifying Party
disputes or is deemed to have disputed such Direct Claim, then any
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party may commence an arbitration proceeding
for the purposes of resolving such dispute pursuant to Section 10.5. If a
dispute exists as to the amount of any Direct Claim, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to reasonable legal and other fees paid in asserting
or defending such Direct Claim, as the case may be. This Section 8.3 shall
not apply to any claim with respect to Taxes.

Section 8.4 _Satisfaction of Losses_. In the event any Indemnified
Party shall suffer any Losses for which such Indemnified Party is finally
determined pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to be entitled to
indemnification under this Article VIII (subject to the limitations set forth
herein), such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover such Losses (a)
first, by the reduction of the number of Parent Shares (with each such
Initial Escrow Share being valued at the Parent Stock Price) and amount of
cash being held as General Escrow Property pursuant to Section 1.10 and the
Escrow Agreement until no General Escrow Property remains, (b) second, with
respect to (i) Designated Indemnification Matters, and (ii) the General
Indemnification Matters (to the extent permitted pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 8.2(b) (if and to the extent applicable)), by the reduction of
Retained Milestone Amounts in accordance with Section 8.6 and (c) third, with
respect to the Designated Indemnification Matters, recovery against the
amounts then held in the Designated Escrow Fund and (d) fourth, with respect
to (i) Fundamental Indemnification Matters and (ii) General Indemnification
Matters, to the extent permitted pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2(b) (if
and to the extent applicable), directly from each Indemnifying Party in
accordance with such Indemnifying Party's Indemnification Pro Rata Share.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Survival and Claims Periods_. The representations,
warranties and covenants made by the Company in this Agreement shall not be
extinguished by the Closing, but shall survive the Closing for, and all
claims for indemnification in connection therewith may not be asserted later
than, twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , however,
that (a) each of the representations and warranties contained in Section
2.1(a) (Organization and Good Standing), Section 2.2 (Capitalization), Section
2.3(a) (Subsidiaries), Section 2.4(a) (Authority) and Section 2.19 (Brokerage
and Finders), shall survive the Closing without limitation as to time, and the
period during which a claim for indemnification may be asserted in connection
therewith shall be indefinite; (b) each of the representations contained in
Section 2.8 (Taxes) shall survive the closing for, and all claims for
indemnification in connection therewith shall be asserted not later than the
90th day following the end of the period, if any, during which an assessment,
reassessment or other form of document assessing liability for Taxes in
respect of any taxation year to which these representations and warranties
extend could be issued to the Company (together with the representations and
warranties in the preceding clause (a), the " _Fundamental Representations_
") and (c) each of the Specified IP Representations shall survive the Closing
for, and all claims for indemnification in connection therewith shall be
asserted not later than, five (5) years following the Closing Date (such
date, the " _Designated Survival Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
prior to the close of business on the last day a claim for indemnification
may be asserted under this Article VIII the Equityholders' Representative
and the Indemnifying Parties (with respect to direct claims against the
Indemnifying Parties, if applicable) shall have been properly notified of a
claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 8.3 that is an Unresolved Claim, such
claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity under
this Article VIII until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All representations and
warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire as of the
Closing, and any liability of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to cease.

Section 8.6 _Set-Off_.

  



  

(a) If at the time a Milestone Payment becomes due and payable (but
has not been paid) (i) an Indemnified Party has duly delivered pursuant to
Section 8.3 a Notice of Direct Claim or Notice of Third-Party Claim with
respect to any Fundamental Indemnification Matter or a Specified IP Matter,
in each case, that constitutes an Unresolved Claim and (ii) the amount of
Losses that the Indemnified Parties reasonably anticipates to be entitled to
in satisfaction of the claims set forth therein (subject to the limitations in
this Article VIII) with respect to such Fundamental Indemnification Matter or
Specified IP Matters (the " _Anticipated Fundamental Losses_ ") exceeds the
amount then available to satisfy indemnification claims in the General Escrow
Fund and the Designated Escrow Fund (after taking into account all other
Unresolved Claims for indemnification from the General Escrow Fund and/or the
Designated Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Parties delivered pursuant to
Section 8.3), then (A) the amount of the Milestone Payment to be paid at
such time shall be reduced by the amount such Anticipated Fundamental Losses
are greater than the amount then available to satisfy indemnification claims
in the General Escrow Fund and the Designated Escrow Fund (the aggregate
amount of all Anticipated Fundamental Losses withheld from a Milestone
Payment, the " _Retained Milestone Amount_ ")) pending the resolution of such
Unresolved Claim in accordance with this Agreement, (B) Parent shall, subject
to the deposit of the applicable Milestone General Escrow Property or
Designated Escrow Property with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.10,
distribute the remaining portion of such Milestone Payment in accordance with
Section 1.13 and (C) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) provide the Equityholders' Representative with written notice
of the reduction of any Milestone Payments pursuant to this Section 8.6(a).

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 8.4, following the final resolution pursuant
to this Agreement of such claim for indemnification with respect to
the applicable Fundamental Indemnification Matter or Specified IP Matters for
which a Retained Milestone Amount was retained, (A) if Parent has been
finally determined pursuant to such resolution to have suffered aggregate
indemnifiable Losses under this Article VIII with respect to such claim
(subject to the limitations set forth herein) in an amount less than such
Retained Milestone Amount after taking into account the amount of such Losses
to be satisfied from the General Escrow Fund or the Designated Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 8.4, then Parent shall, within ten (10) days after
such final resolution, pay (or shall cause to be paid) the portion of the
Retained Milestone Amount not used to satisfy such indemnifiable Losses to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Equityholders in accordance
with Section 1.13 in the respective amounts they would have been entitled to
receive had such amount not been so retained.

Section 8.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Parent
and the Equityholders agree to treat any payment made under this Article VIII

by applicable Law.

  



  

Article IX 
 EquityHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

  



  

Section 9.1 _Equityholders ' Representative_.

  



  

(a) The Equityholders, by the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and without any further action of any of the Equityholders or
the Company, hereby appoint the Equityholders' Representative as agent and
attorney in fact for the Company and each Equityholder, and authorize the
Equityholders' Representative (i) to take all action necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, or the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which the
Equityholders may be required to indemnify Parent or any other Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article VIII, (ii) to give and receive all notices required
to be given to the Equityholders' Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Related Agreements, (iii) to review,
negotiate and authorize delivery to Parent of the General Escrow Property and
the Designated Escrow Property in satisfaction of claims by Parent and set
off of Milestone Payments pursuant to Section 8.6, (iv) object to such claims
pursuant to this Agreement, (v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into,
or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend, settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with Orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, such claims, resolve any such claims, take any
actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute relating to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by
arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and take or forego any or all
actions permitted or required of any Equityholder or necessary in the
judgment of the Equityholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, (vi) consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Equityholders and (vii) to make decisions on behalf of the Equityholders and
take any and all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or on
behalf of the Equityholders by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, including, without limitation regarding (A)
indemnification claims, Direct Claims, Third-Party Claims, Notices of Third-
Party Claims and Notices of Direct Claims and (B) amendments to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Related Agreements
(other than the Non-Competition Agreements), provided that the Equityholders'
Representative shall not be authorized to (1) receive notice of, or take
action on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying Party in the event that
recourse is being sought hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party, (2)
agree to make any Indemnifying Party directly liable for any Losses in
respect of a claim for indemnification that is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party or (3) treat any of the
Equityholders in a manner that is different or disproportionate from one
another (the " _Limits on Authority_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Equityholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of
the Equityholders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement, the Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are
no obligations of the Equityholders' Representative in any ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule. The Person serving as
the Equityholders' Representative may be removed or replaced from time to
time, or if such Person resigns from its position as the Equityholders'
Representative, then a successor may be appointed, by the holders of a
majority in interest of the aggregate value of property then held in
the General Escrow Fund upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to Parent. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Equityholders' Representative or any member
of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  



    

 | -71-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Subject to the Limits on Authority, all decisions and actions
taken by the Equityholders' Representative in accordance with this Article
IX, including without limitation (i) agreements between the Equityholders'
Representative and Parent relating to the defense or settlement of claims for
which the Equityholders may be required to indemnify Parent pursuant to
Article VIII and (ii) agreements between the Equityholders' Representative
and Parent relating to the Escrow Agreement or the determination of Parent's
payment obligations under Section 1.5 or Section 1.13 or any other matter
relating to Article I, shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders and
each such Equityholder's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Equityholder, and no Equityholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  



  

(c) Certain Equityholders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the " _Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Equityholders' Representative to
provide direction to the Equityholders' Representative in connection with its
services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Engagement
Agreement (such Equityholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither
the Equityholders' Representative nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the " _Equityholders ' Representative Group_") shall
have any liability or obligation to any of the parties to this Agreement or
to the Equityholders for any act done or omitted pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Engagement Agreement as the Equityholders'
Representative while acting in good faith, without gross negligence
or willful misconduct, and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Equityholders shall severally and not jointly
indemnify and defend the Equityholders' Representative Group and hold the
Equityholders' Representative Group harmless against any damage, loss, cost,
liability, fees or expenses (including fees, disbursements and costs of
counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers, judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement) incurred by the Equityholders' Representative and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Equityholders'
Representative's duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Engagement Agreement (collectively, the " _Representative Losses_ "), in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred, _provided_ , that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
of the Equityholders' Representative, the Equityholders' Representative will
reimburse the Equityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith. If not paid directly to the
Equityholders' Representative by the Equityholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Equityholders' Representative first from the
Expense Fund, and second, from any distribution of the General Escrow Fund,
Designated Escrow Fund or Milestone Payment otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders at the time of distribution; _provided_ , that while this
section allows the Equityholders' Representative to be paid from the Expense
Fund, General Escrow Fund, Designated Escrow Fund or Milestone Payment, as
the case may be, this does not relieve the Equityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Equityholders' Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. The Equityholders acknowledge
that the Equityholders' Representative shall not be required to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise
or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant
to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Equityholders' Representative shall not
be required to take any action unless the Equityholders' Representative has
been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination,
are sufficient to protect the Equityholders' Representative against the
costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Equityholders' Representative in performing such actions.

  



    

 | -72-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Subject to the Limits on Authority, the Equityholders'
Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf of each
Equityholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all
instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
Equityholders under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholder
Related Agreements (other than the Non-Competition Agreements).

  



  

(e) The Equityholders, by approval and adoption of this Agreement,
agree, in addition to the foregoing, and solely to the extent consistent with
Section 9.1(a), that:

  



  

(i) Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Equityholders' Representative as to (A)
the settlement of any claims for indemnification by Parent pursuant to
Article VIII, (B) actions taken in respect of indemnification claims, Direct
Claims, Third-Party Claims and Notices of Claims, and (C) any other actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Equityholders' Representative under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any Stockholder Related Agreement
(other than the Non-Competition Agreements), and no Equityholder shall have
any cause of action against Parent for any action taken by Parent in reliance
upon the instructions or decisions of the Equityholders' Representative;

  



  

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Equityholders'
Representative taken in accordance with this Article IX shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Company and all of the Equityholders and no Equityholder
shall have any cause of action against the Equityholders' Representative for
any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Equityholders'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement except for fraud,
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by the
Equityholders' Representative in connection with the matters described in
this Article IX;

  



  

(iii) the provisions of this Article IX are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Equityholder may
have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Stockholder Related Agreements; and

  



    

 | -73-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) the provisions of this Article IX and all actions taken by the
Equityholders' Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Engagement Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal
Representatives, personal Representatives, successor trustees and successors
of each Equityholder as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Equityholder, and any reference in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to
an Equityholder or the Equityholders shall mean and include the successors to
the rights of the Equityholders under this Agreement, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  



  

(f) The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to
the Equityholders' Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equityholder and shall be binding on any
successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
General Escrow Fund.

  



  

(g) The Equityholders' Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Closing Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Equityholder or other
party.

  



  

  

(h) The Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of (i) paying
directly or reimbursing the Equityholders' Representative for any third-party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Engagement
Agreement and any agreement ancillary hereto and (ii) as otherwise determined
by the Advisory Group. The Equityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Equityholders' Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Equityholders'
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations
or advice and will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund
other than as a result of its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
The Equityholders' Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Equityholders' Representative is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days) following the reasonable determination by the
Equityholders' Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to
be withheld, the Equityholders' Representative shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, the amount remaining in the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent, for
further distribution to the Equityholders in accordance with the allocations
provided in Section 1.13(b), _provided_ , that Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Equityholders' Representative to facilitate the payment of
any portion of such payment that is payable to Company Optionholders who are
current or former employees and subject to Tax withholding through Parent's
or its Affiliate's payroll system.

party to this Agreement to any extension or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. A waiver by a party to this Agreement of the
performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation
or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other covenant,
agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A waiver by any
party to this Agreement of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to
be performed at a later time. Following the Closing, this Agreement may not
be amended, modified, altered or supplemented except by written agreement
between Parent and the Equityholders' Representative.

  



  

Section 10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other

understandings (including that certain non-binding term sheet between the
Company, Parent and Sorrento, entered into on January 3, 2019), both written
and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreements shall not be superseded by this Agreement and
shall remain in effect in accordance with their respective terms until the
earlier of: (a) the Closing Date, or (b) the date on which the applicable
Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Execution of Agreement; Counterparts; Electronic
Signatures_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one and the same instrument, and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties to this
Agreement and delivered to the other parties to this Agreement; it being
understood that all parties to this Agreement need not sign the same
counterparts.

  



  

(b) This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
enforceable against the parties to this Agreement that execute such
counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Facsimile and ".pdf" copies of signed signature pages shall
be deemed binding originals and no party to this Agreement shall raise the

Section 10.5 _Governing Law; Arbitration; Venue_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State
of Delaware.

  



  

(b) Any claim or dispute arising under or relating to this
Agreement, including disputes related to the validity, interpretation or
enforcement of any provision this Agreement, shall be finally settled under
the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures by a panel of three
arbitrators (the " _Panel_ "). Parent and the Company shall each select one
arbitrator to represent them, and such two arbitrators together shall select
a third arbitrator for the proceedings. The place of arbitration shall be San
Diego, California. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

  



  

(c) The Panel shall render an award within six months from the date
of the appointment of the Panel, unless the parties to this
Agreement otherwise agree in writing or the Panel determines that an
extension is necessary. The arbitral award shall be in writing, state the
reasons for the award, and be final and binding upon, and non-appealable by,
the parties to this Agreement. The award may include an award of costs,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements.
In addition to monetary damages, the Panel shall be empowered to award
equitable relief, including, but not limited to, an injunction and specific
performance of any obligation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties to this Agreement agree that any of them may
seek equitable relief, including, but not limited to, an injunction and
specific performance of any obligation under this Agreement from any court of
competent jurisdiction, but that the final resolution of any disputes will be
settled solely by the Panel.

  



  

(d) The Panel shall not be empowered to award damages in excess of
compensatory damages, and each party to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably waives any right to recover special, punitive, exemplary,
consequential or similar damages with respect to any dispute, except insofar
as a claim for such award arises out of indemnification against a party in an
action brought against it by an independent third party in which such an
award for special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar damages was
awarded. The Panel shall be authorized in its discretion to grant pre-award
and post-award interest at commercial rates. Judgment upon the award may
be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction
over the relevant party or its assets.

  



  

(e) The Panel, in its discretion, may consolidate two or more
arbitrations or claims between any of the parties to this Agreement
arising under this Agreement or any other agreement among the parties to this
Agreement into one arbitration, or terminate any such consolidation and/or
establish other arbitration proceedings for different claims that may arise in
any one arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Panel shall
consolidate arbitrations and/or claims, if it determines that it would be more
efficient to consolidate such arbitrations and/or claims than to continue
them separately and (i) there are matters of fact or law that are common to
the arbitrations and/or claims to be consolidated, (ii) there are related
payment and performance obligations considered in the arbitrations and/or
claims to be consolidated, or (iii) there is a danger of inconsistent awards.

  



  

(f) The Panel shall render any monetary award and interest related
to such award in U.S. Dollars.

(g) The parties to this Agreement agree that the arbitration shall
be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element
of it (including but not limited to any pleadings, briefs or other documents
submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and any
awards) shall not be disclosed beyond the Panel, the parties, their counsel
and any person necessary to the conduct of the proceeding, except as may be
lawfully required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or
otherwise, or as required by the rules of any other quotation system or
exchange on which the disclosing party's securities are listed or applicable
Laws, _provided_ that the Equityholders' Representative shall not be
prohibited from making any disclosures to the Equityholders.

  



  

(h) The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the losing party
unless otherwise determined by the arbitration award.

  



  

(i) Each party to this Agreement agrees not to assert (by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise), in any such dispute that any
claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the interpretation
or performance of this Agreement is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Panel or that this Agreement may not be enforced by the Panel.

  



  

Section 10.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES OF THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDINGS OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Assignment and Successors_. Subject to Section
1.13(h), no party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties to this Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub may
assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, _provided_  that notwithstanding any
such assignment or delegation, Parent and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall
remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall apply to, be binding in all
respects upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the parties to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement is not intended
to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder, except for the provisions of Section 4.4 (which shall be for the
benefit of (among the other parties hereto) the Company Indemnified Parties,
and the Company Indemnified Parties (among the other parties hereto) will have
the rights provided for therein) and the provisions of Section 10.14 (which
shall be for the benefit of (among the other parties hereto) WSGR and Cooley,
and WSGR and Cooley (among the other parties hereto) will have the rights
provided for therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Closing, the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders)
shall, subject to the terms set forth herein, have the right to bring claims
against Parent, Sorrento and Merger Sub based on Parent's, Sorrento's or
Merger Sub's breach or failure to perform any of the terms or obligations in
this Agreement that would benefit the Equityholders, including claims for
equitable relief, damages and other remedies, (including by bringing a claim
to recover damages, if any, suffered by the Equityholders, which claim may
seek recovery in an amount equal to the Milestone Payments that were not
achieved, as a result of such breach or failure to perform any of the terms
or obligations set forth in Section 1.13) and that such amounts shall be
deemed to be damages of the Equityholders' Representative. The Equityholders'
Representative agrees that if it obtains any amounts from Sorrento, Parent or
Merger Sub, that it shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, such amounts to
the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Equityholders, as if they
constituted Milestone Payments hereunder and the parties shall treat any such
payment as a Milestone Payment for tax reporting purposes, _provided_ , that
Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Equityholders' Representative to
facilitate the payment of any portion of such payment that constitutes an
Option Contingent Payment payable to Company Optionholders who are current or
former employees and subject to Tax withholding through Parent's or its
Affiliate's payroll system.

Communications_ "), such Acquisition Communications shall be deemed to be

Company Product is sold as a fixed dose or co-packaged combination with other
therapeutically active pharmaceutical compound(s) at a single price (a "
_Combination Product_ "), Net Sales from the sale of such Combination Product
will be calculated for each applicable calendar quarter by multiplying the
Net Sales (as determined without reference to this paragraph) of such
Combination Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where (i) A is the average gross
selling price in the applicable country of the Company Product and (ii) B is
the average gross selling price in the applicable country of the other
therapeutically active pharmaceutical compound(s) included in such
Combination Product, each when sold separately in finished form, during the
applicable calendar quarter or, if sales of the Combination Product and the
separate product(s) did not occur during such calendar quarter, the most
recent calendar quarter in which sales of such products occurred. In the event
that the average gross selling price(s) cannot be determined for A or B, the
Net Sales attributable to the Company Product shall be reasonably allocated
between A and B based on their relative fair market values.
