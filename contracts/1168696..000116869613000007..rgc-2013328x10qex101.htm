AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of February 16,
2013, is made by and among Wallace Theater Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), WTH Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company, as representative of the Stockholders (in such capacity,
the "Stockholder Representative"), Regal Entertainment Group, a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser"), and RGCS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser ("Merger Sub").
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set
forth in Article XII below.

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire 100% of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") in a reverse subsidiary
merger transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the
"Merger");

WHEREAS, the Common Stock is or will, at the time of Closing, be held by the
Persons indicated on the attached Stockholders Schedule; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or the equivalent governing
bodies) of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the "DGCL"),
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Purchaser.

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings required
by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
the Purchaser and the Company mutually agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

Conversion of Shares.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party:

(a) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, and any shares of Common Stock
(and the ownership interests represented by such Common Stock) which are held
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the
Company or by the Purchaser or Merger Sub, all of which shall cease to be
outstanding and be canceled and none of which shall receive any payment with
respect thereto) and all rights in respect thereof shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, forthwith
cease to exist and be converted into and represent the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Allocable Portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration attributable to such share of Common Stock plus
any other consideration paid or payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement (other than the Closing Merger Consideration).

(b) Each share of Merger Sub\'s common stock, par value $0.001, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Merger Consideration.



(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser (i) a statement which sets forth in
reasonable detail its good faith calculation of its estimate of: (A) Cash (the
"Estimated Cash"), (B) by payee, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness
(excluding any Indebtedness of the kind defined in clause (ii) of the
definition of Indebtedness) (Indebtedness excluding any Indebtedness of the
kind defined in clause (ii) of the definition of Indebtedness is referred to
herein as "Adjustment Indebtedness") (collectively, the "Estimated Adjustment
Indebtedness"), and the account information necessary for the payment thereof,
(C) Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Amount"), (D) by
payee, the aggregate amount of the Transaction Expenses, and the account
information necessary for the payment thereof, (E) Change of Control Payments
and (F) the Closing Merger Consideration, which shall be certified by the
Company\'s Chief Financial Officer on behalf of and in the name of the Company
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") and which shall include reasonable support
for the calculations made therein and (ii) a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries estimated as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet"). The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Estimated Cash, Estimated Adjustment Indebtedness and Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount shall be determined and prepared on the same basis and in the
same manner as described in Section 2.01. The Company shall provide the
Purchaser with reasonable access as set forth in Section 7.02 and, prior to
the Closing, the Company shall make appropriate revisions to the Estimated
Closing Statement and the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet as are mutually
agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Company.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Closing Merger Consideration"
means (i) $208,125,179 (comprised of two elements $198,000,000 (the "Total
Enterprise Value") and $10,125,179 (the "Working Capital Payment" and together
with the Total Enterprise Value, the "Base Consideration"), minus (ii) the
amount of the Estimated Adjustment Indebtedness, plus (iii) the amount, if
any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the
Target Net Working Capital Amount, minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which the
Target Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount, minus (v) the Escrow Amount, minus (vi) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, plus (vii) the amount of Estimated Cash, minus (viii) the amount of
the Transaction Expenses, minus (ix) the Change of Control Payments.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Final Merger Consideration"
means (i) the Base Consideration, minus (ii) the amount of Adjustment
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to Article II, plus (iii) the
amount, if any, by which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
Article II exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount, minus (iv) the
amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Article II (the amount of
the adjustment in either clause (iii) or (iv), the "Closing Working Capital
Adjustment"), minus (v) the Escrow Amount, minus (vi) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, plus (vii) the amount of Cash as finally determined pursuant to
Article II, minus (viii) the amount of the Transaction Expenses, minus (ix)
the Change of Control Payments.

Common Stock Exchange.

(a) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause a paying agent mutually appointed by
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative to, effect the exchange of
cash for shares of Common



Stock which are entitled to payment pursuant to Section 1.02. On the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall pay each Stockholder who has previously surrendered
his, her or its Common Stock pursuant to a duly executed and delivered letter
of transmittal, substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (each,
a "Letter of Transmittal"), and has complied with all other material
requirements set forth in the instructions thereto the amount of cash to which
each such Stockholder is entitled under Section 1.02. Surrendered shares of
Common Stock shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such share of Common Stock shall represent solely the right to receive
the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration into which it was
converted pursuant to Section 1.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
certificate representing such share of Common Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact and
executing an indemnity agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser or the paying agent by the Person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Purchaser or paying agent, as applicable, shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by
this Article I. In order to effectuate the payment of the Closing Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver the Stockholders Schedule, certified by the Stockholder Representative
and dated as of the Closing Date, which shall designate for each Stockholder
the amount of each Stockholder\'s Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration less such Stockholder\'s portion of the Representative Holdback
Amount as well as the respective account and payment information of such
Stockholder.

(b) No earlier than the first Business Day following the twentieth (20th) day
following the date of the Appraisal Notice and no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause one or more notices to be
delivered to the Warrant Agent as required under that Warrant and Unit
Agreement, dated as June 23, 2009, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank
National Association ("US Bank"), as Unit Agent and Warrant Agent, which
notices shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser and shall notify the Warrantholders that a Liquidity Event (as
defined under the applicable documents governing the terms and conditions of
the Warrants) is expected to occur and that the Warrants are subject to
exercise prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Sections 5 and 8.5
thereof.

1.05 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation
Articles") as of the Effective Time, until duly amended in accordance with
applicable law.

(b) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation By-Laws"), until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by law.



Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.(a) The parties shall take
all requisite actions so that, at the Effective Time, the Company\'s board of
directors shall resign, or are removed, and the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office subject to the applicable
provisions of the Surviving Corporation Articles and the Surviving Corporation
By-Laws.

(b) The parties shall take all requisite actions so that, at the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office subject
to the applicable provisions of the Surviving Corporation Articles and the
Surviving Corporation By-Laws.

Stockholder Representative Holdback A portion of the proceeds otherwise to be
received by the Stockholders pursuant to Article I in an amount determined by
the Stockholder Representative prior to the Closing (such initial deposit, as
it may be increased or decreased at any time in accordance with this
Agreement, the "Representative Holdback Amount") shall be delivered to the
Stockholder Representative at the Closing, on behalf of the Stockholders, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a segregated account (the
"Representative Account") designated by the Stockholder Representative (which
account shall be used only to hold the Representative Holdback Amount and to
pay any fees, costs and expenses of the Stockholder Representative payable out
of the Representative Holdback Amount pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement). The portion of the Representative Holdback Amount delivered to,
and held by, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of each such Stockholder
shall be determined pro rata based upon each Stockholder\'s Residual
Percentage. The Stockholder Representative is entitled to pay on behalf of the
Stockholders, and to the extent paid by the Stockholder Representative from
its own funds, obtain reimbursement for, any fees, costs and expenses incurred
by the Stockholder Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder
("Representative Expenses") from the Representative Holdback Amount, and the
Stockholder Representative shall not use any portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount for any other purpose.

Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time eligible
under the DGCL to exercise appraisal rights and held by a Stockholder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Allocable Portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration set forth on the Stockholders Schedule as
referenced in Section 1.04, and the holder or holders of such Common Stock
shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or
holders in Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 1.08, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or
the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s Common Stock shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration
for such Common Stock set forth on the Stockholders Schedule as referenced in
Section 1.04, without interest, and after surrender of the certificate or, if
applicable, loss affidavit pursuant to Section 1.04, representing such Common
Stock.



ARTICLE II 

MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT

Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation.

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within seventy-five (75) days
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement
showing the calculation of Cash, Adjustment Indebtedness and Net Working
Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (together with the Closing
Balance Sheet, the "Preliminary Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be prepared and Cash, Adjustment Indebtedness and Net Working Capital shall be
determined (including for purposes of Section 1.03(a)) on a consolidated basis
in accordance with Section 2.01(e).

(b) During the thirty (30)-day period immediately following the Stockholder
Representative\'s receipt of the Preliminary Statement (or during the thirty
(30)-day period immediately following the seventy-five (75)-day period
described in Section 2.01(a), if the Purchaser fails to deliver the
Preliminary Statement to the Stockholder Representative within the seventy-
five (75)-day period provided in Section 2.01(a) (in which case, for purposes
of this Section 2.01(b), the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Statement shall be treated as the Preliminary Statement and
will be deemed to have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative on the
seventy-fifth (75th) day after the Closing Date)), the Stockholder
Representative and its advisors and representatives (i) shall be permitted to
review, upon reasonable notice, the Company\'s books and records and the
working papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement
(including the determinations included therein), and (ii) shall be given
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to knowledgeable employees and
accounting professionals of the Purchaser and the Company in order to
facilitate the Stockholder Representative\'s review of the Preliminary
Statement; provided that the review and access described in clauses (i) and
(ii) shall be conducted at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Purchaser\'s or the Company\'s respective
businesses. The Preliminary Statement (including the determinations included
therein) shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the Purchaser and the
Stockholders (A) on the thirtieth (30th) day following the Stockholder
Representative\'s receipt thereof, unless the Purchaser receives from the
Stockholder Representative prior to such thirtieth (30th) day written notice
of the Stockholder Representative\'s disagreement (a "Dispute Notice") with
any account or determination set forth in the Preliminary Statement or (B) on
such earlier date as the Stockholder Representative notifies the Purchaser
that it does not dispute the Preliminary Statement. If the Stockholder
Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice, then the determination of the
Final Merger Consideration shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the
Purchaser and the Stockholders on the first to occur of (x) the date on which
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the disputed items or (y) the date on
which all of the disputed items that are not resolved by the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative in writing are finally resolved in writing by a
nationally recognized accounting firm (other than a so-called "Big Four"
accounting firm) mutually selected by the Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser (the "Accounting Firm") in accordance with Section 2.01(c).



(c) During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect to the disputed
items. Any disputed item resolved in writing by the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive on
the Purchaser and the Stockholders. If the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative do not reach agreement on all of the disputed items during such
thirty (30)-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree),
then at the end of such thirty (30)-day (or longer) period the Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative shall submit all unresolved disputed items
(collectively, the "Unresolved Items") to the Accounting Firm to review and
resolve such matters and each will specify to the other and to the Accounting
Firm its determination of the amount of the Final Merger Consideration (a
party\'s "Proposed Merger Consideration"). The Accounting Firm will determine
each Unresolved Item in accordance with this Section 2.01(c) and Section
2.01(e) as promptly as may be reasonably practicable, and the Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to endeavor
to complete such process within a period of no more than sixty (60) days. The
Accounting Firm may conduct such proceedings as the Accounting Firm believes,
in its sole discretion, will assist in the determination of the Unresolved
Items; provided that, except as the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative may otherwise agree in writing, all communications between the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative or any of their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and the Accounting Firm, on the other hand,
shall be in writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-
communicating party. The Accounting Firm\'s determination of the Unresolved
Items shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Purchaser and the
Stockholders, effective as of the date the Accounting Firm\'s written
determination is received by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne as follows: (x) by
the Stockholder Representative, in a portion equal to a fraction, the
numerator of which is the absolute difference between the Stockholder
Representative\'s Proposed Merger Consideration and the Final Merger
Consideration determined by the Accounting Firm and the denominator of which
is the absolute difference between the Stockholder Representative\'s Proposed
Merger Consideration and the Purchaser\'s Proposed Merger Consideration, and
(y) by the Purchaser, in a portion equal to one (1) minus the fraction
described in the preceding clause (x).

(d) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Final
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b) or Section 2.01(c), either
(i) if the Final Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
Article II is greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, then the
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid through the paying agent, as
applicable, to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis according to each
Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage the amount of such excess, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in
writing by the Stockholder Representative to the Purchaser and the Purchaser
and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
instructions to release an amount equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount from
the Escrow Account to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis according to each
Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage of the amount of such Adjustment Escrow
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing by the Stockholder Representative to the
Purchaser, or (ii) if the Closing Merger Consideration is greater than the
Final Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to Article II, then
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the



Escrow Agent instructions to release to the Purchaser, from the Escrow
Account, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the amount by which the Closing Merger Consideration is greater than the
Final Merger Consideration and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and to
deliver to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis according to each
Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage any amounts that remain of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount after the foregoing release. If the Closing Merger Consideration
is greater than the Final Merger Consideration in an amount that exceeds the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Stockholder Representative shall be obligated to
pay the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to one or more accounts designated by the Purchaser to the Stockholder
Representative; provided, however, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
elect to recover all or any portion of such difference from the Escrow
Account.

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, each accounting term will have the
meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with GAAP as in effect on
December 31, 2012 and, to the extent consistent with GAAP as in effect on
December 31, 2012, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and
methodologies applied in preparing the balance sheet that is part of the
audited Financial Statements and the accompanying statement of income. Each
account included in the Preliminary Statement shall be (i) calculated in
accordance with GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2012, and, to the extent
consistent with GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2012, utilizing the
accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies applied in
preparing the Financial Statements (without regard to materiality), including
with respect to the nature or classification of accounts, and determining
levels of reserves or levels of accruals; and (ii) consistent with the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the definitions herein;
provided that in determining current assets and current liabilities hereunder,
(A) all accounting entries shall be taken into account regardless of their
amount and all known errors and omissions shall be corrected, (B) all known
proper adjustments shall be made, and (C) appropriate reserves for all known
and quantifiable liabilities and obligations for which reserves are
appropriate in accordance with GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2012 shall be
included.

Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) The representations and warranties in this Section 5.13 relate to each
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each bonus or
deferred compensation arrangement, equity based compensation arrangement, and
employment, individual consulting, severance or termination contracts or
agreements, and each other material employee benefit plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy that is maintained, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has material liability, (each, a "Plan" and collectively, the "Plans").
Section 5.13(a) of the attached Employee Benefits Schedule sets forth a list
of each Plan. With respect to each Plan, the Company has made available to the
Purchaser, to the extent applicable, true and complete copies of (i) the most
recent plan and trust documents and any amendments thereto, (ii) the most
recent summary plan description, (iii) the most recent determination letter
received from the Internal Revenue Service, (iv) the three most recent Form
5500 annual reports as filed, (v) the most recent discrimination testing
results, (vi) the current insurance contracts or trusts that implement the
Plan, and (vi) all material correspondence with the IRS or the Department of
Labor for the past three (3) years.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, any other person has engaged in any non-exempt "prohibited
transaction", as defined in Code Section 4975 or ERISA Section 406, with
respect to any Plan. To the Company\'s knowledge, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that as a result of which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any material
liability pursuant to Sections 406 and 409 of ERISA or to either a civil
penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA or a Tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or any other fiduciary of any Plan has any liability for (i)
breach of fiduciary duty or (ii) any other failure to act or comply in
connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Plan
that, in either case, would result in material liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Each of the Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), has received a
favorable determination or prototype opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, and nothing has occurred since the



date of such letter that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the qualified status of such Plan. Each Plan (and each related trust,
insurance contract or fund) has been maintained, funded and administered in
all material respects in compliance with its governing documents and with all
provisions of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

(d) None of the Plans is a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, the minimum
funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has within the past six (6) years
maintained, participated in or contributed to any plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, the minimum funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA and no events have occurred and
no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in such
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation with respect to any
"employee benefit plan", program or arrangement as a consequence of being
considered a single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any other
Person.

(e) No Plan is or ever has been a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
ERISA Section 3(37). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from any such multiemployer
plan or has any liability under or with respect to any such multiemployer
plan. No Plan is a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Code Section 501(c)(9).

(f) There are no Actions pending, or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened
with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals
of denied routine claims). No Plan or, to the Company\'s knowledge, any
fiduciary thereof is or within the last three years has been in connection
with such Plan the subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any
Governmental Entity.

(g) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) and premium payments that are due with respect
to any Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed by ERISA and the
Code to each such Plan.

(h) Except as set forth on Section 5.13(h) of the attached Employee Benefits
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i)
result in the payment of any money or property to any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase any benefit otherwise
payable; or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of, any compensation due from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any employee under any Plan.

(i) Except as set forth on Section 5.13(i) of the attached Employee Benefits
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
to provide life insurance, medical or health benefit coverage on or after
retirement or other termination of employment to any individual other than

insurance to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or that provide

and its Subsidiaries, and the provisions of any contracts set forth on the
Contracts Schedule, relating to insurance coverage; (b) as to any matter that
is pending, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received (i) any

reservation of rights (other than any matter described in Section 5.11(a) of

indication that any policy of insurance is no longer in full force or effect
or that the issuer under any policy of insurance is not willing or able to
perform its obligations thereunder; (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
paid all premiums due, and have otherwise performed in all material respects
their obligations, under each policy of insurance to which they are a party,

Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (including the determinations included
therein)) of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order for the Purchaser to
have the opportunity to make such investigation as it shall reasonably desire
to make of the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) such access does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) such access
shall occur in such a manner as the Company reasonably determines to be
appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (c) nothing herein shall require the Company to provide
access to, or to disclose any information to, the Purchaser if such access or
disclosure (i) would waive any legal privilege or (ii) would be in violation
of applicable Law (including the HSR Act and other anti-competition Laws) or
the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all
information and access provided hereunder shall be subject to the terms and

Company dated August 30, 2012 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(b) The Company shall use reasonable efforts to permit the Purchaser to
conduct any reasonable Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments of the
Owned and Leased Real Property; provided that (i) such examination and
investigation shall be (A) conducted at times and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Company\'s or its



Subsidiaries\' respective businesses and (B) permitted under the Lease for the
property subject to such examination and investigation; provided, however,
that if such examination or investigation is not permitted under the lease,
the Company shall request the prior approval of the landlord or sublandlord,
as required, to perform such examination or investigation (ii) shall be
conducted by ENVIRON International Corporation or another environmental
consultant reasonably acceptable to the Company, and (iii) if any such
examination or investigation results in damage to or alteration of any land or
other premises, the Purchaser (at the Purchaser\'s expense) shall restore the
same to substantially the condition as existed prior to such assessment.

Conditions.

(a) The Company and the Stockholder Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 to be

to deliver, subject to the receipt of the applicable payoff amounts, all
related Lien releases to the Purchaser as soon as practicable after the
Closing.

(c) The Company shall provide, and cause its counsel to provide to the trustee
under the Indenture, all documentation as may be reasonably required to

waivers.

Company and the Stockholder Representative shall (and shall cause the
Company\'s Subsidiaries to), in good faith and in a reasonably timely manner,

the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01, the Company shall not take, shall cause its Stockholders and
Subsidiaries not to take, and shall not cause or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, advisors or representatives to

(including assisting or participating in, or facilitating in any other manner,
any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing)
(collectively, an "Acquisition Proposal"). The Company shall notify the
Purchaser orally (within one (1) Business Day) and in writing (as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days) of all
relevant terms of any inquiry or proposal by a third party to do any of the
foregoing that the Company, its Stockholders or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors or
representatives may receive relating to any of such matters. Immediately after
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Stockholders and Subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees,
advisors or representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities,

condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the representations
and warranties contained in Article V as of the date of this Agreement, or if
the Company acquires knowledge of the occurrence of any fact or condition that
would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute
a breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition. Should any such fact or condition require any change in the
Disclosure Schedules (or the addition of one or more schedules to describe one
or more exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in Article
V) if such Disclosure Schedules were dated the date of the occurrence or
discovery of any such fact or condition, the Company shall promptly deliver to
the Purchaser a supplement to the Disclosure Schedules specifying such
change(s).

(b) If matters disclosed in a notification or supplement delivered pursuant to
Section 7.05(a) (and in any other notification(s) or supplement(s) theretofore
delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a)) could reasonably be expected to result
in Losses (including for the purposes of this Section 7.05(b), consequential
damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages and exemplary
damages) in an aggregate amount that exceeds $19,800,000 (and the Company so
states in writing when it delivers such notification or supplement and
includes a written description in reasonable detail of the Company\'s basis
for such determination), then the Purchaser shall have the right to



terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to that effect to the
Company not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the delivery of
such notification or supplement (and, if necessary, the Closing will be
postponed to such tenth (10th) Business Day); provided that if the Purchaser
has the right to, but does not, so elect to terminate this Agreement within
such ten (10) Business Day period and subsequently the Company delivers to the
Purchaser one or more additional notifications or supplements pursuant to
Section 7.05(a), then the Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of each such
additional notification or supplement.

(c) If matters disclosed in a notification or supplement delivered pursuant to
Section 7.05(a) (and in any other notification(s) or supplement(s) theretofore
delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a)) could reasonably be expected to result
in Losses (including for the purposes of this Section 7.05(c), consequential
damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages and exemplary
damages, but excluding for purposes of this Section 7.05(c) all such extent
actual or anticipated Losses to the extent they arise out of or are
anticipated to arise out of acts or omissions of the Company or any
Stockholder that are material violations or breaches of any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement) in an aggregate amount that exceeds
$34,465,000 (and the Company so states in writing when it delivers such
notification or supplement and includes a written description in reasonable
detail of the Company\'s basis for such determination), then the Company shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to that
effect to the Purchaser not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
delivery of such notification or supplement; provided that if the Company has
the right to, but does not, so elect not to terminate this Agreement within
such ten (10) Business Day period and subsequently the Company delivers to the
Purchaser one or more additional notifications or supplements pursuant to
Section 7.05(a), then the Company shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of each such
additional notification or supplement.

(d) Whether or not the Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.05(b), the delivery of such notification(s) or
supplement(s) shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedules for purposes of Article IX or prevent or cure any such breach for
purposes of Article IX or otherwise affect any rights of the Purchaser under
Article IX (except as provided in the proviso in the first sentence of Section
9.02(c)). If the Purchaser does not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.05(b), then the delivery of such notification(s) and
supplement(s) shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedules for purposes of Articles IV and X or prevent or cure any breach for
purposes of such Articles or otherwise affect any rights of the Purchaser
under Articles IV and X.

(e) If the Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.05(b) following the delivery of any notification or supplement
pursuant to Section 7.05(a) and does not do so within the ten (10) Business
Day period referred to therein, then all such disclosures included in such
notification or supplement or any other notification or supplement delivered
pursuant to Section 7.05(a) delivered to the Purchaser prior to the first day
of such ten (10) Business Day period shall be deemed accepted by the Purchaser
(other than for purposes of Article IX), the condition to Closing set forth in
Section 4.01(a) shall be deemed waived with respect to the matters so
disclosed in any such notification or supplement, and the disclosure relative
to the Company\'s



representations and warranties shall be deemed modified or supplemented as
indicated in all such notifications and supplements for purposes of Article X.

(f) In addition to the foregoing, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, the Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of the Company in this Article VII or
Article XI of the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of
the conditions in Article IV impossible or unlikely.

Stockholder Approval and Information Statement. The Company shall (a)
immediately following the execution of this Agreement upon consideration of

thereof under Sections 228(e) and 262 of the DGCL that (i) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the agreements contemplated in
connection herewith and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been approved, and (ii) that appraisal
rights are available for its shares of Common Stock (the "Appraisal Notice").
The Company shall cause the Appraisal Notice and the delivery thereof to the
Stockholders to comply in all respects with Sections 228(e) and 262 of the
DGCL. Immediately following the twentieth (20th) day after the date of mailing

Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company shall notify the Purchaser in writing of
the identity of any holders of Dissenting Shares and the number of shares for

the Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement request that the

Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain such a Lessor
Estoppel from each such lessor. The Company and the Purchaser shall make such

reasonably request. Within five (5) calendar days of receipt of any Lessor
Estoppel executed by any such lessor, the Company shall deliver a true and
complete copy thereof to the Purchaser.

(c) With respect to each Lease which is a sublease, the Company shall promptly
after the date of this Agreement request that each superior lessor execute a

commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain such a non-disturbance
agreement, and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser;
provided that the Company shall have no such obligation with respect to any
superior lessor that has previously executed such a commercially reasonable
non-disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser.

(d) With respect to each Lease which is, or may be, subordinate to a mortgage
or deed of trust executed by the lessor, or by a superior lessor, the Company
shall promptly after the date of this Agreement request that the mortgagee or
beneficiary of each such deed of trust execute a non-disturbance agreement in
form and substance reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The Company and the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain such a

obligation with respect to any mortgagee or beneficiary that has previously
executed such a non-disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser.

(e) With respect to each Lease for which a memorandum of lease is not recorded
in the official real property records in which the Leased Real Property is

that the lessor thereunder execute a memorandum of lease in form and substance
reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The Company and the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain such memoranda of lease,
duly executed and acknowledged by such lessor and otherwise in recordable
form. Within five (5) calendar days of receipt by the Company of any such
memorandum executed by any such lessor, the Company shall deliver a true and
complete copy thereof to the Purchaser.

(f) The Purchaser may refuse to approve a lessor consent or estoppel on any
reasonable grounds. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain releases of all guaranties of the Company\'s and any Subsidiary\'s
obligations given by any Person under any Lease, including furnishing any
guaranties, additional deposits, letters of credit or other security for
performance of the lessee\'s obligations under any of the Leases that any
landlord may reasonably request.

(g) Notwithstanding anything set forth in any estoppel, consent, non-
disturbance agreement or other memorandum which is executed or delivered
pursuant to this Section 7.07, as between the Purchaser and the Company, this
Agreement shall govern the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities
under and with respect to the Leases.

after the date hereof a list of the employees of the Company that will be
terminated in connection with the Closing ("Separated Employees"). Upon

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

(7) years, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders and their authorized
representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, at the sole expense of the Stockholder
Representative or the Stockholders, to (i) the books and records (for the
purpose of examining and copying) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required in connection
with (x) the preparation of any Tax Returns or with any audit thereof, (y) any
financial reporting related to the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, or (z) any Action involving the
Stockholders relating to the operation of the business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, unless such Action could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a Purchaser Party making an indemnity claim
pursuant to Article IX, in which event the Purchaser\'s obligations under
Section 9.04 shall supersede its obligations under this clause (z), and (ii)
employees of the Purchaser for purposes of better understanding such books and
records; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Stockholder Representative, the Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts not to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
to, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter
or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior notice to the Stockholder Representative and offering to
surrender to the Stockholder Representative such books and records or any
portion thereof which the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation may intend to
destroy, alter or dispose of; provided, however, that any electronic books or
records of the Surviving Corporation may be maintained, destroyed or disposed

notify the Stockholder Representative and the Company in writing if the
Purchaser acquires knowledge of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in
Article VI as of the date of this Agreement, or if the Purchaser acquires
knowledge of the occurrence of any fact or condition that would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any
such representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made
as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition.



Employment and Benefit Arrangements.

(a) The Purchaser shall be responsible for all obligations arising under or
pursuant to COBRA for all "M and A qualified beneficiaries" as defined under
Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that any
"MandA qualified beneficiary" who elects to receive COBRA coverage from the
Purchaser must pay (or have paid on his or her behalf) the COBRA premium
amount in order to obtain such coverage. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Purchaser to terminate the employment of
any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time and for any
or no reason on or after the Effective Time. No provision of this Section 8.03
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
beneficiary or dependent of any such employee or former employee. In addition,
nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any other Person any right to employment or continued

(15) days prior to the Closing, the Company shall adopt written resolutions to
terminate the Company\'s 401(k) plan and to one hundred percent (100%) vest
all participants under said Company 401(k) plan, such termination and vesting
to be effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing;
provided, however, that such Company 401(k) Plan termination may be made
contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such termination of the Company\'s 401(k) plan is requested, the
Purchaser shall following the Closing permit employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who were participants in the Company\'s 401(k) plan to
immediately participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, and the Purchaser shall cause all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to be credited for participation and vesting purposes under such
401(k) plan of the Purchaser or its Affiliates with the service that was
credited for similar purposes under the Company\'s 401(k) plan as of the
Closing Date.

Conditions. The Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 to be satisfied as
soon as practicable following the date hereof, to cause the Closing to occur
as expeditiously as possible following the execution of this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible
after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IV (other than
those to be satisfied at the Closing itself); provided that the Purchaser and
Merger Sub shall not be required to waive any condition set forth in Section
4.01 to its obligations hereunder

Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and
the Purchaser\'s Representatives may only contact and communicate with the
employees (other than the Company\'s officers and senior personnel, which
shall not require prior approval), customers, service



providers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby after prior consultation with and
approval of the Stockholder Representative, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Information, Etc. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Company nor any Affiliate or representative of the Company has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to the
Purchaser and its representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article V
or in the Letter of Transmittal, and the Stockholders shall not have or be
subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting from
the distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchaser\'s use of or reliance on,
any such information or any information, documents or material made available
to the Purchaser in any data room, presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions. Except to the extent a different period is expressly set forth
herein, any claim for indemnification hereunder in respect of a Stockholder
Limited Indemnity Item or Purchaser Limited Indemnity Item must be asserted in
a writing delivered to the Stockholder Representative or the Purchaser, as the
case may be, by no later than the date that is the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Survival Period Termination Date") and,
if asserted by such date, such claim shall survive the Survival Period
Termination Date until final resolution thereof. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, including the foregoing sentence, (a) the covenants of
the parties set forth in Article I and Article II (each, an "Excluded
Covenant" and collectively the "Excluded Covenants") shall survive according
to their respective terms and (b) the Survival Period Termination Date with
respect to any covenant that is the subject of a claim for indemnification
hereunder shall include any subsequent period of time until any dispute
regarding the performance of or compliance with such covenant is finally
resolved.

Indemnification from the Escrow Account for the Benefit of the Purchaser.

(a) The Stockholders agree that, after the Closing, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article IX the Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates (which following the Closing shall
include the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and each of their
officers, directors, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Purchaser
Parties"), from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions,
causes of actions, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs of
investigation or settlement, other professionals\' and experts\' fees, and
court or arbitration costs but specifically excluding (except to the extent
the same may be awarded to a third party in a Third Party Claim) consequential
damages, lost profits, indirect damages, punitive damages and exemplary
damages ("Losses"), to have arisen out of or to have resulted from, in
connection with, or by virtue of (i) facts or circumstances that constitute an
inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach



of, default in, or failure to perform, any of the representations or
warranties given or made by the Company or the Stockholder Representative in
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(g)(i),
(ii) facts or circumstances that constitute a breach of, default in, or
failure to perform, any of the covenants given or made by the Company or the
Stockholder Representative in this Agreement ((i) and (ii) collectively with
Section 11.03(a), the "Stockholder Limited Indemnity Items"), (iii) any
Transaction Expenses, or (iv) Adjustment Indebtedness. For the avoidance of
doubt, no Purchaser Party shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 9.02(a) for any liability to the extent such liability is actually
reflected in the final Net Working Capital used to determine the Final Merger
Consideration.

(b) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be
affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation or
assessment) conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date.

(c) The aggregate liability of the Stockholders on account of all Stockholder
Limited Indemnity Items pursuant to Section 9.02 and Section 11.03(a) shall be
limited to $19,800,000 (the "Cap"), and claims for Losses in respect of
Stockholder Limited Indemnity Items shall be limited to such amount, whether
the Purchaser Party in question is the Purchaser or another Purchaser Party;
provided that (i) if the Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.05 prior to the Closing and does not do so, then the Cap
will be reduced by the amount, if any, of the Limited 7.05 Liabilities
included in determining the Closing Working Capital Adjustment (but not by an
amount that exceeds the amount of the Cap prior to such adjustment) or (ii) to
the extent that a liability is reflected in the final Net Working Capital used
to determine Final Merger Consideration, which arose from a Limited 7.05
Liability (without taking into account clause (ii) of such definition), then
the Cap will be reduced by the amount, if any, of such liabilities included in
determining the Closing Working Capital Adjustment (but not by an amount that
exceeds the amount of the Cap prior to such adjustment) (such reductions in
clauses (i) and (ii), the "Section 7.05 Reductions"). Without limiting the
foregoing, other than the Excluded Covenants, the Purchaser Parties\' sole
recourse in respect of Stockholder Limited Indemnity Items shall be to the
amounts held from to time by the Escrow Agent and not theretofore released
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Section 7.05 Reductions and the parties agree that any
amounts in excess of such reduced Escrow Amount shall be returned to the
Stockholder Representative. In addition, except with respect to the Excluded
Covenants, the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.02 in respect of
the Stockholder Limited Indemnity Items shall not apply unless and until the
aggregate Losses determined to be due for which one or more Purchaser Parties
seek or have sought indemnification hereunder in respect of such claims
exceeds a cumulative aggregate of $1,980,000 (the "Deductible"), in which
event the Purchaser Parties shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be
indemnified for such Losses to the extent in excess of the Deductible. In
addition, except with respect to the Excluded Covenants, no individual claim
or series of related claims by the Purchaser shall be so asserted unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant to such
claim or claims exceeds an amount equal to $5,000 (the "Mini-Basket") (it
being understood that any such individual or aggregated claims for amounts
less than



the Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in determining whether the Deductible has
been exceeded and thereafter).

(d) In view of the Deductible and Mini-Basket, and solely for purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses, the representations and warranties of
the Company, the Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative set forth in
this Agreement (or in any instrument, certificate or affidavit delivered at
the Closing with respect thereto) shall be considered without regard to any
qualification based on materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein.

(e) The amount to which a Purchaser Party may become entitled under this
Article IX shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by way of payment,
discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) received from a third
party (including any insurer) less any cost associated with receiving such
recovery in respect of a claim. To the extent that insurance, "pass-through"
warranty coverage from a manufacturer or other form of recovery or
reimbursement from a third party is available to any Purchaser Party to cover
any item for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause each other Purchaser Party to, on a timely and
expeditious basis, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect recovery
under applicable insurance policies, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue to conclusion available remedies or causes of action to recover the
amount of its claim as may be available from such other party; provided that
the availability of a potential recovery against such a third party shall not
affect the Purchaser\'s right to make a claim for indemnity pursuant to this
Section 9.02. To the extent of any indemnification with respect to any claim
referred to in the previous sentence, the Purchaser shall assign, and the
Purchaser shall cause each other Purchaser Party to assign, to the Stockholder
Representative, to the fullest extent allowable, its claim against such
insurance, warranty coverage or third party claim, or in the event assignment
is not permissible, but the Purchaser or the other Purchaser Party in question
is nonetheless permitted to pursue such claim on the Stockholder
Representative\'s behalf, the Purchaser shall pursue, or shall cause such
other Purchaser Party to pursue, such claim, at the Stockholder
Representative\'s direction and expense and without additional out-of-pocket
expense to any Purchaser Party, with any recovery thereon to be transmitted
promptly to the Stockholder Representative upon receipt for distribution to
the Stockholders. To the extent that indemnification has not been paid on
account of any such claim, any Purchaser Party may pursue recovery against
such insurance warranty coverage or third party and shall be entitled to
retain all recoveries made as a result of any such action. The Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
furnish the Stockholder Representative with such information respecting the
assets, business and financial records of the Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries relating to any such claims as the
Stockholder Representative may, from time to time, reasonably request and at
the sole cost and expense of the Stockholder Representative. After the
Closing, the Purchaser shall maintain in effect, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect, in each case until the
Survival Period Termination Date, or for such longer time as there remains a
claim outstanding pursuant to this Section 9.02, insurance coverage in
amounts, and with coverage, not materially less favorable to the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries than the insurance coverage as maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. In
addition, the amount to which the Purchaser Parties may become entitled under
this Article IX shall be net of any Tax benefits theretofore realized by the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its



Subsidiaries, after the Closing) (offset by the amount of any Tax detriments)
in respect of Losses to be indemnified hereunder, and as and when the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates realizes any Tax benefits and detriments in
respect of Losses theretofore indemnified hereunder, the Purchaser shall pay
the Stockholder Representative an amount equal to the amount of such Tax
benefit so realized net of any Tax detriment.

(f) Each Purchaser Party shall be responsible for taking or causing to be
taken reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that may be
indemnifiable under this Article IX.

Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Stockholders.

(a) The Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article IX, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders or any of their
Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, partners, members,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Parties"), from and against any and all Losses to
have arisen out of or to have resulted from, in connection with or by virtue
of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser or
Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any of the certificates or other
instruments or documents furnished by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
4.02(d)(i) or (ii) facts or circumstances that constitute a breach of, default
in, or failure to perform, any of the covenants given or made by the Purchaser
in this Agreement (collectively, the "Purchaser Limited Indemnity Items"). The
aggregate liability of the Purchaser on account of all indemnification claims
made pursuant to this Section 9.03(a) shall be limited to the Cap, and claims
for Losses in respect of such matters shall be limited to such amount, whether
the Seller Party in question is the Stockholder Representative or another
Seller Party. In addition, except as it relates to the Excluded Covenants, the
indemnification provided for in this Section 9.03(a) in respect of the Seller
Parties shall not apply unless and until the aggregate Losses determined to be
due for which one or more Seller Parties seek or have sought indemnification
hereunder in respect of such indemnification matters exceeds the Deductible,
in which event the Seller Parties shall, subject to the other limitations
herein, be indemnified for such Losses to the extent in excess of the
Deductible.

(b) In view of the Deductible, and solely for purposes of determining the
amount of any Losses, the representations and warranties of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement (or in any instrument, certificate or
affidavit delivered at the Closing with respect thereto) shall be considered
without regard to any qualification based on materiality or "material adverse
effect" set forth therein.

(c) The amount to which a Seller Party may become entitled under this Article
IX shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by way of payment, discount,
credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) received from a third party
(including any insurer) less any cost associated with receiving such recovery
in respect of a claim. To the extent that insurance, "pass-through" warranty
coverage from a manufacturer or other form of recovery or reimbursement from a
third party is available to any Seller Party to cover any item for which
indemnification may be sought hereunder, the Stockholder Representative shall,
or shall cause each other Seller Party to, on a timely and expeditious basis,
use commercially reasonable efforts to effect recovery under



applicable insurance policies and warranties, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue to conclusion available remedies or causes of action to
recover the amount of its claim as may be available from such other party;
provided that the availability of a potential recovery against such a third
party shall not affect any Seller Party\'s right to make a claim for indemnity
pursuant to this Section 9.03. To the extent of any indemnification with
respect to any claim referred to in the previous sentence, the Stockholder
Representative shall assign, and the Stockholder Representative shall cause
each other Seller Party to assign, to the Purchaser, to the fullest extent
allowable, its claim against such insurance, warranty coverage or third party
claim, or in the event assignment is not permissible, but the Stockholder
Representative or the other Seller Party in question is nonetheless permitted
to pursue such claim on the Purchaser\'s behalf, the Stockholder
Representative shall pursue, or shall cause such other Seller Party to pursue,
such claim, at the Purchaser\'s direction and expense and without additional
out-of-pocket expense to any Seller Party, with any recovery thereon to be
transmitted promptly to the Purchaser upon receipt. To the extent that
indemnification has not been paid on account of any such claim, any Seller
Party may pursue recovery against such insurance warranty coverage or third
party and shall be entitled to retain all recoveries made as a result of any
such action. In addition, the amount to which the Seller Parties may become
entitled under this Article IX shall be net of any Tax benefits theretofore
realized by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders and their
Affiliates (offset by the amount of any Tax detriments) in respect of Losses
to be indemnified hereunder, and as and when the Stockholder Representative,
any Stockholder or any of their Affiliates realizes any Tax benefits in
respect of Losses theretofore indemnified hereunder, the Stockholder
Representative shall pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of such
Tax benefit so realized net of any Tax detriment. The Stockholder
Representative shall furnish the Purchaser with such information respecting
the assets, business and financial records of the Stockholder Representative
or any Stockholder relating to any such claims as the Purchaser may, from time
to time, reasonably request and at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser.

(d) Each Seller Party shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken
reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that may be
indemnifiable under this Article IX.

Notice of Claim.

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification by any
Purchaser Party or any Seller Party, as the case may be, for Losses under this
Article IX (such Person making a Claim, an "Indemnitee"). An Indemnitee shall
give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Losses or for
Losses incurred by any other Purchaser Party or Seller Party, as applicable,
pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by an officer of the
Purchaser or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable (a "Notice of
Claim"), and delivered to the Stockholder Representative or the Purchaser, as
applicable (such receiving party, the "Indemnitor"), promptly after such
Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by such
Indemnitee for indemnification under this Article IX (but in any event not
later than the Survival Period Termination Date) arising out of or resulting
from: (i) any item subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section
9.01 or Section 9.02; or (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing,
against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding



brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a "Third
Party Claim") that arises out of or results from any item subject to
indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 9.01 or Section 9.02;
provided that no failure or delay in the giving of such notice (so long as
such notice is given not later than the Survival Period Termination Date, in
the case of a Claim relating to a Stockholder Limited Indemnity Item or
Purchaser Limited Indemnity Item) shall adversely affect the Indemnitee\'s
rights with respect to such claim, unless (and then only to the extent that)
the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.(b) Each
Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall contain the following information:

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend any Third Party Claim, and
the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such
defense by the Indemnitor (including attorneys\' fees, other professionals\'
and experts\' fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid by the
Indemnitor.

(b) Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third Party Claim to
the Indemnitor; provided that (so long as such notice is given on or prior to
the Survival Period Termination Date, in the case of a Claim relating to a
Stockholder Limited Indemnity Item or Purchaser Limited Indemnity Item) the
failure timely to give such notice shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitee\'s
right to indemnity hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume
the defense thereof utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee; provided that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume
control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnitee if the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation.

(c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall, at the Indemnitee\'s request, permit the
Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof.
The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall make available to each
other and each other\'s counsel and accountants, without charge, all of its or
their books and records relating to the Third Party Claim, and each party will
render to the other party such assistance as may be reasonably required in
order to insure the proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the other party in connection therewith.

(d) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the right to enter into any settlement
of a Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee; provided that
(i) such settlement does not involve any injunctive or other equitable relief
binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) such settlement
expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from all liability with
respect to such claim, without prejudice, other than the obligation to pay any
amount that the Indemnitor pays or causes to be paid.

Exclusive Remedy.

(a) After the Closing, the indemnification rights set forth in this Article IX
are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser, the other
Purchaser Parties, the



Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative and the other Seller Parties
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9.06 shall not be deemed a
waiver by any party of its right to seek specific performance or injunctive
relief in the case of another party\'s failure to comply with the covenants
made by such other party to be performed after the Closing, or any remedy of
any party in respect of any fraud committed by any other party. In addition,
the parties agree that Section 9.06(a) and the limitations set forth in this
Article IX shall not apply to any fraud or the willful breach of any covenant
committed by any party (provided that for purposes of Section 7.05(a),
"willful breach" shall mean (i) that any of Scott C. Wallace, Chuck Kirk or
Clyde Cornell either (A) had actual knowledge of the underlying breach of
representation or warranty required to be reported under Section 7.05(a), or
(B) intentionally disregarded their duty of inquiry with their direct reports,
and (ii) that any such direct report whose conduct caused the breach actually
knew such conduct would cause a breach under Section 7.05(a)).

ARTICLE X 

TERMINATION

Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders;

(b) by the Purchaser if (i) the Company or the Stockholder Representative
shall have breached, or failed to comply with, in any material respect any of
their obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any representation or warranty
made by the Company or the Stockholder Representative shall have been
incorrect in any material respect when made or shall have since ceased to be
true and correct in any material respect, and such breach, failure or
misrepresentation is not cured within twenty (20) days after written notice
thereof is delivered to the breaching party and either (x) such breaches,
failures or misrepresentations render the closing conditions of the non-
breaching party incapable of being satisfied or (y) such breach or failure is
a failure or refusal to consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated
herein as required pursuant to Section 3.01 (provided that, in the case of any
action or inaction described in this clause (y), the 20-day period described
in clause (ii) above shall instead be a two (2) Business Day period);

(c) by the Company and the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, if (i) the Purchaser shall have breached, or failed to comply
with, in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement or
(ii) any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser shall have been
incorrect in any material respect when made or shall have since ceased to be
true and correct in any material respect, and such breach, failure or
misrepresentation is not cured within twenty (20) days after written notice
thereof is delivered to the breaching party and either (x) such breaches,
failures or misrepresentations render the closing conditions of the non-
breaching party incapable of being satisfied or (y) such breach or failure is
a failure or refusal to consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated
herein as required pursuant to Section



3.01 (provided that, in the case of any action or inaction described in this
clause (y), the 20-day period described in clause (ii) above shall instead be
a two (2) Business Day period);

(d) by the Purchaser or the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, upon written notice to the other parties hereto, if the
transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated on or before the
date that is 90 days after the date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date");
provided that, in each case, the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(d) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing of the transactions;

(e) by either the Purchaser or the Company, if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued a Governmental Order or taken any other action, in each case which
has become final and non-appealable and which restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits the Merger;

(f) by the Purchaser or the Company, as provided in Section 7.05; or

(g) by the Purchaser, if the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained within
five (5) days after the date of this Agreement.

Effect of Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated under Section 10.01(a), Section 10.01(d)
or Section 10.01(e) at a time when no party is in material violation or breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement then all further
liabilities and obligations of the Company, the Stockholder Representative or
the Stockholders to the Purchaser and the Purchaser to the Company, the
Stockholder Representative or the Stockholders will terminate without further
liability of any party hereto.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated under Section 10.01 (other than under
Section 10.01(a)) at a time when a party is in material violation or breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then the liabilities and
obligations of the party not in such violation or breach shall terminate and
the party or parties that are in violation or breach of this Agreement shall
remain liable therefor and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
the remedies available against such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company, the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders will only be
liable for their willful breach of any covenant (provided that for purposes of
Section 7.05(a), "willful breach" shall mean (i) that any of Scott C. Wallace,
Chuck Kirk or Clyde Cornell either (A) had actual knowledge of the underlying
breach of representation or warranty required to be reported under Section
7.05(a), or (B) intentionally disregarded their duty of inquiry with their
direct reports, and (ii) that any such direct report whose conduct caused the
breach actually knew such conduct would cause a breach under Section 7.05(a))
or fraud.

(c) If the Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 10.01, the parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause, to the extent
practicable, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to
this Agreement to be withdrawn from the agency or other Person to which they
were made.



ARTICLE XI 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Disclosure Generally. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement,
including all Disclosure Schedules.

Provision Respecting Legal Representation. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that each of the Stockholder Representative, Company, the
Stockholders, their Subsidiaries and GTCR LLC have retained Kirkland and Ellis
LLP ("KandE") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that KandE has not acted as counsel for any other party
hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none
of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of KandE for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The Purchaser, Merger Sub,
the Stockholder Representative, the Company, the Stockholders and their
respective Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their respective directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, and/or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Stockholders, the Stockholder
Representative, GTCR LLC or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
KandE may represent the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders, GTCR LLC
and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders, GTCR LLC and/or such Affiliates
may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries. The Purchaser and Merger Sub further agree that, as to
all communications among KandE, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholders, GTCR LLC and/or any of their respective
Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Stockholders and may be controlled by the
Stockholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other
than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by KandE to such third party; provided, however, that neither the Surviving
Corporation nor its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders, and GTCR LLC.

Tax Matters.

(a) Subject to the limitations of Article IX made applicable to this Section
11.03(a), the Stockholders shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and
hold harmless hereunder the Purchaser Parties from and against any Losses
attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods or portions thereof ending on



or before the Closing Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was
a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes are imposed
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of an event or
transaction occurring prior to the Closing, and (iv) any Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries imposed upon or arising from the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (collectively, together with any
other amounts for which the Purchaser Parties may be entitled to be
indemnified for under this Section 11.03(a), the "Indemnified Taxes");
provided, that no indemnity shall be provided under this Section 11.03(a) for
Losses for Taxes to the extent taken into account in the final calculation of
Net Working Capital, Adjustment Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Change
of Control Payments pursuant to Section 2.01. In the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the
portion of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (A)
in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales, use or withholding
Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income or payments, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (B) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included
the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership
or other pass‑through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time). The Stockholder Representative
shall reimburse the Purchaser for any Taxes that are the responsibility of the
Stockholders no later than ten (10) Business Days after the later of (i) the
date the Stockholder Representative receives written notice of such claim from
the Purchaser and (ii) payment of such Taxes by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the applicable Governmental Entity. The Purchaser\'s sole
recourse in respect of any amounts for Taxes due from the Stockholders
pursuant to this Section 11.03(a) shall be the amounts held from time to time
by the Escrow Agent and not theretofore released pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date the
due date of which (including extensions) is before the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Returns") and shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date the due date of
which (including extensions) is after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing
Returns"). Each Pre-Closing Return and Post-Closing Return shall be prepared
and timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. A reasonable period of time prior to the
date on which each such Pre-Closing Return with respect to income Taxes (each
a "Pre-Closing Income Return") and Post-Closing Return is required to be filed
(such reasonable period to be not less than thirty (30) days in the case of
income Tax Returns), the Stockholder Representative (in the case of a Pre-
Closing Income Return) or the



Purchaser (in the case of a Post-Closing Return) shall submit such Tax Return
to the Purchaser (in the case of a Pre-Closing Income Return) or the
Stockholder Representative (in the case of a Post-Closing Return) for its
review and comment. Prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns
(at least fifteen (15) days prior in the case of income Tax Returns), the
party reviewing the Tax Return shall notify the party preparing the Tax Return
of any objection the party reviewing the Tax Return may have to any items set
forth on such draft Tax Return. If, after consulting in good faith, the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve such
objection(s), such objection(s) shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for
resolution in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company (except
as otherwise required by Law). In preparing the Tax Returns pursuant to this
Section 11.03(b), the Company, the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative agree that the fair market value of the assets acquired
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement is equal to the Purchase Price as
defined therein.

(c) If the Accounting Firm is unable to make a determination with respect to
any disputed item within five (5) days prior to the due date for the filing of
the Tax Return in question, then the party preparing the Tax Return may file
such Tax Return on the due date thereof without such determination having been
made and without the consent of the party reviewing the Tax Return.
Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax Return, the Accounting Firm shall make
a determination with respect to any disputed item, and the amount of Taxes for
which the Stockholders are responsible under Section 11.03(a) shall be
determined by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm will determine the
allocation of the cost of its involvement in the matter based on the inverse
of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Accounting Firm.

(d) At its election, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
represent (at its own expense and through counsel of its choice) the Company
and its Subsidiaries\' interests in respect of, and shall have control of the
defense, compromise or other resolution of, any audit, proceeding, litigation
or examination by any Governmental Entity relating to Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (each, a "Tax Audit") for any tax periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, provided that prior to assuming control or defense of any
such Tax Audit the Stockholder Representative undertakes in writing to
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes arising from the
disposition of such Tax Audit (except to the extent an amount with respect to
such Taxes was included in the final calculation of Net Working Capital,
Adjustment Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Change of Control Payments);
provided, further that (i) the Purchaser shall be entitled to participate at
its own expense in such Tax Audit, and (ii) the Stockholder Representative may
not settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax Audit for which the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Affiliates may have liability that is not indemnified
or indemnifiable by Stockholders hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser, which consent will not be withheld, delayed or conditioned
unreasonably. In the case of a Tax Audit for a tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date for which Stockholder Representative does not assume control
pursuant to the preceding sentence or a tax period including but not ending on
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Stockholder Representative shall
be entitled to participate at its own expense in any Tax Audit relating in any
part to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period deemed to
end on the Closing Date. Except as described in the first sentence of this
Section 11.03(d), the Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Audit.
However, none of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates



(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) may settle or
otherwise dispose of any Tax Audit for which Stockholders or any of their
Affiliates may have liability, or which may result in an increase in
Stockholders\' or their Affiliates\' liability, without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent will not be withheld,
delayed or conditioned unreasonably.

(e) Except as required by applicable Law, without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative (which consent will not be withheld, delayed or
conditioned unreasonably, for which purpose the withholding or conditioning of
the Stockholder Representative\'s consent on the basis that any such action
not increase Stockholders\' liability under Article IX or Section 11.03(a)
shall be deemed reasonable), the Purchaser will not (i) except for Tax Returns
that are filed in accordance with Section 11.03(b) and (c) file or amend or
permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to file or amend any Tax
return relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) with respect to Tax
Returns filed pursuant to Section 11.03(b) or (c), amend or permit any of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to amend any such Tax Return (except
pursuant to a determination by the Accounting Firm as provided for in Section
11.03(c)) or (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or
permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to extend or waive, any
statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (provided, however, that
nothing herein shall prohibit or constrain the right of the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to request or obtain an
extension of the due date for filing any Tax Return).

(f) The Purchaser and the Stockholders will each pay fifty percent (50%) of
any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property transfer
or real property gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or
other similar Tax imposed on the Company or the Stockholders as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The
Stockholder Representative agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by

ARTICLE XIII 

MISCELLANEOUS

Stockholder Representative.

(a) Designation. The Stockholder Representative is hereby designated by each
of the Stockholders to serve as the Stockholder Representative of the
Stockholders with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement
to be performed by the Stockholder Representative.

(b) Authority. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the DGCL, the
Stockholders hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the Stockholder
Representative as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney‑in‑fact for
each of the Stockholders for all purposes authorized under this Agreement,
including the full power and authority on the Stockholders\' behalf (i) to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein; (ii) to pay such
Stockholder\'s expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date hereof),
including by using funds from the Representative Holdback Amount; (iii) to
disburse any funds received hereunder to such Stockholder and each other
Stockholder; (iv) to endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments
representing the Common Stock and execute such further instruments of
assignment as the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall reasonably request; (v) to
execute and deliver on behalf of such Stockholder any amendment or waiver
hereto; (vi) (A) to dispute or refrain from disputing, on behalf of such
Stockholder relative to any amounts to be received by such Stockholder under
this Agreement or any agreements contemplated hereby, any claim made by the
Purchaser under this Agreement or other agreements contemplated hereby, (B) to
negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Stockholder, any dispute that may
arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any remedies available
under, this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, and (C) to
execute, on behalf of such Stockholder, any settlement agreement, release or
other document with respect to such dispute or remedy; (vii) to engage
attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of the Stockholders in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and
paying any fees related thereto; (viii) to take all other actions to be taken
by or on behalf of such Stockholder in connection herewith; (ix) to retain the
Representative Holdback Amount and pay amounts therefrom in accordance with
this Agreement; and (x) to do each and every act and exercise any and all
rights which such Stockholder or the Stockholders collectively are permitted
or required to do or exercise under this Agreement). Each of the Stockholders
agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholder Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Stockholder. If any Stockholder dies or becomes incapacitated, disabled or
incompetent (such deceased, incapacitated, disabled or incompetent Stockholder
being a "Former Stockholder") and, as a result, the agency and power of
attorney conferred by this Section 13.01 is revoked by operation of law, it
shall not be a breach by such Former Stockholder under this Agreement if the
heirs, beneficiaries, estate, administrator, executor, guardian, conservator
or other legal representative of such Former Stockholder (each a "Successor
Stockholder") confirms the appointment of the Stockholder Representative as
agent and attorney-in-fact for such Successor Stockholder. In addition, if the
agency and power of attorney conferred by this Section 13.01 is revoked by
operation of law and thereafter not reconfirmed by the Successor Stockholder
prior to the Closing, such revocation shall



not be deemed a breach by the Successor Stockholder of any of the provisions
of this Agreement provided that the shares of Common Stock held by such
Successor Stockholder are delivered for transfer to the Purchaser at the
Closing as contemplated by Section 1.04, and further provided that such
Successor Stockholder executes and delivers such other certificates, documents
or instruments that would have been delivered on its behalf by the Stockholder
Representative had such Successor Stockholder reconfirmed the agency and power
of attorney conferred by this Section 13.01. All decisions and actions by the
Stockholder Representative (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall
be binding upon all of the Stockholders, and no Stockholder shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) Authority; Indemnification. Each Stockholder agrees that the Purchaser,
Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation shall be fully protected in relying upon
and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no liability to the
Stockholders with respect to any action taken by the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of such Stockholder, pursuant to Section 13.01(b)
above (an "Authorized Action"), and that each Authorized Action shall be
binding on each Stockholder as fully as if such Stockholder had taken such
Authorized Action. The Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that the Stockholder
Representative, as the Stockholder Representative, shall have no liability to
the Purchaser and Merger Sub for any Authorized Action taken in good faith
pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Authorized Action
is found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Each Stockholder (based on such
Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage) hereby severally, for itself only and not
jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative against all fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
any Action to which the Stockholder Representative is made a party by reason
of the fact it is or was acting as the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Exculpation. The Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Stockholder, except
in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Stockholder. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Stockholder
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for
willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the
Stockholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the
Stockholder Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Stockholder to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Stockholders any payment in excess of the amount to which
they are determined to have been entitled. The Stockholder Representative
shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.
Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any agent employed by it shall
incur any liability to any Stockholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of
the Stockholder Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties
hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith.



(e) Upon the Survival Period Termination Date, if there are no open claims to
be resolved with respect to the merger consideration adjustments as set forth
in Article II, and no outstanding claims to be resolved pursuant to Article
IX, the Stockholder Representative will within five (5) business days of such
date obtain reimbursement for any outstanding Representative Expenses for
which it is due reimbursement under this Agreement and for which it has not
been reimbursed prior to such time and distribute any remaining portion of the
Representative Holdback Amount to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis
according to each Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage, it being understood and
agreed that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility of the
Stockholder Representative only and that neither the Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, in fact made or made to the appropriate
Persons or in the appropriate amounts. If there are open claims that remain
unresolved with respect to the purchase price adjustments as set forth in
Article II or outstanding claims that remain unresolved pursuant to Article IX
on the Survival Period Termination Date, the Stockholder Representative will
within five (5) business days after the date of resolution of such claims
obtain reimbursement for any outstanding Representative Expenses for which it
is due reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement and for which it has not been
reimbursed prior to such time and distribute any remaining portion of the
Representative Holdback Amount to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis
according to each Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage, it being understood and
agreed that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility of the
Stockholder Representative only and that neither the Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, in fact made or made to the appropriate
Persons or in the appropriate amounts. The Stockholder Representative may
instruct the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, when making
any payments to the Stockholders, to direct to the Stockholder Representative
sufficient funds from such payments to the Stockholders to increase the
aggregate Representative Account. Such payment to the Stockholder
Representative shall be deducted from the funds otherwise being directed to
the Stockholders, and allocated among the Stockholders on a pro rata basis
according to each Stockholder\'s Residual Percentage, and shall be held in the
Representative Account and shall be used only to pay Representative Expenses
or to reimburse the Stockholder Representative for Representative Expenses
paid by the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement.

Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, or prior to
the Closing any other announcement or communication to the employees,
customers or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by any party
hereto (or any Affiliate to a party hereto) without the joint approval of the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, unless (a) required by Law or by
the rules and regulations, including listing standards, of the NYSE, in which
case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use reasonable
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued to
the extent practicable, or (b) with respect to the Purchaser, for any
customary disclosures for a public company, including pursuant to earnings
calls and in communications with lenders, noteholders, stockholders, credit
rating agencies and analysts, among others.

Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall pay all
of their own expenses (including attorneys\' and accountants\' fees and
expenses) in connection with the negotiation of this



Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the
Purchaser shall pay the Transaction Expenses and Change of Control Payments as
provided in Section 3.02(h); and, provided, further, that the fees, costs and
expenses of the Stockholders and the Company incurred in connection herewith
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be Transaction Expenses.

Knowledge Defined. For purposes of this Agreement, "the Company\'s knowledge",
"the Company acquires knowledge" and "knowledge of the Company" as used herein
shall mean the actual knowledge or conscious awareness of Scott C. Wallace,
Chuck Kirk and Clyde Cornell, in each case after reasonable inquiry of their
respective direct reports at the Company\'s headquarters, and "the
Purchaser\'s knowledge" as used herein shall mean the actual knowledge or
conscious awareness of David Ownby and Peter Brandow, in each case after
reasonable inquiry of the officers, directors and employees of the Purchaser.

Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered,
(b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device) to the number

notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the

or to such other address with respect to a party as such party notifies the
other in writing as above provided.

Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the Purchaser\'s or Merger
Sub\'s rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by such party without the prior written consent of: (a) with
respect to any such assignment or delegation occurring on or prior to the
Closing, the Company; and (b) with respect to any such assignment or
delegation occurring after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative;
provided, however, that the Purchaser or Merger Sub shall be permitted to
assign or delegate any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to the Purchaser or to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of the Purchaser, provided that the Purchaser shall remain
secondarily liable hereunder in the event of any such assignment. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the Company\'s or the Stockholder Representative\'s
rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by the Company or the Stockholder Representative without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser. Any purported assignment or delegation in
violation of the preceding sentences of this Section 13.06 will be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentences of this Section 13.06, this Agreement
will be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

References. The table of contents and the section and other headings and
subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto,
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or
"Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to
this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have
the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "including" or any variation thereof means "including,
without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement
that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately
following it. Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, each defined
term used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when used in its
plural or singular form.

Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any
information set forth in any Schedule or incorporated in any Section of the
Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth in each other Schedule
only to the extent such cross disclosure is reasonably apparent from the
disclosure made on such other Schedule. Nothing in this Agreement or the
Schedules shall be deemed adequate to disclose an



exception to a representation or warranty unless such disclosure on the
Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the Ordinary Course of Business. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract). For purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting
on its behalf posts a document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company and located at http://www.intralinks.com, such document shall be
deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made available" (or any
phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the Company.

Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder Representative.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default.

Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give
any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement.

Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ESCROW AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO
THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.



Purchaser and Merger Sub Deliveries. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub
agrees and acknowledges that all documents or other items delivered or made
available to the Purchaser\'s Representatives shall be deemed to be delivered
or made available, as the case may be, to the Purchaser and Merger Sub for all
purposes hereunder.

Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed agreement
entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic
mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall
re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No
party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail
to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one
of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but all such
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of the
parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.05
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

No Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the
parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their
respective Subsidiaries



and Affiliates that no Non‑Recourse Party of a party to this Agreement shall
have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein except to the extent agreed to in writing by such Non-
Recourse Party.

Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights
of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique
and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non‑breaching party may
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such
non‑breaching party shall be entitled to seek, in addition to any other rights
and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their
rights and the other party\'s obligations hereunder not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security).
