(iii) AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 28, 2016 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between AVENUE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC., a Tennessee corporation
(" _Target_ "), and PINNACLE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, INC., a Tennessee corporation
(" _Acquiror_ ").

 

 _RECITALS_ :

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror and Target have approved, and
deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations
and shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein in which Target will, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, merge with and into Acquiror (the " _Merger_ "), so that
Acquiror is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Acquiror and Target have each determined
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are consistent
with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals;

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to Acquiror
to enter into this Agreement, certain holders of the Targets Common Stock
have entered into a voting agreement with Acquiror dated as of the date
hereof, the form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each a " _Voting
Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which
each such person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of Target
Common Stock owned by such person in favor of the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the parties
intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ "), at the Effective
Time, Target shall merge with and into Acquiror. Acquiror shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Target shall terminate.

(b) The parties may by mutual agreement at any time change the method of
effecting the combination of Target and Acquiror, if and to the extent they
deem such change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or form of Merger Consideration to be
provided to holders of

 



1  Target Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect
the tax treatment of holders of Target Common Stock as a result of receiving
the Merger Consideration or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

1.2 _Effective Time._ The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the " _Tennessee Secretary_ ")
on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time
when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 48-21-108 of the TBCA.

1.4 _Conversion of Target Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Target, Acquiror or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_, each share of the common stock, no par
value per share, of Target (the " _Target Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of
Target Common Stock owned by Target, Acquiror or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Target Common Stock held in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such
shares held in a fiduciary capacity by Target, Acquiror or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "
_Trust Account Shares_ ") and shares of Target Common Stock held on account of
a debt previously contracted (" _DPC Shares_ ")), shall be converted into the
right to receive (i) 0.36 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common
stock, $1.00 par value per share, of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror Common Stock_
") together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 2.2(e)_ of this Agreement (the " _Stock Consideration_
") and (ii) an amount in cash equal to $2.00, without interest (the "
_Cash Consideration_ " and together with the Stock Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). No shares of preferred stock of Acquiror will be
issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) All of the shares of Target Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_  shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing
any such shares of Target Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each
uncertificated share Target Common Stock (each, an " _Uncertificated Share_ ")
registered to a holder of Target Common Stock on the stock transfer books of
Target shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a certificate
representing the Stock Consideration in whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_; and (ii) the Cash Consideration deliverable with respect to the
shares of Target Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share, into which the shares of Target Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share have been converted pursuant to
this  _Section 1.4_ and _Section 2.2(e)_. Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares previously representing shares of Target Common Stock other than shares
of Target Common Stock owned by Target or Acquiror (other than Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be exchanged for (i) certificates
representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock, equal to the Stock
Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares; and (ii)
the Cash Consideration in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificates or transfer of such Uncertificated Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time
and not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, the outstanding shares of
Acquiror Common Stock or Target Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an equitable and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio per share payable pursuant to
this Agreement and the amount of Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



2 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock (as defined below) that
are owned by Target, Acquiror or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other
than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

1.5 _Acquiror Capital Stock._ At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Acquiror Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

1.6 _Options._

(a) Target shall ensure that, (i) prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to acquire shares of Target Common Stock (the " _Target
Stock Options_ ") issued pursuant to Targets equity-based compensation plans
identified in  _Section 4.12(a)_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Target Stock Plans_ "), shall become, subject to Closing, fully vested and
exercisable (without regard to whether the Target Stock Options are then
vested or exercisable), (ii) at the Effective Time all Target Stock Options
not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Cash Out Amount_ ") in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of $20.00 over the exercise price of each
such Target Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Target Common Stock
subject to such option to the extent not previously exercised (such payment,
if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 2.3_),
and (iii) after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Target Stock Option
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Cash Out Amount, without interest.
In the event the exercise price per share of Target Common Stock subject to a
Target Stock Option is equal to or greater than $20.00, such Target Stock
Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further force or
effect.

(b) Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, the Target Stock Plans shall terminate and that no person
shall have any right under the Target Stock Plans, except as set forth herein
(including, to the extent necessary, using reasonable best efforts to obtain
any necessary consents, if any, of the holders of Target Stock Options in
order to give effect to this _Section 1.6_).

 

(c) At or promptly after the Effective Time (which may be in connection with
the payment of the first regular base salary payment due to such holder
following the Closing, and in any event shall occur within thirty (30) days of
the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror Bank shall deliver
the Cash Out Amount to the holders of Target Stock Options, without
interest. 

1.7 Charter

. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, the charter of Acquiror, as then amended (the " _Acquiror Charter_ "),
shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law. 

1.8 _Bylaws._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of Acquiror, as then amended (the " _Acquiror
Bylaws_ "), shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

1.9 _Tax Consequences._ It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

1.10 _Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation._ The officers and
directors of Acquiror as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue as the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 1.11 _Appointment of Target Director to Acquiror s and Acquiror Banks Boards

to the board of directors of Acquiror and Acquirors bank subsidiary (the "
_Acquiror Bank_ ").

 

1.12 _Offices of Acquiror and Target; Headquarters of Surviving Corporation._
From and after the Effective Time, the location of the headquarters and
principal executive offices of the Surviving Corporation shall be 150 Third

1.13 _Approval of Shareholders._ Prior to consummation of the Merger, this
Agreement shall be approved by the shareholders of Target. 

1.14 _Subordinated Notes._ Upon consummation of the Merger, the Surviving

Time Targets obligations under Targets Fixed/Floating Rate Subordinated
Notes due 2024 in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

ARTICLE II.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration._ At or prior to the Closing, Acquiror
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Target and Acquiror (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this  _Article II_ , the Cash Consideration,
certificates (or at Acquirors option, evidence of shares in book entry form)
representing the shares of Acquiror Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares with respect to the
Stock Consideration (such cash and certificates for shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued
pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and _Section
2.2(e)_ in exchange for shares of Target Common Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any other rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common
Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and
hold all dividends and other distributions payable or distributable with
respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration._

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five business days,
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of one or more Certificates or Uncertificated Shares a letter of
transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form as reasonably
agreed by the parties hereto (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss of and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or the transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates to the
Exchange Agent for exchange and cancellation, together with such properly
completed Letter of Transmittal or upon receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) the Merger Consideration that such holder of the
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall have become entitled pursuant to
the provisions of _Article I_; and (ii) a check representing the amount of
any dividends or distributions that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered or the Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated Shares transferred
shall forthwith be

 



4  cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Uncertificated Share with respect to the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or transfer such Uncertificated Share in accordance with this 
_Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate or transfer of an
Uncertificated Share in accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered or the Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated Shares transferred
in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated
Share or Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered or Uncertificated Share or Uncertificated Shares transferred, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Target of the shares of Target Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares
for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Acquiror Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a shareholder of Acquiror. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Acquiror shall pay to each former shareholder of
Target who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing prices
of Acquiror Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), or
such other securities market or stock exchange on which the Acquiror Common
Stock then principally trades, for the ten (10) trading days ending on the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Acquiror. Any former shareholders of Target who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Acquiror for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Acquiror Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Target Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Target, the Target Subsidiary
(as defined below), Acquiror, Acquiror Bank, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Target Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably

 



5  required by Acquiror, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Acquiror may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent, or if the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate
has been returned to Acquiror pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_, Acquiror, will
issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

(h) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred solely by a holder of shares of Target Common Stock in connection
with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder.

2.3 _Withholding._ Each of Acquiror, Target and the Surviving Corporation
is entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Target Common Stock or
Target Stock Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

Except as disclosed in (a), other than with respect to the representations and
warranties in _Section 3.2_,  _Section 3.3(a)_ and _Section 3.7_, the

date hereof, but excluding any risk factors or forward-looking disclosures set
forth under the heading "Risk Factors" or under the heading "Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or any other disclosure that is
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, or (b) the disclosure
schedule (the " _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Acquiror to
Target prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this _Article III_ or to one or more of Acquirors
covenants contained in _Article V_ ,  _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item
is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Acquiror that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect), Acquiror hereby represents and warrants to Target as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization._

 

(a) Acquiror is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Acquiror has the corporate
and other power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, (A) with respect to
Target, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results of
operations, or financial condition of Target and the Target Subsidiary, taken
as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Target to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) with respect to

 



6  Acquiror, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results
of operations, or financial condition of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Acquiror to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that with respect to
clause (A)(i) and (B)(i) the following shall not be deemed to have a Material
Adverse Effect: any change or event caused by or resulting from (I) changes,
after the date hereof, in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates
or other economic or monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere,
(II) changes, after the date hereof, in United States or foreign securities
markets, including changes in price levels or trading volumes, (III) changes
or events, after the date hereof, affecting the financial services industry
generally and not specifically relating to Acquiror or Target or
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (IV) changes, after the
date hereof, in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory
accounting requirements applicable to banks or savings associations and their
holding companies generally, (V) changes, after the date hereof, in laws,
rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by
any Governmental Entity, (VI) actions or omissions of Acquiror or Target taken
with the prior written consent of the other or required hereunder, (VII) the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement thereof, (VIII) any
outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is involved or
any act of terrorism within the United States or directed against its
facilities or citizens wherever located; and provided, further, that in no
event shall a change in the trading prices, or trading volume, of a partys
capital stock, by itself, be considered material or constitute a Material
Adverse Effect, or (IX) the failure by Target or Acquiror to meet any internal
or published industry analyst projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues
or earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (it being
understood that any facts or circumstances giving rise to or contributing to
such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of Material
Adverse Effect may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Material Adverse Effect).

(b) Acquiror is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). True and complete copies
of the Acquiror Charter and Acquiror Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by Acquiror to Target.

 

(c) Each Acquiror Subsidiary, including Acquiror Bank, (i) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is, in the case of Acquiror Bank, a Tennessee state banking
corporation, (iii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in
all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to
be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror and (iv) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except to the extent that the failure to have such power or authority would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. As
used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to
any party means any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting
purposes under GAAP.

 

3.2 _Capitalization._

(a) The authorized capital stock of Acquiror consists of ninety million

Schedule. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Acquiror Capital Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable

encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of
Acquiror has or is bound by any outstanding subscription, option, warrant,
call, commitment or agreement of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

corporate proceedings on the part of Acquiror are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Acquiror and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Target) constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Acquiror, enforceable against Acquiror in

party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound or affected, except in the case of clause (ii) above for such

or regulatory investigations of any nature against Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction (other than those that apply to similarly situated bank holding

Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns._

(a) Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all federal, state,
foreign and local information returns and Tax returns required to be filed by
it on or prior to the date of this Agreement and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or
claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing
authorities other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges that are not
yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith or have not been finally
determined and have been adequately reserved against under GAAP, or (ii)
information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay

10  There are no material disputes pending, or to the knowledge of Acquiror,
claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Acquiror or any of its

and to the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority,
except for failures to so withhold, collect or deposit that are immaterial,
individually and in the aggregate. Acquiror has not been requested to grant,
nor has it granted, any waiver of any federal, state, local or foreign statute
of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for
the assessment of, any Tax, which waiver or extension has not since expired.

transaction" or "tax shelter" within the meaning of the Code requiring it to
file, register, prepare, produce or maintain any disclosure, report, list or
any other statement or document under Sections 6111 or 6112 of the Code.
Acquiror is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means (i)
all federal, state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross
income, ad valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use,
payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties, intangibles, franchise,
backup withholding, and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments

control or fringe benefit plans, programs, arrangements or agreements that
are sponsored by Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or maintained or contributed to,
or required to be contributed to, for the benefit of current or former
directors or employees of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries or with respect to
which Acquiror or its Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, have any
liability to such directors or employees, as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Acquiror Benefit Plans_ ").

 

(b) Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, (i) each of the
Acquiror Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") and the Code, (ii) each of the Acquiror
Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter
(upon which Acquiror is entitled to rely) from the United States Internal
Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") that such Acquiror Benefit Plan is so
qualified, and to the knowledge of Acquiror, there are no existing
circumstances or any events that have occurred that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Acquiror Benefit Plan,
(iii) no material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
Acquiror, its Subsidiaries or any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, all of which together with Acquiror, would be deemed a "single
employer" under Section 4001 of ERISA (an " _Acquiror ERISA Affiliate_ ") that
has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no

qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1  _Regulatory Matters._

(a) Target and Acquiror shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Acquiror shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as
a prospectus. Each of Target and Acquiror shall use their reasonable best
efforts in consultation with their respective legal counsel to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and Target shall thereafter promptly mail or deliver the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders. Acquiror shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Target shall furnish all
information concerning Target and the holders of Target Capital Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. If at any time
prior to or after the Effective Time any information relating to any of the
parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated or made available on the SECs
EDGAR database to the shareholders of Acquiror and mailed or delivered to the
shareholders of Target.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file (and, if
applicable, cause their Subsidiaries to promptly prepare and file) all
necessary documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, waivers,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
or Regulatory Agencies which are reasonably necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Merger and, if Acquiror shall make the request described in
_Section 6.13_, the Bank Merger (as defined herein)), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities, Regulatory Agencies and
third parties; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Acquiror or
Acquiror Bank be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other
requirement which (i) would prohibit or materially limit the ownership
or operation by Target, or by Acquiror or any of their Subsidiaries, of all
or any material portion of the business or assets of Target or Acquiror or any
of their Subsidiaries, (ii) compel Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to
dispose of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Target or
of Acquiror or any of their Subsidiaries or continue any portion of any Target
Regulatory Agreement against Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Merger or (iii) would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on

 



36  Acquiror after giving effect to the Merger (together, the " _Burdensome
Conditions_ "); _provided, further, however_ , that (1) any prohibition,
limitation or other requirement imposed by a Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency which is customarily imposed in published orders or
approvals for transactions such as the Merger (or, if Acquiror shall make the
request described in _Section 6.13_, the Bank Merger) shall not be deemed to
be a Burdensome Condition and (2) prior to declaring a Burdensome Condition
and electing not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as a
result thereof, Acquiror shall, and, if applicable, shall cause Acquiror Bank
to, negotiate in good faith with the relevant Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency to seek a commercially reasonable modification to the
prohibition, limitation or other requirement to reduce the burdensome nature
thereof such that the prohibition, limitation or other requirement no longer
constitutes a Burdensome Condition. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than twenty-five (25)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and
filings required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with the other party hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, waivers, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities or Regulatory
Agencies necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party will keep the others apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.
Acquiror and Target will furnish each other and each others counsel with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as reasonably may be
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
any application, petition or other statement or application made by or on
behalf of Acquiror (and, if applicable, Acquiror Bank) or Target to any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror and Target shall have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other
on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to Acquiror or Target, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
will provide the other with copies of any applications, notices, petitions
or filings, and all correspondence relating thereto, prior to filing, other
than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain
information filed under a claim of confidentiality (except for the Interagency
Bank Merger Act Application) and, in each case, subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information.

(c) Target and Acquiror shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Target, Acquiror or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Acquiror and Target
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, (i) that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading and (ii) that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Target Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any
statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statement
was made, not misleading. Each of Acquiror and Target further agrees that if
it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of
the statements in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 



37 (d) Target and Acquiror shall promptly advise each other upon their (or their
Subsidiaries) receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained, that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed or that a Burdensome Condition might be imposed on any such
Requisite Regulatory Approval.

 

(e) Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
Acquiror and Target shall promptly furnish each other with copies of written
communications received by Acquiror or Target (or their Subsidiaries) or
delivered by Acquiror or Target (or their Subsidiaries), to any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement (as defined herein).

6.2 _Access to Information._

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, Target shall, and shall cause the Target Subsidiary
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of Acquiror, reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of Targets and the
Target Subsidiarys properties, books, contracts, commitments and records
and, during such period, Target shall, and shall cause the Target Subsidiary
to, make available to Acquiror (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which Target or the Target
Subsidiary is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all
other information concerning Targets and the Target Subsidiarys business,
properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request. Neither Target
nor the Target Subsidiary shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of their customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege attached to such information or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) The Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated as of January 11, 2016, entered
into by and between Acquiror and Target (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
will remain in full force and effect following the date of this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger occurs, in accordance with the terms thereof;
provided, however, that, effective as of the Effective Time, all confidential
information of Target will be deemed to be "Confidential Information" of
Acquiror and will be subject to the protections set forth therein for the
benefit of Acquiror.

 

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other party or parties set forth herein.

6.3 _Shareholder Approval._

 

(a) Target shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Target
Charter and bylaws of Target, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Target Shareholders  Meeting_") to be held as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective for the
purpose of Targets shareholders voting upon proposals to adopt and approve
this Agreement and the Merger. The board of directors of Target shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Target the vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby required by the TBCA, the Target Charter and bylaws of Target,
including (subject to the ability of Targets board of directors to take
actions permitted under _Section 6.10_) by communicating to its shareholders
its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) that the shareholders approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (such approval the " _Target Shareholder
Approval_ ").

 



38 (b) Target shall adjourn or postpone the Target Shareholders Meeting if, (i)
as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Target Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or (ii) if on the date of such meeting Target has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of Target at the Target Shareholders Meeting
for the purpose of Targets shareholders voting on the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Target of such obligations.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._ Target and Acquiror shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity or Regulatory Agency and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Acquiror or Target in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Quotation or Listing._ Acquiror shall cause the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be qualified for
quotation or listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements._

 

(a) Within one year following the Effective Time (but in the case of the
Acquirors 401(k) Plan beginning with the first full payroll period that
commences following the Effective Time or as soon thereafter as
administratively practicable), to the extent permissible under the terms of
the Acquiror Benefit Plans and the cash and equity incentive plans of Acquiror
(the " _Acquiror Incentive Plans_ "), the employees of Target and the Target
Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the " _Target Employees_ ") will be
eligible to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans and Acquiror
Incentive Plans in which similarly situated employees of Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent as similarly situated employees
of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of Target
Employees in the Acquiror Benefit Plans and the Acquiror Incentive Plans may
occur at different times with respect to different plans) except as provided
below.

 

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable legal requirements, the
employees of Target and the Target Subsidiary employed by Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
shall, for a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time (the " _Protected Period_ "), be entitled to the same or better annual
salary or hourly wages to which the Continuing Employees were entitled on the
Closing Date.

(c) With regard to Target Employees identified on _Schedule 6.6(c)_ , and to
the extent that during the Protected Period a Continuing Employee other than a
Target Employee identified on _Schedule 6.6(c)_ is terminated without cause,
Acquiror or Acquiror Bank shall pay or cause to be paid, severance pay in an
amount equal to the amounts set forth on _Schedule 6.6(c)_. For purposes of
this _Section 6.6_, "cause" shall have the same meaning as provided in any
written employment agreement between any Continuing Employee and Acquiror or
any Affiliate of Acquiror on the date such Continuing Employee is terminated,
or if no such definition or employment agreement exists, "cause" shall mean
conduct amounting to (1) fraud or dishonesty against Acquiror or any
Affiliate of Acquiror; (2) the Continuing Employees willful misconduct,
repeated refusal to follow the reasonable directions of the Acquirors board
of directors or knowing violation of law in the course of performance of the
duties of the Continuing Employees service with Acquiror or any Affiliate of
Acquiror; (3) repeated absences from work without a reasonable excuse; (4)
repeated intoxication with alcohol or drugs while on the premises of Acquiror
or any Affiliate of Acquiror during regular business hours; (5) a conviction
or

 



39  plea of guilty or NOLO CONTENDERE to a felony or a crime involving
dishonesty; or (6) a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement to
which the Continuing Employee and Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror are
party.

(d) With respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is an "employee benefit
plan," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, and entitlement to benefits, including for
severance benefits and vacation entitlement, but not for purposes of benefit
accrual, service with Target or the Target Subsidiary shall be treated as
service with Acquiror and its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall to the extent
permissible under the terms of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and as permitted by
the applicable insurer, apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any
preexisting condition limitations. Each Acquiror Benefit Plan shall to the
extent permissible under the terms of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and as
permitted by the applicable insurer, waive pre-existing condition limitations
to the same extent waived under the applicable Target Benefit Plan. Target
Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit
plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Acquiror Benefit Plans and to the extent
permissible by the applicable insurer.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, will assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance, change of control and other compensation agreements and
arrangements between Target or the Target Subsidiary and any of their
employees (that are listed on _Section 6.6(e)_ of the Target
Disclosure Schedule), which are not terminated in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
accrued and vested benefit obligations through the Effective Time which are
between Target or the Target Subsidiary and any of their current or former
directors, officers, employees or consultants.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or
Acquiror Bank, as applicable, will, and will cause any applicable Acquiror
Benefit Plan to, provide or pay when due to the Target Employees all benefits
and compensation pursuant to Target Benefit Plans in effect on the
date hereof earned or accrued through, and to which such individuals are
entitled, as of the Effective Time (or such later time as such Target Benefit
Plans as in effect at the Effective Time are terminated or canceled by
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror Bank) subject to compliance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(g) At the Effective Time, Target shall, and shall cause the Target
Subsidiary to, cease contributions to and terminate Targets 401(k) Plan, and
shall (a) adopt written resolutions (a copy of which shall be delivered to
Acquiror at the Closing) to terminate the 401(k) Plan and 100% vest all
participants under the 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) deliver to
Acquiror, prior to the Closing, notice of the 401(k) Plan termination to any
trustees and custodians of the 401(k) Plan and/or its assets. Acquiror
reserves the right to suspend the distribution of benefits from the 401(k)
Plan until the later of the receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS with respect to the termination of the 401(k) Plan and the completion
of final testing and record keeping for the 401(k) Plan.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer or employee of Target or the Target Subsidiary, or who is or was
serving at the request of Target or the Target Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another person, including any entity specified
in the Target Disclosure Schedule (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or 

 



40  pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee
of Target or the Target Subsidiary or any of their predecessors or is or was
serving at the request of Target or the Target Subsidiary or any of their
predecessors as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each such Indemnified
Party to the same extent as such Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Target or the Target
Subsidiary pursuant to the Target Charter, Targets bylaws, the charter and
bylaws of the Target Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date hereof (copies of which have been provided to
Acquiror) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking (in
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by Target (provided, that Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of Target and the Target Subsidiary arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided,_ _however_ , that Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis,
an amount in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the
date hereof by Target for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance which, in Acquirors and the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Target, in consultation
with Acquiror, may (and at the request of Acquiror, Target shall use its
reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time,
at Acquirors expense, a six-year "tail" policy under Targets existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) In the event Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as appropriate, assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements._ In case at any time before or after the Effective
Time any further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by the other parties to this Agreement.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes._ Target and Acquiror shall promptly advise the other
of any fact, change, event or circumstance (i) that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it

 



41  believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give
rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in
_Article VII_ ; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; provided further that a failure to comply with
this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set
forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying fact, change,
event or circumstance would independently result in the failure of a condition
set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or provide a basis for terminating
this Agreement. 

6.10 _Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation._

 

(a) Target and the Target Subsidiary and each of their affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by Target or the Target Subsidiary (each a " _Target Representative_
")) shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 6.10(b)_, from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, Target shall not, and shall cause the Target Subsidiary not to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any Target Representative to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action designed to solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions, negotiations or other communications regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any
Target Representative, whether or not such Target Representative is so
authorized and whether or not such Target Representative is purporting to act
on behalf of Target or the Target Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by Target.

 

(b)

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of Target shall be
permitted, prior to the Target Shareholders Meeting, to engage in discussions
and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any
person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
by such person made after the date of this Agreement which its board of
directors concludes in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal if and only to the extent that the board of
directors of Target concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside legal counsel and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that failure to take such actions would result in violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and subject to compliance with the
other terms of this _Section 6.10_; _provided, however_ , that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, Target shall have provided notice to Acquiror of its
intention to provide such information, and shall have provided such
information to Acquiror if not previously provided to Acquiror, and shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall include customary non-disclosure, confidentiality, standstill
and non-solicitation and no-hire provisions and not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with Target.

(ii) In addition to the obligations of Target under  _Section 6.10(d)_,
Target shall notify Acquiror promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to Target or the Target Subsidiary that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any person
seeking to have discussions, negotiations or other communications relating to
a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and
confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making
the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers (including a copy
thereof if in 

 



42  writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Target shall also
promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, notify Acquiror, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions, negotiations or other communications
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data
to any person in accordance with this _Section 6.10(b)_ and keep Acquiror
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions
or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

 

(iii) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit Target or the
Target Subsidiary from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way
limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has
under any other provision of this Agreement.

(c) Target agrees that (i) it will and will cause the Target Subsidiary
and the Target Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it
will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or the Target Subsidiary
is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Targets board
of directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or
qualify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or
qualify), in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of Acquiror, its
recommendation referred to in _Section 6.3(a)_, or (ii) approve or recommend
(or publicly propose to approve or recommend or announce its intention to
approve, recommend or propose) any Acquisition Proposal (either (i) or (ii),
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, Target shall not, and Targets board of directors
shall not allow Target to, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before obtaining the Target
Shareholder Approval, Targets board of directors may, if it determines in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel and with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that the failure to do
so would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
Acquiror under this _Section 6.10(d)_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided that Target may not make any Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Acquisition Proposal unless (x) Target shall not have breached
_Section 6.3_ or this _Section 6.10_ in any material respect and (y):

(i) within three (3) business days after notice to Acquiror of receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, Targets board of directors determines in good faith
(after receiving advice from its outside legal counsel and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been
withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account
all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
Acquiror under this _Section 6.10(d)_;

(ii) Target has given Acquiror at least ten (10) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal)) and has
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the person making such Superior Proposal;

 

(iii) Before effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, Target has
negotiated, and has caused Target Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Acquiror during the ten (10) business day notice period described in
_Section 6.10(d)(ii)_ to the extent Acquiror wishes to negotiate, to enable
Acquiror to revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



43 (iv) Targets board of directors, following the final of such ten (10) (or
five (5), as applicable) business day period (as described below) again
determines in good faith (after receiving advice from its outside legal
counsel and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that
such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
Target shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Acquiror a new written
notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and Target shall be required
to comply with its obligations under this _Section 6.10(d)_ with respect to
such new written notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice
shall be reduced to five (5) business days (rather than the ten (10) business
days referenced in clause (ii) above).

(e) Subject to _Section 8.1(j)_ (and in that case, only if Target shall have
complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section 6.3_
and this _Section 6.10_), nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall permit Target
to terminate this Agreement or affect any other obligation of Target under
this Agreement. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Target shall not
submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the
Merger.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion
of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Target, (x) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity securities
representing 20% or more of the voting power of any class of
equity securities of Target or the Target Subsidiary or 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of Target, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of the
voting power of any class of equity securities of Target or the Target
Subsidiary, or (z) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Target or the Target Subsidiary, in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which the board of directors of Target concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the shareholders of
Target from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being
fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental
approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this
definition of Superior Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.10(f)_ except that the reference
to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be a reference to "50% or more."

6.11 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information._ As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
hereof, Target will furnish to Acquiror (a) consolidated financial statements
of Target (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
shareholders equity) (to the extent available) as of and for such month then
ended, (b) internal management reports showing actual financial performance
against plan and previous period, and (c) to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any reports provided to Targets board of directors or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of
Target and the Target Subsidiary.

 



44 6.12 _Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)._ Prior to the Effective
Time, Acquiror and Target shall each take such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Target Common Stock and
Target Stock Options by shareholders or optionholders of Target in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.13 _Bank Merger. _ At or prior to the Effective Time, if requested by
Acquiror, Target shall cause the Target Subsidiary to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ") with Acquiror Bank
pursuant to which the Target Subsidiary shall merge with and into Acquiror
Bank (the " _Bank Merger_ ") at or following the Effective Time. Promptly
following execution of such Bank Merger Agreement, Target shall approve such
agreement as the sole shareholder of the Target Subsidiary. The Bank Merger
Agreement shall contain such terms and conditions as are reasonable, normal
and customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby including a
covenant that consummation of the merger of the Target Subsidiary with and
into Acquiror Bank would not occur earlier than simultaneous with consummation
of the Merger and a provision for termination of the Bank Merger Agreement
upon termination of this Agreement.

 

6.14 _Exchange Matters._ Prior to the Closing Date, Target shall cooperate
with Acquiror and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies
of Nasdaq to enable the delisting of the shares of Target Common Stock
from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the shares of Target Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the

(a) by mutual consent of Acquiror and Target in a written instrument, if the
board of directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its respective entire board of directors;

(b) by either Acquiror or Target, if a Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Agency that must provide Acquiror or Target with a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger (or, if applicable, the Bank
Merger) and such denial has become final and non-appealable, or any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other

 



47  action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger (or, if applicable, the Bank Merger), and such order, decree, ruling or
other action has become final and non-appealable; _provided, however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not
be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such action;

(c) by either Acquiror or Target, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before September 30, 2016; _provided, however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date;

(d) by either Acquiror or Target (provided that, if Target is the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement, it shall not be in material breach of any
of its obligations under _Section 6.3_ and _Section 6.10_), if any approval
of the shareholders of Target required for the consummation of the Merger
shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at the Target

(e) by either Acquiror or Target (provided that Acquiror, in the event of
termination by Acquiror, or Target, in the event of termination by Target, is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by Acquiror (in
the event of termination by Target) or by Target (in the event of termination
by Acquiror), which breach is not cured within thirty days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing; _provided,_ _however_ , that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(e)_ unless the breach of a representation or warranty, together
with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such
representation or warranty not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under _Section 7.2(a)_ (in the case of a breach of a representation or
warranty by Acquiror) or  _Section 7.3(a)_ (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by Target);

of termination by Target) or by Target (in the event of termination by
Acquiror), which breach shall not have been cured within thirty
days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; _provided,
however,_ that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(f)_ unless the breach of covenant or
agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
entitled to the benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby under  _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section
7.2(c)_ (in the case of a breach of covenant or agreement by Acquiror) or
_Section 7.3(b)_ (in the case of a breach of covenant or agreement by
Target);

 

(g) by Acquiror if (i) the board of directors of Target does not publicly
recommend in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that Targets shareholders
approve and adopt this Agreement, (ii) after recommending in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that Targets shareholders approve and adopt this
Agreement, the board of directors of Target shall have effected any
Adverse Recommendation Change, or (iii) Target materially breaches its
obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to prepare and mail to
its shareholders the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or a failure to call a meeting
of its shareholders in accordance with _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ ,
respectively;

(h) by Acquiror, if the board of directors of Target has
authorized, recommended, or publicly announced its intention to authorize or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal with any persons other than Acquiror or if
Target otherwise breaches, in any material respect, its obligations under

with _Section 8.3_.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) or (j) of this _Section 8.1_ shall give written

to this Agreement or their respective officers or directors, except (A) with
respect to _Sections 6.2(b)_ , _8.2_ , and _8.3_ and _Article IX_ , which
shall survive such termination and (B) notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to any liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful and
material breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

8.3 _Termination Fee._

 

(a) Target shall pay Acquiror, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the sum of $8,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement
is terminated as follows:

this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 8.1(g)_  or _8.1(h)_ ), then Target
shall pay the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination;

(ii) if (A) either Acquiror or Target shall terminate this Agreement pursuant

and at or before the Target Shareholders Meeting a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced by or otherwise communicated or
made known to senior management or to the board of directors of Target (a "
_Public Proposal_ "), which has not been withdrawn prior to the date of the
termination of this Agreement, and within nine (9) months of the date of such
termination of this Agreement Target enters into a definitive agreement with

termination and within nine (9) months of the date of such termination of this
Agreement Target enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then Target shall pay the Termination Fee
on the earlier of the date of Targets execution of such definitive agreement
or consummation of such Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) if Target shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_.

 

For purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)_, all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(b) If Target fails to pay the Termination Fee payable under this _Section
8.3_ on the dates specified, then Target shall pay all costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Acquiror in
connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit)
taken by Acquiror to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in the Wall Street Journal, from the date such amounts were required
to be paid until the date actually received.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge (i) that the agreements contained in _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, (ii)
that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement and (iii) except in the event of fraud or a termination of this
Agreement resulting from the willful or intentional breach in any material
respect of this Agreement by Target, the Termination Fee provided for in
_Section 8.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Acquiror in
the event of the termination of this Agreement in any of the manners
stipulated in _Section 8.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by Target under this _Section 8.3_ shall be equal to
the Termination Fee and in no event shall Target be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

9.5 _Interpretation._ The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, Target
Disclosure Schedule and each other Exhibit and Schedule hereto shall be deemed
part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Whenever the singular or plural form of any word is used
in this Agreement, such word shall encompass both the singular and plural form
of such word. As used in this Agreement, the " _knowledge_ " of Target means
the actual knowledge of any of the officers of Target listed on _Section 9.5_
of the Target Disclosure Schedule, and the " _knowledge_ " of Acquiror means
the actual knowledge of any of the officers of Acquiror listed on _Section
9.5_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule. As used herein, (i) " _business day_
" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banks in
New York, New York or Nashville, Tennessee are authorized by law or executive
order to be closed, (ii) the term " _person_ " means any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,

organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature and
(iii) an " _affiliate_ " of a specified person is any person that directly or
indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such
specified person. Any document or item will be deemed "delivered," "provided"
or "made available" within the meaning of this Agreement if such document or
item is (i) made available specifically for review in person by the other
party or (ii) contained and accessible for a continuous period of at least
forty-eight hours immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (if to
be delivered, provided or made available prior to the date hereof) or the

in the electronic data room hosted by Firmex established by Target in
connection with the transactions

 



51  contemplated hereby to which Acquiror and its designated representatives had
access rights during such period or the online portal used by Acquiror to make
information available to its board of directors to which Target and its
designated representatives had access rights during such period.

9.6 _Amendment._ Subject to compliance with applicable law and _Section
1.1(b)_, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of Target; _provided, however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Target,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the
consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of Target Common Stock,
other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

9.7 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective board of directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided, however_ , that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of Target, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to
be delivered to the holders of Target Common Stock hereunder, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

9.8 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

9.9 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

9.10 _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles, except to the extent mandatory
provisions of federal law apply. Any legal action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement by one party against any other party shall be brought only
in a court of record of, or in any federal court located in, that county in
the State of Tennessee in which the principal executive office of such other
party is located, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue for such
purpose. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, the parties hereby
accept for themselves, and in respect of their property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts and waive
any objection to the laying of venue on the grounds of forum non convenience
which they may now or hereafter have to the bringing or maintaining of any
such action or proceeding in such jurisdiction.

 

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF 

 



52  ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS  _SECTION 9.11_.

9.12 _Publicity._ Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the rules
of Nasdaq or as such party shall determine is advisable under the rules and
regulations of the SEC, neither Target nor Acquiror shall, or shall permit any
of their respective Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior consent of Acquiror, in the case of a proposed
announcement or statement by Target, or Target, in the case of a
proposed announcement or statement by Acquiror, which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

9.13 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries._ Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party hereto.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in 
_Section 6.7_, and, from and after the Effective Time, but only if the
Effective Time shall occur, except for the rights of holders of Target Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Article II_, and
the rights of holders of Target

Stock Options under _Section 1.7_, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any
other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.14 _Severability._ Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission._ This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or

 



53  e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation
of a contract, and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

 

9.16 _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
