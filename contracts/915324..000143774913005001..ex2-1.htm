commence the Offer) to comply with its obligations under the first sentence of
Section 2.02(a).

  

  

(b) The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of shares of
Company Stock which, together with the shares beneficially owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary (if any), represents at least two-thirds of the Company
Stock then outstanding (the "Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the satisfaction,
or waiver, to the extent permissible, by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, of the
other conditions and requirements set forth in Exhibit A (together with the
Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). The Offer Price payable in respect
of each share of Company Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes thereon, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer to
Purchase.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth
in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in
whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition), to
increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that unless previously approved in
writing by the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer
Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the
conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a
manner adverse in any material respect to any stockholders of the Company, (v)
except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.01, terminate, extend or
otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material
respect to any stockholders of the Company.

  

  

(d) The Offer shall expire on the later of (i) 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on May 30, 2013 and (ii) midnight, New York City time, on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the
"Initial Expiration Time") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has
been extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer
has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time
to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this
Agreement, is referred to as the "Expiration Time").

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and without
limiting Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's obligations under this Section
2.01(e), Merger Subsidiary (i) may, in its sole discretion, without the
consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions if on any
then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions shall not be
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, in Merger Subsidiary's sole
discretion, waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are
satisfied or so waived, (ii) shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary
to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company beyond any then-scheduled
Expiration Time, if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer, any
of the Offer Conditions (other than clauses (b), (c) or (d) of Exhibit A)
shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permissible, in Merger Subsidiary's
sole discretion, waived, (iii) shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary
to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or Nasdaq (including, in accordance with
the position of the staff of the SEC, any required extension of the Offer to
ensure that at least five (5) Business Days will remain in the Offer following
disclosure of the satisfaction or waiver of the Funding Condition) applicable
to the Offer and (iv) may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the
Company, extend the Offer if the Marketing Period has not ended (or will not
end) prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Time, from time to time and on one
or more occasions until the first (1st) Business Day immediately following the
final day of the Marketing Period (or such earlier date specified by Parent to
the Company upon two (2) Business Days prior written notice); provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or Merger Subsidiary be required to
extend (or cause to extend) the Offer (A) beyond July 28, 2013, but extended
to September 26, 2013 if as of such date the only Offer Condition not
satisfied is clause (g) on Exhibit A (and each other clause on Exhibit A that
is not satisfied as a result of clause (g) on Exhibit A not being satisfied)
(the "Outside Date") or (B) at any time that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article 11. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Merger Subsidiary may from time to time, in its
sole discretion, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one
or more occasions if (x) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have waived the
Funding Condition, (y) all of the other Offer Conditions (other than the
Minimum Condition) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, in
Merger Subsidiary's sole discretion, waived at such time and (z) the Debt
Financing has not actually been received by Merger Subsidiary or Parent. Each
extension of the Offer (other than pursuant to clause (ii) of the first
sentence of this Section 2.01(e)) shall, subject to Applicable Law, not exceed
the lesser of ten (10) Business Days and such fewer number of days that Merger
Subsidiary reasonably believes are necessary to cause the Offer Conditions to
be satisfied (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and
Parent), and each extension of the Offer pursuant to clause (ii) of the first
sentence of this Section 2.01(e) shall, subject to Applicable Law, be five (5)
Business Days (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company and
Parent).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, accept and,
within three (3) Business Days following such acceptance of shares, pay for
(subject to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 3.06) all shares of
Company Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly after the Expiration Time. Acceptance for payment of shares of
Company Stock following the Expiration Time pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Closing". Nothing contained in this Section 2.01 shall affect any
termination rights in Article 11.

  

  

(g) The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Expiration Time unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 11.01. If at any
then-scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer, (i) each Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, in Merger Subsidiary's sole discretion, waived, (ii) the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied and (iii) no further extensions or re-
extensions of the Offer are permitted or required pursuant to Section 2.01(e),
then Merger Subsidiary shall promptly, irrevocably and unconditionally,
terminate the Offer in accordance with Applicable Law. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Subsidiary, or this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 11.01, Merger Subsidiary shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Subsidiary to return,
all tendered shares of Company Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

(h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer
Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary all information concerning the Company that is reasonably requested
by Parent, or is required by the Exchange Act or other Applicable Law, to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to cause
the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by Applicable Law. Parent and Merger Subsidiary further agree to
cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer
Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC with respect to the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding in
writing to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the Company and its representatives a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give reasonable consideration
to any such comments.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary, on or
before such time as Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to pay for shares of
Company stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Stock that Merger
Subsidiary becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

  

  

Section 2.02 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable following (but in any event on the same day as) the
filing of the Offer Documents with the SEC, the Company shall file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.03,
contain (i) the recommendation described in Section 5.02, (ii) a copy of the
opinion referenced in Section 5.25 in its entirety, together with a summary
thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange
Act, whether or not such item is applicable and (iii) such other information
that is customarily included therein, as mutually determined by Parent and the
Company. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the extent
requested by the Company, Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed
or otherwise disseminated to the stockholders of the Company together with the
Offer Documents disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Subsidiary that is reasonably requested by the
Company, or is required by the Exchange Act or other Applicable Law, to be set
forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by Applicable Law. The Company further agrees
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent and Merger Subsidiary upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Subsidiary with
copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand and prior to the filing of the Schedule
14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding in
writing to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the
Company shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their representatives a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or
response, and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such
comments. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company
Board Recommendation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Merger Subsidiary mailing labels, security
position listings and any other available listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record holders or beneficial owners
of the shares of Company Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Subsidiary with such information and
assistance (including lists of record holders or beneficial owners of the
shares of Company Stock, updated from time to time upon Parent's, Merger
Subsidiary's or either of their respective agent's request, and the addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record holders or
beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Subsidiary or its agent may reasonably
request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and
beneficial owners of the shares of Company Stock. Subject to the requirements
of Applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
and shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
agents and representatives to deliver) to the Company (or destroy) all copies
and any extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or
control.

  

  

Section 2.03 Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Subsidiary an irrevocable option (the
"Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 2.03 following the Offer Closing, to purchase at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of duly
authorized, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Stock (the "Top-Up
Shares") equal to at least that number of shares of Company Stock that, when
added to the number of shares of Company Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute
one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately
after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a fully diluted basis (which
assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities convertible or
exercisable into shares of Company Stock regardless of the conversion or
exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof);
provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) for a
number of shares of Company Stock in excess of the shares of Company Stock
authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as treasury
stock as unissued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect
to the shares of Company Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock
options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Stock
as if such shares were outstanding) and (ii) if the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares are prohibited by any
Applicable Law or Order. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in
whole but not in part, at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to
the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If, immediately following the Offer Closing (and giving effect to the
Offer Closing), the number of shares of Company Stock owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries constitutes less than 90% of the shares of Company Stock
outstanding at such time, then Merger Subsidiary shall exercise the Top-Up
Option subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.03 by delivering
to the Company written notice specifying the number of shares of the Company
Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving
effect to the Offer Closing). The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice (and, in any event, on the same day), deliver
written notice to Merger Subsidiary specifying, based on the information
provided by Merger Subsidiary in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be
purchased by Merger Subsidiary. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, if
applicable, to take place at the same place, on the same day and immediately
prior to the Closing. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the
aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Subsidiary to the Company for the Top-
Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parent's election, either (i)
entirely in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by (A) paying in
cash by wire transfer of same-day funds an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to
the preceding clause (A) (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i)
shall bear simple interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, (ii) shall mature on
the first anniversary of the date of execution of the Promissory Note, (iii)
shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, (iv) may be prepaid,
at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and (v) shall
have no other material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued to Merger
Subsidiary a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company
does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number of book-entry
shares and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the issuance of such
book-entry shares. Such certificates or book-entry shares may include any
legends that are required by Applicable Laws.

  

  

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act and
that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger
Subsidiary is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an
"accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Merger Subsidiary agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Merger Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Stock as a
result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in
any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 3.04.

  

  

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company agrees that it shall maintain out of its existing authorized capital
stock, free from preemptive rights, 55,000,000 authorized but unissued shares
of Company Stock issuable as Top-Up Shares pursuant to this Section 2.03.

  

  

Section 2.04 Notices of Guaranteed Delivery. For purposes of this Agreement
(including Exhibit A, the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the Offer), any
shares of Company Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer subject to notices of
guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer
unless and until the shares of Company Stock underlying such notices of
guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Merger Subsidiary, except
as otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

Section 3.01 The Merger.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Kelley Drye and Warren LLP, 333 W. Wacker, Suite 2600, Chicago, Illinois
60606, as soon as practicable following (and in any event, on the same day as)
the Offer Closing (and, if applicable, the consummation of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares), subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing); provided, however, that if the Company Stockholder Approval is
required by Applicable Law, then the Closing shall take place on the later of
(x) two (2) Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article
10 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver
of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived and (y) the first (1st) Business Day immediately following
the final day of the Marketing Period (but subject to the satisfaction or, to
the extent permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 10 at
the Closing) or such earlier date during the Marketing Period specified in
writing by Parent to the Company upon two (2) Business Days' prior notice;
provided, further, that Parent and the Company may mutually agree to effect
the Closing at any other place, at any other time or on any other date as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree (such date on which the Closing
occurs, the "Closing Date").

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and/or Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger in customary form and substance with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or
at such later time as may be mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent and
as specified in the certificate of merger).

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  

  

Section 3.02 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Subsidiary or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Subsidiary:

  

  

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04, each
share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and as of the Effective Time, all such shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of the Company, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 3.03 Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company
Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, the In-the-Money Company Stock Option Merger
Consideration or the Company RSU Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
In-the-Money Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, respectively, which will
be paid in accordance with Section 3.05). All cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent may not be used for any purpose not provided in this Agreement, or as
otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time. Any
income from investment of the cash deposited with the Exchange Agent will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise directed by Parent.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to send to each holder of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any
Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or holders of
Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of
appraisal) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
promptly following (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall represent from and after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest
or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificate and Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the
terms herein shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares formerly represented by such Certificate and
Uncertificated Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay in advance
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 3.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent or delivered to the Surviving Corporation, as directed by Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to the Parent and the Surviving Corporation as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect
of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon
demand.

  

  

Section 3.04 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section
3.02(b)) and held by a holder who has properly demanded appraisal rights of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares being
referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal
rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled
to payment of the "fair value" of such shares in accordance with Delaware Law;
provided that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to
Delaware Law, such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02(a), without interest thereon,
upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or
transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with
Section 3.03. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands under Delaware Law consistent with the obligations of the Company
thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, except with the prior written consent
of Parent in its sole discretion, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the
Surviving Company or of a stockholder of Parent.

Section 3.05 Company Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as
practicable (but, in any event, prior to the Effective Time) take or cause to
be taken all such actions necessary or appropriate in its good faith
determination (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain written
acknowledgements from each holder of Company Stock Options to the cancellation
of such holder's Company Stock Options in accordance with the terms of this
Section 3.05(a)), or as Parent reasonably requests, so that each option to
purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan (a
"Company Stock Option") that does not, by its terms, expire on or before the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Stock in respect of Company Stock
Options that shall have then been exercised), regardless of whether such
Company Stock Option is vested or would vest prior to or on the Effective
Time, is:

  

  

(i) fully vested and exercised (including exercises contingent upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (however described) and
exercise where payment of the exercise price is funded by a portion of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock issued
upon such exercise); or

  

  

(ii) otherwise canceled without any shares of Company Stock being issued or
outstanding or deemed to be issued or outstanding immediately prior the
Effective Time in respect thereof and converted into the right to receive a
cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
(the "Option Exercise Price") as described in Section 3.06.

  

  

(b) For each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has an Option Exercise Price that is less than the Merger
Consideration (each such Company Stock Option, an "In-the-Money Company Stock
Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess of
the Merger Consideration over the Option Exercise Price of such In-the-Money
Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such In-the-Money Company Stock Option (such amount, the "In-the-Money Company
Stock Option Merger Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay through the Company's payroll (to the extent applicable)
the In-the-Money Company Stock Option Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days after the Effective Time) and the Company shall cooperate
with Parent prior to the Effective Time to arrange for such payment at such
time through payroll. Each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that has an Option Exercise Price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested,
shall be cancelled without any consideration payable therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as
practicable (but, in any event, prior to the Effective Time) take or cause to
be taken all such actions necessary or appropriate in its good faith
determination (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain written
acknowledgements from each holder of Company RSUs to the cancellation of such
holder's Company RSUs in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.05(c)),
or as reasonably requested by Parent, so that each restricted share unit with
respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a
"Company RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether earned or unearned, vested or unvested, shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to (A) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (which for unearned, performance-based Company
RSUs shall be equal to the target number of shares of Company Stock subject to
each such award of performance-based Company RSUs) multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration (such amount, the "Company RSU Merger Consideration").
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the Company's
payroll (to the extent applicable) the Company RSU Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time) and the Company
shall cooperate with Parent prior to the Effective Time to arrange for such
payment at such time through payroll.

  

  

(d) The holders of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs shall have the right
to enforce, and shall be beneficiaries with respect to, the provisions of this
Section 3.05.

  

  

Section 3.06 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax
law. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assist Parent and
the Surviving Corporation in making such deductions and withholdings as
reasonably requested by Parent. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Options or
Company RSUs or any other Person, as applicable, in respect of which the
Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.07 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of a written indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.

  

  

Section 3.08 Adjustments. The Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Stock occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing; provided, however, that this Section 3.08
shall not be deemed to constitute a consent for the Company to take any
prohibited actions set forth in Section 7.01, nor shall it constitute a waiver
of any breach thereof.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Subject to Section 12.05, except as set forth in (a) the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (b) the Company SEC Documents (other than any disclosures
contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements") filed on or after April 29, 2012 and at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (it being acknowledged and
agreed that clause (b) shall not apply to any representations or warranties
set forth in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.05, 5.06, 5.07, 5.08, 5.09 and 5.24), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.01 Corporate Existence and Power.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate
powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as currently conducted, except for
those powers, licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and (where applicable) is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy
of its and each of its Subsidiaries' certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or similar governing documents).

  

  

Section 5.02 Corporate Authorization.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement

(including the Offer, the Merger and the Top-Up Option) are within the
Company's corporate powers and, except for the Company Stockholder Approval
(if required by Applicable Law), have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and, except for the Company
Stockholder Approval (if required by Applicable Law), no other corporate
actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer, the Merger and the Top-Up Option). The
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock (if required by Applicable Law) is the only vote of the holders
of any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity).

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held at which all of the directors were
present (in person or by teleconference), the Company Board has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) authorized, adopted, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer, the Merger and the
Top-Up Option), (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company's stockholders
accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Stock in the Offer and,
unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of Delaware
Law as contemplated by Section 7.02, adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation") (it being
understood that nothing in this clause (iii) shall in any way limit the
Company's and the Company Board's rights under Section 7.03), and (iv)
directed that, unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253
of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 7.02, this Agreement be submitted
to the Company's stockholders for their adoption at a stockholders' meeting
duly called and held for such purpose. As of the date hereof, none of the
aforesaid resolutions have been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn.
Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall make available to Parent
a true and complete copy of the aforementioned resolutions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 5.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no consent, approval,
authorization, waiver, permit or other action by or in respect of or filing
with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the filing of a certificate
of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, (c) compliance with the provisions of the
Communications Laws, including receipt of the FCC Grant, (d) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any
other applicable state or federal securities laws, (e) compliance with any
applicable rules of Nasdaq and (f) any additional actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.04 Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) assuming the Company Stockholder
Approval (if required by Applicable Law to consummate the Merger) is obtained,
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the
organizational or governing documents of any of the Company's Subsidiaries,
(b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Applicable Law, (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.03, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default or breach, or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach, under, or cause
or permit the termination, cancellation, amendment, acceleration or other
change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign entity and (where applicable) is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) All of the outstanding capital stock of or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (other than

enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and,

or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder, except,
in each case, for such breaches or defaults as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received,
as of the date of this Agreement, any notice in writing to terminate or not
renew, in whole or in part, any Material Contract.

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, the Company has not received, as of the date of this
Agreement, any notice in writing from any Major Customer or Major Supplier
that it intends to terminate, or not renew, its relationship with the Company
or its Subsidiaries.

investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
who is entitled to any fee or commission from the Company or any of its

or other anti-takeover statute or similar Delaware statute (a "Takeover
Statute") or regulation applies to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Merger).

  

  

Section 5.27 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Article 5 (as

SEC Documents), neither the Company nor any other Person makes any
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or

the Schedule 14D-9 shall not, on the date the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the
SEC or on the date the Schedule 14D-9 is first published, sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

  

(b) The Offer Documents shall not, on the date the Offer Documents are filed
with the SEC or on the date the Offer Documents are first published, sent or
given to the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 6.05(b) shall not apply to statements or omissions included or
incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents based upon information
supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives specifically for use or
incorporation by reference therein.

  

  

Section 6.06 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i)
fully executed commitment letter(s) and redacted fee letter (the "Debt
Commitment Letters") from Suntrust Bank and Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide Parent and/or Merger
Subsidiary with debt financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Debt Financing") and (ii) a fully executed
commitment letter (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letters, the "Financing Commitment Letters") from Avista Capital
Partners III, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners (Offshore) III, L.P. confirming
their respective commitments, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide Parent with equity financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Equity Financing," and together with
the Debt Financing, the "Financing").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a valid
and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto and is
enforceable against Parent and the other parties thereto in accordance with
its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equity). As of the date hereof, each of
the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto and is enforceable against Parent and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity). Parent or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, none
of the Financing Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any
respect, no such amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise
modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any
Financing Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, and, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in ARTICLE 5, Parent
has no reason to believe, as of the date hereof, that it will not be able to
satisfy any material term or condition of closing of the Financing (other than
any such term or condition the satisfaction of which is within the control of
the Company) that is required to be satisfied as a condition of the Financing,
or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent at the Offer
Closing. There are no side letters or other Contracts to which Parent or any
of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing (other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters) that would delay or impair the
Financing being funded or the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the full
amount of the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitment
Letters, the aggregate proceeds of the Financing (together with the cash
available to the Company) are in an amount sufficient to consummate the Offer
and the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all
related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 6.07 Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has caused each Guarantor to deliver to the Company the duly executed
Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity). No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of any
Guarantor under the Guaranty.

  

  

Section 6.08 Certain Arrangements. There are no Contracts or commitments to
enter into Contracts (a) between Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors or
any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or (b)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve
this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.09 Parent and Merger Subsidiary Acknowledgements.

the Company in Article 5 of this Agreement (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Company SEC Documents), Parent and Merger

presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the Transactions, or in respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever; and

  

  

(ii) no officer, agent, representative or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has any authority, express or implied, to make any
representations, warranties or agreements not specifically set forth in this
Agreement and subject to the limited remedies herein provided.

  

  

(b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary specifically disclaim: (i) that they are
relying upon or have relied upon any such other representations or warranties
that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledge and agree that the
Company has specifically disclaimed and does hereby specifically disclaim any
such other representation or warranty made by any Person, and (ii) any
obligation or duty by the Company to make any disclosures of fact not required
to be disclosed pursuant to the specific representations and warranties set
forth in Article 5 of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.10 No Overlapping Business. As of the date hereof, none of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates own an interest (other
than non-controlling interests held by Affiliates of Parent) in any Person (x)
that is engaged in the business of security alarm monitoring, truck trailer
tracking and tank monitoring or (y) that otherwise derives a material portion
of its revenues from any line of business that competes with Company Products.

customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures, to the extent relating
to any pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in

Company's reasonable judgment, would reasonably be likely to be harmful to the
operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries in any material respect); and
(ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Persons or groups of Persons with respect

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.03, from and after the
Solicitation Period End Date (and, with respect to subclauses (iii) through
(vi) (and subclause (vii) to the extent it relates to subclauses (iii) through
(vi)) of this clause (b), from and after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this

subject to Regulation 14D of the Exchange Act in any
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (iv), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (v)
approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or any other applicable
Takeover Statute, (vi) if a Rights Plan adopted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in effect, without Parent's prior written consent (in its sole
discretion), exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their
Affiliates) or any transaction (other than the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) from the
applicability of any restrictions set forth in such Rights Plan or otherwise

propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.
Except and so long as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 7.03(c) and
subject to the following sentence, on the Solicitation Period End Date (and
thereafter), (x) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party and its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and (y) the Company shall promptly request that each such Third Party and its
Representatives promptly return or destroy all confidential information
theretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information).
Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations under this Section
7.03(b), from and after the Solicitation Period End Date until 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the tenth (10th) calendar day following the Solicitation
Period End Date (the "Cut-Off Date"), the Company (I) may continue to engage
in the activities described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of
this Section 7.03(b) and (II) is not required to comply with the immediately
previous sentence, in each case, with any Excluded Party (but only for so long
as such Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party); provided, however, that if
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines either to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with Section 7.03(e) in respect of an Acquisition Proposal made by
an Excluded Party and the Company delivers the notice contemplated by Section
7.03(e)(iv) in respect of such Acquisition Proposal on or before the Cut-Off
Date, then the Cut-Off Date shall be extended (but solely with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal (and any amendment, modification or supplement thereto)

(4) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, contemplated
by Section 7.03(e)(iv) and Section 7.03(e)(v) (but only so long as the Company
is in compliance with Section 7.03(e)). Promptly after the Solicitation Period
End Date (and in any event no later than forty-eight (48) hours following the
Solicitation Period End Date), the Company shall provide to Parent the
information described in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 7.03(d) with
respect to each Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the identities of all identified
members of the group that constitutes such Excluded Party).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.03 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Offer Closing, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal that
is not withdrawn and that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of Section 7.03(b) and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and the Company's outside legal counsel) constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (a "Qualified
Acquisition Proposal"), the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and its Representatives and/or (ii) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, subject and pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(a copy of which shall promptly be provided to Parent) executed by such third
Party prior to receiving such non-public information; provided that (A) the
Company shall make available to Parent any material information relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is furnished or made available to such
Third Party which was not previously made available to Parent at substantially
the same time it is made available to such Third Party and shall give Parent
and Merger Subsidiary notice confirming that such disclosure is being made
pursuant to this Section 7.03(c) and (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall withhold such portions of documents or
information, or provide pursuant to customary "clean-room" or other
appropriate procedures, to the extent relating to any pricing or other matters
that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if the exchange of such
information (or portions thereof) would, in the Company's reasonable judgment,
reasonably be likely to be harmful to the operation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in any material respect); provided, further, that prior to taking
any action described in Section 7.03(c)(i) or Section 7.03(c)(ii) above, (x)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take any such actions would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the holders of Company
Stock under Applicable Law and (y) the Company shall deliver to Parent a
written notice advising Parent that it will take such action.

  

  

(d) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date until the Effective Time
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any event, within
forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment, modification
or supplement thereto), which notice shall include (i) the identity of such
Third Party, (ii) copies of such Acquisition Proposal (or any material
amendment, modification or supplement thereto), if written (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any documents relating to the financing of such
Acquisition Proposal (portions of which may be redacted to the extent
customary and required to comply with confidentiality provisions)), and (iii)
reasonably detailed summaries of any oral Acquisition Proposal (or any
material amendment, modification or supplement thereto). The Company shall
notify Parent promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of any
changes to such material terms and conditions and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed within forty-eight (48) hours of any material developments regarding
the status and terms thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) From and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, except as permitted by Section 7.03(f), the Company (and the
Company Board or any committee thereof) shall not (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(i), unless:

  

  

(i) the Company or any of its Representatives receives a Qualified Acquisition
Proposal that has not been withdrawn;

  

  

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the Company's
outside legal counsel, that such Qualified Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

  

  

(iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Stock under
Applicable Law;

  

  

(iv) the Company provides a written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
that the Company will take such action on the fourth (4th) Business Days
following the receipt of such notice setting forth the information described
in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 7.03(d) with respect to such Superior
Proposal, and (B) during the four (4) Business Day period following Parent's
and Merger Subsidiary's receipt of such notice the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives (to the extent
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their Representatives desire to negotiate) to
make adjustments and/or modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Guaranty; provided,
however, that any material amendment to the financial terms or any other
material amendment to any such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notice to be delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 7.03(e)(iv) (provided, that references to the four (4) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period); and

  

  

(v) following such four (4) Business Day period (and any additional two (2)
Business Day period), the Company Board again determines in good faith, (A)
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and the Company's outside legal counsel, that such Qualified
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (after taking
into account and/or giving effect to any adjustments or modifications offered
or proposed by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their Representatives) and (B)
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the
holders of Company Stock under Applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The Company Board may also make an Adverse Recommendation Change at any
time prior to the Offer Closing if, but only if, an Intervening Event shall
have occurred and be continuing and prior to making such Adverse
Recommendation Change:

  

  

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, as a result of such Intervening Event, the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties to holders of Company Stock under Applicable
Law;

  

  

(ii) the Company provides a written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
that the Company will effect an Adverse Recommendation Change after four (4)
Business Days following the receipt of such notice and describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

  

  

(iii) during such four (4) Business Day period following Parent's and Merger
Subsidiary's receipt of such notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their Representatives (to the extent Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or their Representatives desire to negotiate) to make adjustments
and/or modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitment Letters and the Guaranty; provided, however, that any
change in the Intervening Event that would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company Board's determination of such event or circumstance
being an Intervening Event shall require a new written notice to be delivered
by the Company to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 7.03(f)
(provided, that references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be
deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period); and

  

  

(iv) following such four (4) Business Day period (and any additional two (2)
Business Day period), the Company Board again determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, as a result of such
Intervening Event, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to holders of
Company Stock under Applicable Law (after taking into account and/or giving
effect to any adjustments or modifications offered or proposed by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or their Representatives).

  

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under Applicable Law, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (iii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law
or (iv) making accurate disclosure to its stockholders of any factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company; provided, however, that, in each case, the Company
shall not effect, or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position
which constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change unless specifically
permitted by this Section 7.03 (other than this Section 7.03(g)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) The approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing any
Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be irrevocable and unconditional and no Adverse Recommendation
Change or other action shall change such approval for purposes of causing any
Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without Parent's prior written consent (in its sole discretion),
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into, adopt or
implement, or agree to enter into, adopt or implement, any Rights Plan.
Promptly (and in any event, within one (1) Business Day) following the entry
into, adoption or implementation by the Company of a Rights Plan (for the
avoidance of doubt, following receipt of Parent's prior written consent), the
Company shall exempt Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the
Merger) from such Rights Plan, or otherwise render such Rights Plan
inapplicable to Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Merger), and
such exemption or rendering shall be irrevocable and unconditional and no
Adverse Recommendation Change or other action shall change such exemption or
rendering.

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (A) need not contain any "standstill"
or similar covenant and (B) may include provisions that are less favorable in
the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, so long as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality
Agreement concurrently with execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to include substantially similar provisions for the benefit of the
parties thereto; provided, further, that an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement shall not prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives from complying with any of the provisions of this Agreement
(or adversely affect the rights of the Company thereunder upon compliance by
the Company with the provisions of this Agreement).

  

  

(ii) "Excluded Party" means any Third Party, group of Third Parties or group
that includes any Third Party (so long as such Third Party and the other

equity financing of such group at all times following the Solicitation Period
End Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement) from whom the Company
has received, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to
the Solicitation Period End Date, a written Acquisition Proposal that is not
withdrawn and that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of
Section 7.03(a) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
the Company's outside legal counsel) prior to the Solicitation Period End Date
is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that any such Third Party or group shall cease to be an Excluded
Party for so long as such Acquisition Proposal (and any amendment,
modification or supplement thereto) ceases to constitute, or reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) "Intervening Event" means a material event or circumstance (other than
in connection with or relating to an Acquisition Proposal) affecting the

known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any
consequence thereof, becomes known to the Company or the Company Board after
the date hereof and prior to the Offer Closing.

  

  

(iv) "Superior Proposal" means a written Acquisition Proposal (with (x) the

Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the Company's outside legal
counsel, (A) to be reasonably likely to be consummated (without material
modification of its terms), if accepted, and (B) is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Company's stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account and/or giving effect
to any adjustments or modifications offered or proposed by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or their Representatives), in each case, after taking into account
the legal, financial (including any break-up fees and expense reimbursement
and the form of consideration), regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal (including the availability of financing and potential
stockholder litigation), the conditionality of and contingencies related to
such Acquisition Proposal, the expected timing and risk of completion, the
identity of such Third Party and such other factors as the Company Board
considers to be appropriate.

  

  

(j) The Company agrees that in the event any of the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' Representatives take any action which, if taken by the Company
or the Company Board, would constitute a beach of this Section 7.03, then the
Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section 7.03 for all purposes
of this Agreement. The Company shall inform its Representatives of its
obligations under this Section 7.03 and shall instruct its Representatives to
comply with this Section 7.03.

the Company shall not be obligated to disclose any information to the extent
the Company, in its reasonable judgment, determines that doing so would (i)
violate any Applicable Law, rules or regulations, (ii) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege or other privilege with respect to such information
or (iii) result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or result in the disclosure of trade secrets of third
parties. The Confidentiality Agreements shall automatically terminate upon the
Effective Time.

or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or their marks or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 7.06 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and
the Company Board shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to take such actions as

ARTICLE 8

  

COVENANTS OF PARENT

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 8.01 Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.02 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) For the later of (i) six years after the Offer Closing and (ii) the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitation, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any Losses incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim or Proceeding, and provide advancement of
expenses to all present and former officers, directors, employees and agents
(including fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person"), to the same extent
such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to the Company's
certificate of incorporation, the Company's bylaws and the indemnification
agreements of the Company in existence on the date hereof with any directors
and officers of the Company. As used in this Section 8.02, "Losses" means any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable and documented costs,
reasonable and documented expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement of any claim or Proceeding.

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in
existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
any agreement between any Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, regarding elimination of
liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for a non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with
respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby); provided that the cost per annum payable
for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its current fiscal year (such maximum amount, the "Maximum
Tail Premium") and if the cost for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds the
Maximum Tail Premium, then the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium;
provided, that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable expectation to
participate in the selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with
respect thereto. If the Company shall for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policy as of the Offer Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company in place
as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as that provided under the Company's existing policies as of the
date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to purchase comparable policies for such six (6)-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided
under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that the
cost per annum payable for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed the
Maximum Tail Premium and if the cost for such "tail" insurance policies
exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.

  

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys of its
property and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.02 (including this
Section 8.02(d)).

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 8.02 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 8.02 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8.03 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Until December 31, 2013 (the "Transition Period"), with respect to United
States employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time who remain employed during the requisite period ("Company
Employees"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide compensation and employee benefits that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided under the Employee
Plans as of the date hereof (other than any equity or equity-based and
nonqualified retirement or deferred compensation plans or arrangements).

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.03(a), during the twelve
(12)-month period following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor and continue, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's employment,
severance, change in control, retention and termination plans and agreements
that are set forth on Section 8.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in
each case, as in effect on the date hereof, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or
modification required to comply with Applicable Law or entered into with the
consent of the applicable Company Employee.

  

  

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement,
including 401(k), vacation, paid-time off and severance plans, but other than
any equity or equity-based plan, maintained by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees are entitled to participate
and that replaces an equivalent Employee Plan, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and vesting, each Company
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates, to the extent recognized prior to the Effective
Time for the same purpose under the equivalent Employee Plan; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation.

  

  

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any health
benefit plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate that replace an equivalent Employee Plan that is a health benefit
plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, except to the extent
that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under any health benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate that replace an Employee Plan that is a health benefit plan in the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 12.06, nothing in this Section
8.03 or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall create any right or
remedy (including any third-party beneficiary right) in any Person, including
any employees, former employees, any participant in any Employee Plan or any
beneficiary thereof, nor create any right to employment or continued
employment or any term or condition of employment with Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, nor prevent or otherwise
restrict the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any
Company Employee, (ii) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, contract or
arrangement, or (iii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation
plan, program, policy, agreement, contract or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

  

  

Section 8.04 Financing.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions therein, but not in excess
or outside of such provisions unless so agreed by Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
and taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period), and
shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision under, the Financing Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces (or would have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the cash proceeds available from the Financing (including
by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless
(A) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount and (B) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in
clause (A) above, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 6.06
shall be true) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing, or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing
Commitment Letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
materially delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the date of the Offer
Closing or (B) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Commitment Letters (provided that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 8.04, Parent and Merger Subsidiary may amend the
Debt Commitment Letters to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents and other similar entities or modify the pricing terms). Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions
but not in excess or outside such flex provisions unless so agreed by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary) contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms no
less favorable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary (in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) than the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters), (iii)
to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to funding in the Debt Commitment Letters and in the Equity
Commitment Letter that are within their control, (iv) in the event that all
conditions in the Financing Commitment Letters and this Agreement have been
satisfied, to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Offer Closing and
(v) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and provide the Company copies of material definitive agreements for the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt notice (and, in any event, within
forty-eight (48) hours) (A) of any breach or default by any party to any of
the Financing Commitment Letters of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary becomes
aware, (B) of the receipt of any written notice from any Financing Source with
respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitment Letters of any
provisions of the Financing Commitment Letters or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitment
Letters with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of
the Financing to be funded at Closing and (C) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the
Offer on substantially the same terms and conditions, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters. Upon the
occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is necessary to fund an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing ("Alternative Financing")
from the same or alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less
favorable (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, taken as a whole (taking into account any flex provisions, but not
in excess or outside such flex provisions unless so agreed by Parent and
Merger Subsidiary), than those set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, in
an amount when added to the portion of the Financing being replaced that is
still available, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Subsidiary be deemed or construed
to require Parent or Merger Subsidiary to, and neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary shall be required to, (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source
other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitment, (ii) pay any fees in excess
of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments or (iii) agree to any term
that is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable economic provision
of the Debt Financing Commitments or any related fee letter (including any
flex provision therein). Parent shall deliver to the Company complete and
correct copies of all Contracts (including redacted fee letters) pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion
of the Debt Financing. Any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing"
and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include the financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments on the date hereof, as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced (in whole or in part) by this Section 8.04(b), including
any Alternative Financing, and references to "Debt Commitment Letters" shall
include such debt commitment letters and any redacted fee letter as permitted
to be amended, modified or replaced (in whole or in part) by this Section
8.04(b), including any commitment letter(s) and redacted fee letters entered
into in connection with an Alternative Financing.

Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

Section 9.04 Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event, fact or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to cause the Offer Conditions set forth on clause (b) of Exhibit A
not to be satisfied (provided, that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant
to this sentence shall not be considered in determining whether the Offer
Conditions set forth on clause (b) of Exhibit A have been satisfied). In
addition, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

  

  

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary on its part under Applicable
Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from Nasdaq and the deregistration
of the Company Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time.

Section 9.06 FCC Approvals. Each of the Company and Parent will prepare and
file (after providing the other party with reasonable time to review)
application(s) or notification(s) under any Communications Law that requires
the prior approval or consent of, or notification(s) to, a Governmental
Authority for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all required filings with, or applications to, the FCC
for its grant of approval for the transfer of control to Parent of any
authorization(s) issued by the FCC to the Company or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, such grant of approval referred to herein as the "FCC Grant"),
as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of
the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the
FCC or any other Governmental Authority in connection therewith and to take
all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the FCC to issue the
FCC Grant and other Governmental Authorities to issue their approval or
consent, as required. In the event that any petition for reconsideration or
appeal of the FCC Grant or any other required Governmental Authority consent
or approval is filed, the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such petition or
appeal. In the event that the FCC issues a decision rescinding the FCC Grant
or any Governmental Authority rescinds its consent or approval, the Parties
will cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
seek reconsideration and to appeal such decision. In the event that,
notwithstanding the cooperation and commercially reasonable efforts of the
Company and the Parent, the FCC rescinds the FCC Grant, or any Governmental
Authority rescinds its consent or approval, by a final order as to which no
further reconsideration or appeal is available, the Company and the Parent
agree to cooperate to comply with such final order with the plan of action for
that compliance to be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Parent.

  

  

Section 9.07 Transaction Litigation. In the event that any litigation
(including stockholder litigation) related to this Agreement, the Merger, the
Offer, the Top-Up or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
brought, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, prior to
the Effective Time against the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or the members
of the Company Board, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof. The Company and Parent shall give each other the opportunity
to participate, at their own expense, in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any pending or threatened litigation related to the
transactions contemplated hereby. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such
stockholder litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have
consented in writing; provided, however, that (a) Parent's consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned to the extent such
compromise, settlement or arrangement is a "disclosure only settlement" that
does not obligate the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary (i) to separately
mail such disclosure to the Company's stockholders (nor would such mailing be
required under Applicable Law) or (ii) to incur any monetary obligations
(other than attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs' counsel in such litigation) and
(b) Parent's consent shall be in its sole discretion in all other cases.

forth in Exhibit A not to be satisfied, and such breach has not been or is
incapable of being cured by the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) thirty
(30) days after the Company's receipt of written notice thereof from the
Parent; provided, however, that the right to terminate pursuant to this clause
(c)(ii) shall not be available to Parent to the extent Parent or Merger
Subsidiary has materially breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth herein; or

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) prior to the Offer Closing, upon written notice to Parent, if the Company

Agreement including pursuant to Section 2.03(c), this Agreement may be amended
or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after the Offer

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to clauses (A) or (C)
of Section 11.01(c)(i) or by the Company pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i), then
the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (or one or more
Persons designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, in the case of a
termination by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such termination
and, in the case of a termination by the Company, immediately before and as a
condition to such termination; provided, however, that in the event that this
Agreement is terminated on or before the Cut-Off Date pursuant to (x) clause
(A) of Section 11.01(c)(i) as a result of an Adverse Recommendation Change
effected pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.03(c) in response to a
Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party or (y) Section 11.01(d)(i) and the
applicable Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal that is entered into substantially concurrently with the termination
of this Agreement is with an Excluded Party, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more Persons designated by Parent) 50%
of the Company Termination Fee (instead of the full Company Termination Fee)
in immediately available funds, in the case of a termination by Parent, within
two (2) Business Days after such termination and, in the case of a termination
by the Company, immediately before and as a condition to such termination

  

  

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to clause (B) of

Parent (or one or more Persons designated by Parent) 50% of the Company

after such termination; provided, however, that if within 12 months following
the date of such termination, any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when
made) shall have been consummated or entered into and at any time thereafter
consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more Persons
designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, concurrently with such
consummation, an amount (not less than zero) equal to the Company Termination
Fee minus any portion of the Company Termination Fee previously paid pursuant
to this Section 12.04(b)(ii); provided, further, that if the material breach
of Section 7.03 specified in clause (B) of Section 11.01(c)(i) was a
consequence of an act taken by the Company or its Representatives, or the
failure by the Company or its Representatives to take an act required to be
taken under this Agreement, with the actual knowledge that the taking of, or
the failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause
a material breach of Section 7.03, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to Parent (or one or more Persons designated by Parent) the full amount
of the Company Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days following such
termination, in lieu of any other fee pursuant to this Section 12.04(b)(ii);

  

  

(iii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
11.01(b)(i), by Parent pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(ii) or by Parent pursuant
to Section 11.01(c)(ii) (but, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
11.01(c)(ii), only if the failure to satisfy the condition specified therein
results from an intentional and material breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein) and (B)
within 12 months following the date of such termination, any Acquisition
Proposal (regardless of when made) shall have been consummated or entered into
and at any time thereafter consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent
(or one or more Persons designated by Parent) in immediately available funds,
concurrently with such consummation, the Company Termination Fee; provided
that for purposes of this Section 12.04(b)(iii), all references to "20%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) The "Company Termination Fee" shall equal $8,200,000.00. To the extent
paid to Parent (or to one or more Persons designated by Parent), the parties
agree that the Company Termination Fee is attributable to the termination of
the rights of Parent to acquire the Company Stock hereunder.

  

  

(v) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(c) Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(d)(ii) (but only if the breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of
any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein was a principal factor of the failure to consummate the
Offer) or Section 11.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Company in immediately available funds $14,050,000.00 (the "Parent
Termination Fee") within two (2) Business Days after such termination.

  

  

(ii) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

  

  

(d) Acknowledgements. Each party acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation
and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 12.04(b) or Section
12.04(c) are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (except as and to the extent provided in Section 12.11(d)), but
subject to the Company's rights set forth in Section 12.13, (i) the Company's
right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee when payable pursuant
to Section 12.04(c) and/or the reimbursement of costs and expenses and
indemnification to the extent required under Section 7.05(b), in either case,
from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company Related
Parties against Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors and any of their
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, Financing Sources, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether intentionally, willfully or
otherwise) or otherwise and (ii) upon payment of such amount, none of the
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 12.13, (A) Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the
Company Termination Fee when payable pursuant to Section 12.04(b) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current and future
direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners or assignees (collectively, "Company Related Parties") for
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether intentionally,
willfully or otherwise) or otherwise and (B) upon payment of such amount, none
of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) under no circumstances will the Parent
Related Parties be liable for monetary damages in excess of the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee whether to the Company or any other Company Related
Party, (2) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance
of the type permitted in accordance with Section 12.13 and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee under Section 12.04(c), under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee and (3) at
any time Parent shall have the right to satisfy in full any claim by the
Company for the Parent Termination Fee by consummating the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each of the Parent Related
Parties and the Company Related Parties shall have the right to enforce, and
shall be a beneficiary with respect to, the provisions of this Section
12.04(e), Section 12.13(a)(iv) and Section 12.13(b)(iv).

  

  

Section 12.05 Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement (regardless to whether the specific Section of this
Agreement references the Company Disclosure Schedule) and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
readily apparent on the face of the disclosure to a reasonable person who has
read that reference and such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 12.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

  

  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided in Article 3, Section
8.02 and Section 12.04(e), no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the Financing Sources shall be
express third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 12.03(a), Section
12.04(e), this Section 12.06, Section 12.07, Section 12.08 and Section 12.09.

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, by operation of law
or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or
Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of its
Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person;
provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this Section 12.06(b) shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 12.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state, except that to the extent required under
the Debt Commitment letter, New York law shall apply.

  

  

Section 12.08 Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. The parties hereto agree that a final trial court
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment. The parties hereto hereby
further agree that New York state or United States federal courts sitting in
the borough of Manhattan, City of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over any action brought against any Debt Financing Source under the Debt
Commitment Letters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

agreement or other communication). Signatures transmitted via email or
facsimile in the form of a PDF file shall be deemed originals.

Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its

or Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, or Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's use of, any such information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in certain "data rooms" or

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78

Section 12.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions

(i) Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 11, the Company shall be entitled to seek
and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief (A)
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including Parent's and Merger

Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, to be funded, in each case, in
the courts described in Section 12.08, in addition to any other remedy to
which it is entitled at Applicable Law or in equity; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, no such right may be enforced to cause
the Offer or the Merger to be consummated, the Offer Price or Merger
Consideration to be paid or the Equity Financing to be funded, whether under
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter, unless: (I) all of the Offer
Conditions shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived as
of the then-scheduled Expiration Time; (II) the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter, have irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing
that the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters will be funded
at the Offer Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Offer Closing;
and (III) the Company has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing
that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur; provided, further, that
notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, no such right may be enforced to cause
the Debt Financing to be funded, whether under this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letters, unless: (x) all of the Offer Conditions (other than the
Funding Condition) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived as of the then-scheduled Expiration Time; and (y) the Company has
irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing will occur.

  

  

(ii) Parent Termination Fee. The Company shall be entitled to payment of the
Parent Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 12.04(c)
hereof.

any Parent Related Party under this Agreement, other than as expressly set
forth in Section 7.05(b) and the right of the Company to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee as set forth in Section 12.04(c).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this Section 12.13, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that the right
of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this
Section 12.13, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 12.08 without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit
rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the
terms of this Section 12.13. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (to the extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly
applicable under the terms of this Section 12.13) shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Subsidiary and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
Applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in
part, at any time prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer in their
sole discretion (other than the Minimum Condition). The failure by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

ARTICLE EIGHT

  


 

  

Section 1. Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she (or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative), is or was at any time
after the date hereof a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was at
any time after the date hereof serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of
a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding
is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Corporation to the fullest extent which it is empowered to do so by the
DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection with such proceeding) and such indemnification shall inure to the
benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however,
that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article Eight, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by
the Board of Directors. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of
Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation
with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors
and officers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

B-2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2. Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any
indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section 1 of
this Article Eight or advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article
Eight shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the
written request of the director or officer. If a determination by the
Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article Eight is required, and the Corporation fails to
respond within 60 days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation
shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a
written request for indemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in
part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within 30
days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article
Eight shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in
whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding
in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any,
has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a
defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met
the applicable standard of conduct.

  

  

Section 3. Nonexclusivity of Article Eight. The rights to indemnification and
the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its
final disposition conferred in this Article Eight shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  

  

Section 4. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such
capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such liability under this Article Eight.

  

  

Section 5. Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of
this Article Eight in defending a proceeding or enforcing the person's rights
to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article Eight shall
be paid by the Corporation in advance of such proceeding's final disposition
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

B-3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6. Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing
provisions of this Article Eight and who are or were employees or agents of
the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation
as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any
time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.

  

  

Section 7. Contract Rights. The provisions of this Article Eight shall be
deemed to be a contract right between the Corporation and each director or
officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article Eight
and the relevant provisions of the DGCL or other applicable law are in effect,
and any repeal or modification of this Article Eight or any such law shall not
affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of
facts or proceeding then existing.

  

  

Section 8. Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this Article Eight,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article
Eight with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she
would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.

  

  

ARTICLE NINE

  

  

In the event that a director or officer of the Corporation who is also an
employee, partner, principal, director or officer of Avista (as defined below)
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a
corporate opportunity for the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, such
director or officer of the Corporation shall have fully satisfied and
fulfilled the fiduciary duty of such director or officer of the Corporation
and its shareholders with respect to such corporate opportunity, if such
director or officer acts in a manner consistent with the following policy: (i)
a corporate opportunity that any person who is a director or officer of the
Corporation, and who is also an employee, partner, principal, director or
officer of Avista, acquires knowledge of while acting in such person's
capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation, shall belong to the
Corporation and (ii) otherwise, any corporate opportunity may be pursued by
Avista and any pursuit by Avista shall not constitute a breach of fiduciary
liability. For the purposes of this Article Nine, "Avista" means Avista
Capital Partners III, L.P., Avista Capital Partners (Offshore) III, L.P.,
Avista Capital Holdings, L.P. and each of their respective direct or indirect
controlling affiliates and each of their respective, and its controlling
affiliates' respective, nominees, advisory and investment managing entities.

  

  

The Corporation hereby eliminates, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
personal liability of any person who serves as a director of the Corporation

Corporation to such greater extent. This Article Nine shall not eliminate or
limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to
the date when this Article Nine becomes effective.
