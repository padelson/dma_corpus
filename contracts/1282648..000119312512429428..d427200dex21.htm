In addition, HALCÓN RESOURCES CORPORATION, the parent company of Buyer ("

of those provisions hereof relating to the issuance of Preferred Stock (as
hereinafter defined).

_RECITALS_

In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the benefits to be
derived by each party hereunder and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Petro-Hunt
Parties, Buyer and HRC (with regard to the Preferred Stock) agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I._

_Properties; Reorganization_

1.01 _Definition of Properties_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Properties_ " means the following, except to the extent constituting
Excluded Assets:

 

(a) The respective undivided Working Interests or WIs (as these terms are
hereinafter defined) and Net Revenue Interests or NRIs (as these terms are
hereinafter defined) in and to, together with any and all of the Petro-Hunt
Parties other rights, titles and interests in and to, the oil, gas and/or
mineral leases, leasehold interests, royalty, and other interests in or
relating to interests described in _Exhibit "A", Part I_ hereto (collectively,
the " _Leases_ "), together with corresponding undivided interests in (i) all
rights, privileges, benefits, and powers

 



1  conferred upon the holder of the Leases with respect to the use and
occupation of the surface or subsurface of the lands covered by the Leases
(the " _Lands_ ") that may be necessary, convenient, or incidental to the
possession and enjoyment of the Leases, (ii) all rights in respect of any
pooled or unitized acreage located in whole or in part within the Lands by
virtue of the Leases, including rights to production from the pool or unit
allocated to any Lease being a part thereof, regardless of whether such

derived from any unitization, pooling, operating, communitization or other
agreement or from any declaration or order of any governmental authority) (the
" _Pooled Units_ "), (iii) all rights, options, titles, and interests of the
Petro-Hunt Parties granting the Petro-Hunt Parties the right to obtain, or
otherwise earn interests within the Lands no matter how earned, (iv) all
easements, rights-of-way, subsurface easements, licenses, permits, servitudes,
surface leases, and similar interests insofar and only insofar as the
same relate to or are applicable to or used in developing or operating the

Properties described in subparagraphs (b)-(f) below, and (v) all tenements,
hereditaments, and appurtenances belonging to any of the foregoing, save and
except any fee minerals or overriding royalty interests owned by the Petro-
Hunt Parties within the Properties, insofar and only insofar as the exclusion
of the mineral fee interests and overriding royalty interests do not reduce
the NRIs allocable to the Properties being sold to Buyer hereunder below
those described in _Exhibit "A"_ and _Exhibit "C"_ attached hereto;

 

(b) All of the right, title and interest of the Petro-Hunt Parties under the
contracts, agreements, and other instruments described on _Exhibit "B"_

Parties in whole or in part, which are not described on _Exhibit "B"_ hereto,
and that are appurtenant to the Properties or used or held for use in
connection with the ownership or operation of the Properties or with
the production, treatment, sale, supply or disposal of water, hydrocarbons
and associated substances therefrom or thereon (in the aggregate, the "
_Contracts_ "), including, without limitation, all contractual rights to
interests that may be earned by or assigned to the Petro-Hunt Parties under
term assignments, farmout agreements, farmin agreements, participation
agreements and other similar types of agreements, including, without
limitation, those rights and interests that may be earned that are described
in _Exhibit "A", Part II_ attached hereto;

(c) All of the right, title and interest of the Petro-Hunt Parties in and to
the real, personal and mixed property used in the operation of the Properties
owned by the Petro-Hunt Parties in whole or in part or credited to the joint 

 



2  account of the Petro-Hunt Parties (the " _Equipment_ ") including, but not
limited to (i) all oil, gas and condensate wells (whether producing, not

disposal wells and systems located on the Leases or lands unitized or pooled
with the Leases, together with all wellhead equipment, fixtures (including,
but not limited to, field separators and liquid extractors), pipe, casing,
and tubing in, on or appurtenant to the wells (" _Wells_ "), including,

(d) All crude oil, natural gas, condensate, distillate, natural gasoline,

(e) All oil which was produced from the Leases and which was, as of the

(f) It is the intent of the parties that the Properties also include all
right, title and interest of the Petro-Hunt Parties in any other real,
personal or mixed property interests of the Petro-Hunt Parties located within
the boundaries of the plats or maps set forth as _Exhibit "A", Part III_
attached hereto, and which are used in connection with the ownership or
operation of the Properties, and therefore without limiting the generality of
the above, this provision does not limit any of the other
Properties described herein; and

(g) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.06_ hereof, all of the
files, records, documents, correspondence and data now in the possession or

For purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings
attributed to them: (i) " _Net Revenue Interest_ " (or " _NRI_ ") means the

defined), or other Properties, after deducting all of lessors royalties,
overriding royalties, net profits interests, production payments and other
burdens on oil, gas and other minerals or substances produced therefrom,
expressed as a percentage or a decimal; and (ii) " _Working Interest_ " (or "
_WI_ ") means that share of the costs, expenses, burdens and obligations of
any type or nature, along with the right to explore for, develop, produce,
and sell Hydrocarbons, attributable to the Petro-Hunt Parties interest in the
applicable Lease, Pooled Unit or Well (as hereinafter defined), or other
Properties, expressed as a percentage or a decimal.

 



3 1.02 _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the assets and properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M

described in _Schedule 1.02_  (the " _Excluded Assets_ ").

1.03 _Effective Time_. The Properties shall comprise and include (and Petro-
Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar FB/M Successor shall be entitled to) all
production, benefits and claims relating to the Properties attributable to
periods from and after on June 1, 2012, (herein called the " _Effective Time_
") (including all Hydrocarbons produced and saved during periods from and
after the Effective Time) as part of the assets and properties to which they

cause each of the following to occur (collectively, the " _Reorganization_
"):

(a) PH will cause the following:

 

(1) PH will form a new Delaware limited liability company, Petro-Hunt Holdings

(2) The members of PH will contribute the membership interests in PH to Petro-
Hunt Holdings such that Petro-Hunt Holdings will be the sole member of PH.

(3) PH will be converted into a Texas limited liability company pursuant

surviving successor entity).

 



4 (4) PH will merge (the " _Petro-Hunt Merger_ "), pursuant to Section 10.003
_et. seq._ of the TBOC resulting in two entities: (A) Petro-Hunt Fort

Successor_ "), which will have as its assets and properties the Properties
owned by PH immediately prior to the effective time of the Petro-Hunt Merger
and will have as its liabilities and obligations the " _FB/M Obligations_ "
(defined in _Section 8.04(c)_ below) of PH immediately prior to the Petro-
Hunt Merger and (B) Petro-Hunt Successor Entity LLC, or a similar name ("

assets and properties of PH immediately prior to the effective time of the
Petro-Hunt Merger other than the Properties, and will have as its liabilities
and obligations all of the liabilities and obligations of PH immediately prior
to the effective time of the Petro-Hunt Merger (including, without
limitation, the Petro-Hunt Party Obligations (as defined in _Section 8.04(c)_
below)), other than the FB/M Obligations of PH. Petro-Hunt Successor will also
succeed to all of the rights of PH under this Agreement and will be subject
to the liabilities and obligations of the PH under this Agreement.

(5) As a result of the Petro-Hunt Merger, all of the membership interests of
PH will be canceled and converted into membership interests in Petro-Hunt FB/M
Successor; and Petro-Hunt Successor and Petro-Hunt Holdings will thereby own
all of the membership interests of Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Petro-Hunt
Successor.

(b) Pillar will cause the following:

 

(1) Pillar will form a new Delaware limited liability company, Pillar Holdings
LLC (" _Pillar Holdings_ ") with all of the membership interests in Pillar
Holdings to be owned by the same persons, and in the same proportions, as the
membership interests are held in Pillar.

 

(2) The members of Pillar will contribute the membership interests in Pillar
to Pillar Holdings such that Pillar Holdings will be the sole member of
Pillar.

(3) Pillar will merge (the " _Pillar Merger_ "), pursuant to Section 10.003
_et. seq._ of the TBOC resulting in two entities: (A) Pillar Fort
Berthold/Marmon Successor Entity LLC, or a similar name (" _Pillar FB/M
Successor_ "), which will have as its assets and properties the Properties
owned by Pillar immediately prior to the effective time of the Pillar Merger
and will have as its liabilities and obligations the FB/M Obligations (defined
in _Section 8.04(c)_ below) of Pillar immediately prior 

 



5  to the Pillar Merger and (B) Pillar Energy Successor Entity LLC, or a

(including, without limitation, the Petro-Hunt Party Obligations), other than
the FB/M Obligations of Pillar. Pillar Successor will also succeed to all of
the rights of Pillar under this Agreement and will be subject to
the liabilities and obligations of Pillar under this Agreement.

(4) As a result of the Pillar Merger, all of the membership interests of
Pillar will be canceled and converted into membership interests in Pillar FB/M
Successor; and Pillar Successor and Pillar Holdings will thereby own all of
the membership interests of Pillar FB/M Successor and Pillar Successor.

(c) The Petro-Hunt Parties shall provide Buyer with copies of all documents
and instruments related to or used to consummate the Reorganization. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the Petro-Hunt Merger and the Pillar Merger are
referred to as the " _Mergers_."

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Petro-Hunt
Parties will not be in breach of any provision of this Agreement, nor will
any representation or warranty of the Petro-Hunt Parties be inaccurate in any
respect solely by virtue of any secondary liability imposed on Petro-Hunt FB/M
Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor under TBOC Section 10.008; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, the
Petro-Hunt Party Obligations shall be deemed to include any obligation or
liability that is not expressly included as part of the FB/M Obligations,
including, without limitation, any such successor or secondary liability or
liabilities and obligations relating to assets, properties and businesses not
included as part of the Properties.

requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of the
states of the United States; (ii) certificates evidencing the Securities will
bear a legend in substantially the following form disclosing the transfer
restrictions described above:

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE _"A CT"_), OR APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
FOR SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, SATISFACTORY TO
THE ISSUER HEREOF, TO THE EFFECT THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER
THE ACT.

As a result of these transfer restrictions, Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar
Holdings may not be able to readily resell the Securities and may be required
to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Securities for an
indefinite period of time.

(v) _Independent Investigation._ Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings have
received sufficient information to make an investment decision with respect to
the Securities. Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings and their
professional advisor(s) have had the full opportunity to ask such questions,
receive such answers and obtain such information relevant to making an
investment decision with respect to the Securities. To the knowledge of
the Petro-Hunt Parties, the Securities have been offered to Petro-Hunt
Holdings and Pillar Holdings solely by means of direct contact between Petro-
Hunt Holdings, Pillar Holdings, Buyer and HRC.

 

(w) _Risk Factors; Knowledge and Experience._ Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar
Holdings are aware that there are substantial risks incident to accepting the
Securities as part of the Purchase Price, including that there is no current
market for the Preferred Stock and that the Preferred Stock cannot convert
into common shares absent an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
HRCs common stock to increase the number of its authorized shares of common
stock in an amount sufficient to permit conversion thereof and to approve the
issuance of the common stock upon conversion thereof, as well as the risks
summarized under

 



19  "Risk Factors" in HRCs SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined). Petro-Hunt
Holdings and Pillar Holdings have such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
an investment in the Securities, and Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings
have sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as the undersigned has
considered necessary to make an informed investment decision. Each of Petro-
Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings is able at this time and in the foreseeable
future to bear the economic risk of a total loss of their investment in the
Company represented by the Securities. In making the decision to accept the
Securities as part of the Purchase Price, Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar
Holdings have relied solely upon the representations and covenants of HRC
contained in this Agreement, HRCs SEC Documents (as hereinafter
defined), and their independent investigation.

_ARTICLE IV._

 

 _Covenants_

4.01 _Covenants of Petro-Hunt Parties_. The Petro-Hunt Parties covenant and
agree with Buyer that:

 

(a) _Buyer Access._ Prior to the Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties will (i)
provide access to the Properties and the Records to Buyer and its
representatives, for inspection and evaluation, and (ii) make available to
Buyer for examination in a virtual data room or at the office of the Petro-
Hunt Parties in Dallas, Texas, title and other records, books, files
(including, without limitation, land, lease, title, title opinion, production,
operations and regulatory files) and information relating to the Properties,
insofar as the same are in possession or reasonable control of the Petro-Hunt
Parties. The Petro-Hunt Parties will cooperate with Buyer in Buyers efforts
to obtain, at Buyers sole expense, any additional information relating to the
Properties that Buyer may consider useful in this transaction; provided,
however, that the Petro-Hunt Parties make no assurances or representations
herein to Buyer as to the completeness or accuracy of any of the records of
the Petro-Hunt Parties made available to Buyer hereunder. Rather, Buyer should
rely entirely on its own examination of the

 



24  records of the Petro-Hunt Parties and its own independent due diligence and
other investigations of the Properties, as well as on the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Petro Hunt-Parties in this Agreement and the
Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto. In the event the Petro-Hunt Parties
advise Buyer that it will withhold or be unable to deliver any information as
defined herein, the Petro-Hunt Parties will (a) identify to Buyer the general
nature or type of information that is being withheld; and (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents or approvals necessary to permit
disclosure to Buyer, only insofar as the Petro-Hunt Parties may do so without
violating legal constraints or any contractual prohibition, obligation, other
confidentiality requirement, or other commitment of the Petro-Hunt Parties to
a third party. Promptly after execution of this Agreement, the Petro-Hunt
Parties will provide to Buyer for inspection any and all historical file
information in the possession or control of the Petro-Hunt Parties regarding
crude oil, produced water, or Hazardous Materials spilled or disposed of on or
off-site of the Properties and the locations thereof; pits and pit closures;
substance, materials or equipment burials; land farming; land spreading;
underground injection; solid waste disposal sites; and environmental permits
and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans. The Petro-Hunt Parties
are not obligated to commission any updated abstracts, title opinions or
additional title information, but shall provide all of the same that is in the
possession (or reasonable control) of the Petro-Hunt Parties and shall
cooperate with Buyer in Buyers efforts to obtain, at Buyers reasonable
expense, such additional title information as Buyer may reasonably deem
prudent. To facilitate Buyers full evaluation of the Environmental Condition
of any of the subject Properties, as the law or third party rights may
dictate, and consistent with _Section 5.05_ hereof, the Petro-Hunt Parties
will permit representatives of Buyer to make such environmental tests on the
Properties as may be within immediate dominion, control and authority of the
Petro-Hunt Parties, including Phase I environmental assessments. Buyer may not
conduct Phase II environmental testing or other invasive surface or subsurface
testing on the Properties without the prior written consent of the Petro-Hunt
Parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Petro-Hunt
Parties will cooperate with Buyer in seeking third party operators consents
to inspect and test on non-operated Properties; provided, however, that there
is no assurance that such activities will be permitted by such third party
operators. To the extent consent is withheld or refused by Petro-Hunt Parties
as to the Properties, the affected Properties may be deemed to be burdened by
an Environmental Defect for purposes of this Agreement, and Buyer will have
the option to have the affected Properties excluded from this Agreement. If
such option is exercised by Buyer, the Purchase Price will be reduced by the
Allocated Values of any excluded Properties. The Petro-Hunt Parties shall
permit Buyer, at Buyers sole expense, to inspect and photocopy all
environmental information and records relevant to the Properties under this 
_Section 4.01(a)_ during reasonable business hours so long as this Agreement
is in effect; provided, however, that in the event the Petro-Hunt Parties
advise Buyer that it will withhold or be unable to deliver any environmental
information hereunder, because the Petro-Hunt Parties cannot do so without
violating any legal constraints or contractual prohibition,

 



25  obligation, other confidentiality requirement, or other commitment to a
third party; and, as to such withheld environmental information, the Petro-
Hunt Parties will (a) identify to Buyer the general nature or type of
information that is being withheld; and (b) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents or approvals necessary to permit disclosure to
Buyer. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, AS TO THE RECORDS,
INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS
OF THE RECORDS. Except with regard to statements, representations and
warranties of the Petro-Hunt Parties in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges
that any other conclusions drawn from the Records and other information
concerning the Properties are the result of its own independent review and
judgment.

(b) _Petro-Hunt Parties Cooperation._ The Petro-Hunt Parties acknowledge
that, following execution of this Agreement, Buyer may enter into debt
facilities or engage in offerings of securities requiring registration under
the Securities Act and the need for audited financials relating to
the Properties. Therefore, from and after the date of this Agreement
(including from time to time after the Closing Date), the Petro-Hunt Parties
and to the extent appropriate their affiliates, employees, representatives,
agents and accountants will promptly provide such cooperation and assistance
to Buyer or HRC as they may reasonably request (i) in connection with the
preparation of financial statements, reports and filings relating to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement that Buyer or HRC have determined
in good faith are required under applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the
New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ "), and (ii) to respond to any inquiries by
regulatory authorities, including the SEC and NYSE, relating to the foregoing
financial statements, reports and filings. Without limiting the foregoing,
such cooperation shall include providing HRC and its employees,
representatives, agents and external accountants, with access to, and the
right to copy, relevant books, records, files, and documentation in the
possession or under control of such the Petro-Hunt Parties or their
employees, representatives, agents and accountants (except for those
proprietary and confidential tax, engineering and accounting records otherwise
excluded from this Agreement). In so doing, the Petro-Hunt Parties will make
appropriate persons available to answer questions and execute and deliver or
cause to be executed and delivered any reasonable and customary external audit
firm representation letters as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or HRC.
Buyer will reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in
complying with this _Section 4.01(b)_ incurred by the Petro-Hunt Parties or
their affiliates.

(c) _Certain Pre-Closing Covenants Regarding Properties._ From the date of
this Agreement and continuing until Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties (i)

 



26  will cause the Properties to be operated and maintained in a good and
workmanlike manner consistent with prior practices, and will pay or cause to
be paid all costs and expenses in connection therewith, (ii) will not abandon
any Properties, nor will the Petro-Hunt Parties assign, convey, transfer,
mortgage or hypothecate any of the Properties (other than the sale of oil and
gas from or allocable to the Properties sold in accordance with the
applicable Contracts; and other than granting a lien, mortgage or security
interest as required under the credit facility of the Petro-Hunt Parties,
insofar as such liens, mortgages or security interests are fully released at
or prior to Closing), (iii) will maintain insurance now in force applicable
to the Properties, (iv) will comply in all material respects with and make

involves bodily harm, or imminent loss of life or property), and only insofar
as such expenses the Petro-Hunt Parties notify Buyer of in writing within five
(5) business days after incurring the same, from the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, without Buyers written consent (which Buyer will not
unreasonably withhold, and to which Buyer will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to within three (3) business days of written request by the
Petro-Hunt Parties for same), the Petro-Hunt Parties will not conduct or
authorize any operation on the Properties with costs in excess of $100,000 as
to their portion of any single project on the Properties, or which require AFE
approval by working interest owners under applicable operating agreements of
an expenditure of, over $100,000 as to their portion thereof.

(d) _No New Contracts._ From the date of this Agreement and continuing until
Closing, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which Buyer will not
unreasonably withhold, and to which Buyer will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to respond within three (3) business days of written
request by the Petro-Hunt Parties for same), and with due consideration of
_Schedule 3.01(k)_ hereto, Petro-Hunt Parties shall not enter into any new
material agreements or commitments with respect to the Properties, unless
such contract is both consistent with past practices and is a contract that
can be terminated upon not more than 90 days prior written notice without
penalty or payment for such termination; and the Petro-Hunt Parties will not
materially modify or terminate any of the Leases, Contracts or other

4.02 _Covenants of Buyer and HRC_. Buyer covenants and agrees with the Petro-
Hunt Parties that, prior to Closing:

 

(a) Buyer shall maintain its corporate status and to assure that as of the

(b) From the date hereof to the Closing, Buyer will conduct its business in a
manner consistent with past practice and in material compliance with

stockholders of HRC of the Proposals, HRC shall prepare and submit to the
NYSE (or other principal stock exchange upon which the Common Stock may then
be traded) an additional listing application covering the Conversion Shares in

to obtain the approval of the listing of the Conversion Shares upon such
exchange. In the event that the approvals necessary to permit the Preferred
Stock to be converted into Common Stock of HRC are not obtained at such

governance requirements regarding service as a director of HRC and to the
reasonable approval of the Board of Directors or any committee established by
the Board of Directors to address specified governance issues (the "
_Nominating and Governance Committee_ "). After such appointment, so long as
the Petro-Hunt Parties beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Rule
13d-3 under the

 



29  Exchange Act) at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(including for this purpose shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Preferred Stock), HRC will be required to recommend to its stockholders
the election of the Board Representative at HRCs annual meeting, subject to
satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a
director of HRC and to the reasonable approval of the Nominating and
Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), to the Board of Directors. If the Petro-
Hunt Parties no longer beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) the minimum percentage of Common Stock

rights under this _Section 4.02(g)_, and, at the written request of the Board
of Directors, shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause its Board
Representative to resign from the Board of Directors as promptly as possible
thereafter.

(ii) The Board Representative (including any successor nominee) duly selected
in accordance with _Section 4.02(g)(ii)_, shall, subject to applicable law,
be HRCs and HRCs Nominating and Governance Committees nominee to serve on
the Board of Directors. HRC shall use all reasonable best efforts to have the
Board Representative elected as a director of HRC and HRC shall solicit
proxies for each such person to the same extent as it does for any of its
other nominees to the Board of Directors.

(iii) The Petro-Hunt Parties shall have the power to designate the Board
Representatives replacement upon the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office of such director. The Board of
Directors will use its reasonable best efforts to take all action required to
fill the vacancy resulting therefrom with such person (including such person,
subject to applicable law, being HRCs and HRCs Nominating and Governance
Committees nominee to serve on the Board of Directors, using all reasonable
best efforts to have such person elected as director of HRC and HRC soliciting
proxies for such person to the same extent as it does for any of its other
nominees to the Board of Directors).

 

(iv) The Board Representative shall be entitled to the same rights, and shall
be bound by the same duties and obligations as other non-management members
of the Board of Directors of HRC generally.

(g) From the date hereof to the Closing, HRC shall not grant to any other
person the right, contractual or otherwise, to cause HRC to register under the
Securities Act any shares of HRCs common stock with registration rights that

the Registration Rights Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit "F"_.

 



30 4.03 _Covenants of Buyer and Petro-Hunt Parties as to Taxes_

 

(a) The Petro-Hunt Parties shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Petro-
Hunt Parties for Property Taxes (defined below) relating to the Properties due
on or before the Closing Date (taking into account valid extensions). All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practices of the Petro-
Hunt Parties with respect to Tax Returns for the Properties. Buyer shall
timely prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed in
customary fashion all Tax Returns for Property Taxes relating to the
Properties due after the Closing Date (taking into account valid extensions)
for any period that ends on, before, or after the Closing Date.

(b) All Property Taxes related to the Properties shall be pro-rated between
Petro-Hunt Successor and Pillar Successor, on the one hand, and Petro-Hunt
FB/M Successor and Pillar FB/M Successor, on the other, as of the Effective
Time. Petro-Hunt Successor and Pillar Successor shall be charged for and
obligated to pay and shall indemnify Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar FB/M
Successor against all such Property Taxes based on ownership of
the Properties prior to the Effective Time, as contemplated in the
adjustments under _Section 2.02(b)_. Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar
FB/M Successor shall be charged for and obligated to pay and shall indemnify
Petro-Hunt Successor and Pillar Successor against all such Property Taxes
based on ownership of the Properties after the Effective Time. For purposes of
the provisions of this _Section 4.03(b)_, (i) the proration of Property Taxes
shall be computed on a per diem or actual production basis, whichever is
applicable, and (ii) the proration of any other Taxes not described in (i)
shall be computed on an actual closing of the books basis as of the Closing
Date recognizing general federal income tax principles. Each party will be
entitled to any refund, credit or offset with respect to Property Taxes paid
by that party pursuant to this _Section 4.03_. If a party receives a refund,
credit or offset to which the other party is entitled, the party receiving
the refund, credit or offset shall forward payment for same to the party
entitled to the refund, credit or offset within 30 business days after
receipt. For purposes of this Agreement and this _Section 4.03_, " _Property
Taxes_ " means ad valorem, property, excise, severance, production or similar
Taxes (including any interest, fine, penalty, or additions to Tax imposed by a
governmental authority in connection with such Taxes) based upon operation or
ownership of the Properties or the production of hydrocarbons therefrom, but
excluding all other Taxes.

(c) To the extent legally permissible and desirable, the Petro-Hunt Parties
and Buyer will reasonably cooperate and cause their respective affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to reasonably
cooperate in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes.

 

(d) To the extent there may be any, all sales taxes occasioned by the Mergers
or the sale of the Membership Interests hereunder and all documentary, filing
and recording fees required in connection with the filing and recording of

 



31  any assignments (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by Buyer. Each
party shall reasonably cooperate with the other to help minimize the Transfer
Taxes through any reasonable means that conforms to the law.

(e) For purposes of this _Section 4.03_ and this Agreement, it is
specifically understood and agreed that, other than the Transfer Taxes
described in _Section 4.03(d)_, above, any and all income, gains, franchise
and similar Taxes resulting from the sale by Petro-Hunt Holdings and
Pillar Holdings of the Membership Interests at Closing shall be the
obligation and liability of the Petro-Hunt Parties and the Petro-Hunt Parties
shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from all such Taxes.

 

4.04 _Hart-Scott-Rodino; Regulatory Approvals._ The parties shall cooperate
with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation (including Notification
and Report Forms, if required, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") (which, if required,
shall be filed within ten business days of the date hereof)), to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations
of all third parties and governmental authorities that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act, to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all such
governmental authorities. Each of the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer shall have
the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to the Petro-Hunt
Parties and Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their respective
subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any governmental authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, both parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
of the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer shall consult with each other with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, clearances and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each will keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or other
communications received by the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer, as the case may
be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
governmental entity with respect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the Petro-Hunt
Parties or Buyer to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties

 



32  or governmental authorities, that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer. Each of the Petro-
Hunt Parties and Buyer shall promptly advise the other party upon receiving
any communication from any governmental authority the consent or approval of
which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed, and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
provide the other party with a copy of such communication.

_ARTICLE V._

 

 _Title and Defects_

5.01 _Defensible Title_.

in _Exhibit "A", Part I_ )) to a Net Revenue Interest of not less than the Net
Revenue Interest set forth for such Undeveloped Lease on _Exhibit "A", Part
I_ ; and

(4) with respect to each Undeveloped Lease, results in the Petro-Hunt Parties
owning not less than the number of net mineral acres attributable to such
Undeveloped Lease (as to the depths set forth on _Exhibit "A", Part I_ , and
excluding, for purposes hereof, net mineral acres allocable to the Allocated
Units for the Wells) equal to the net mineral acres for such Undeveloped Lease
set forth on _Exhibit "A", Part I_.

5.02 _Permitted Encumbrances_.

As used herein " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " means the following items
relating to the Properties, provided that they do not operate to (i) increase
the Working Interest of Petro-Hunt Parties set forth on _Exhibit "C"_ or 
_Exhibit "A", Part I_ , as applicable, for any of the Properties without a
corresponding increase in the applicable Net Revenue Interest, or (ii)
decrease in the Net Revenue Interest of Petro-Hunt Parties set forth on

easements and rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of any of the Properties,
that are not such as to interfere materially with the operation, development,
value or use of the Properties;

(h) rights reserved to or vested in any municipality or governmental,
statutory or public authority to control or regulate any of the Properties in
any manner, and all applicable laws, rules and orders of governmental

(i) any (1) undetermined or inchoate liens or charges constituting or
securing the payment of expenses which were incurred incidental to
maintenance, development, production or operation of the Properties or for the
purpose of developing, producing or processing Hydrocarbons therefrom or
therein and (2) materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees,
contractors or other similar liens, security interests or charges for

Closing;

 

(k) the terms of all Contracts described on _Exhibit "B"_ ; and

 

(l) such Title Defects or other defects as Buyer has waived in writing.

 

5.03 _Title Defect_.

A Property shall be deemed to have a " _Title Defect_ " if the Petro-Hunt
Parties do not have Defensible Title thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the following shall be considered a Title Defect:

(a) defects in the chain of title consisting of the mere failure to recite
marital status in a document or successors of heirship proceedings in a
document, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure or
omission has resulted in another partys actual and superior claim of title to
the relevant Property; 

 



35 (b) lack of a survey, unless a survey is expressly required by
applicable laws or applicable contracts or agreements;

(c) defects that have been cured by actual adverse possession under
applicable statutes of limitation for adverse possession;

(d) defects that have been cured prior to Closing, to Buyers reasonable
satisfaction;

(e) proof of representative capacity on behalf of a corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or trust, unless it is clear from other
documentation that a signatory party has not signed a document in the proper
representative capacity;

 

(f) defects or irregularities resulting from or relating to probate
proceedings or the lack thereof, which defects or irregularities the Petro-
Hunt Parties have cured through the provision of evidence of title that is
otherwise reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Buyer; and

 

(g) defects based solely on the existence of prior oil and gas leases relating
to the Lands that have expired and are no longer in force and legal effect
but have not been released of record.

5.04 _Defective Interests and Environmental Defects_.

(a) As used herein " _Defective Interest_ " means

 

(1) that portion of a Property affected by a Title Defect; or

 

(2) that portion of the Properties adversely affected by the default of the
Petro-Hunt Parties, or any other party, under an obligation of the Leases or
Contracts.

(b) As used herein, " _Title Defect Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a
Defective Interest, the amount by which the value of such Defective Interest
is impaired as a result of the existence of one or more Title Defects, which
amount shall be determined as follows:

 

(1) If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien or encumbrance
(other than a Permitted Encumbrance), the Title Defect Value shall be an
amount sufficient to discharge such lien, not to exceed the Allocated Value of
the Defective Interest.

 



36 (2) If the Title Defect is based on a deficiency in the net mineral acres
of the Petro-Hunt Parties in an Undeveloped Lease from that set forth on
_Exhibit "A", Part I_ for such Undeveloped Lease, then the Title Defect Value
shall be an amount equal to the applicable Per Net Mineral Acre Price for
such Undeveloped Lease _multiplied by_ the number of net mineral acres the
Petro-Hunt Parties are so deficient in such Undeveloped Lease.

(3) If the Title Defect is based on a deficiency in the Net Revenue Interest
of the Petro-Hunt Parties in a Defective Interest from that set forth for such
Defective Interest on _Exhibit "A", Part I_ or _Exhibit "C"_ , as applicable,
then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the Allocated Value
for such Defective Interest _multiplied by_ the difference of (a) 1 minus (b)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue Interest of the
Petro-Hunt Parties in such Defective Interest, and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest for such Defective Interest set forth in _Exhibit
"A", Part I_ or _Exhibit "C"_ , as applicable.

(4) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(1), (2), or (3) above, the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
difference between the value of the Defective Interest with such Title Defect
and the value of such Defective Interest without such Title Defect (taking
into account the Allocated Value of such Defective Interest); provided,
however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured as
provided in this Agreement, the Title Defect Value shall be the reasonable
cost and expense of curing such Title Defect, if less, and such Title Defect
Value shall never exceed the Allocated Value of such Defective Interest.

(5) The Title Defect Value with respect to a Defective Interest shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Value hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a lien
affects more than one Defective Interest or the curative work with respect to
one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing
of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Defective Interest,
the aggregate amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense
of such curative work shall only be considered once with respect to all
applicable Title Defect Values and Defective Interests.

 

(6) The Title Defect Value attributable to a Defective Interest shall not
exceed the Allocated Value of such Defective Interest. All Title Defect
Values and related Purchase Price adjustments shall be made without
duplication.

 



37 (c) _Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Value._ As used herein "
_Environmental Defect_ " means any of the following conditions associated with
a Property: (1) Noncompliance by the Petro-Hunt Parties with applicable
Environmental Laws (defined in _Section 8.04_ below), or (2) any
Environmental Condition that exists on, at or under any of the Properties,
including, without limitation, those that may be in violation or require
action under any Environmental Law. As used herein "
_Environmental Condition_ " means any pollution, contamination, degradation,
damage or injury caused by, related to, arising from, or in connection with
the generation, handling, use, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal,
discharge, release, or emission of any Hazardous Materials (defined below) or
Contaminants (as defined below) on, at or under the Properties. As used herein
" _Environmental Defect Value_ " means, with respect to each Environmental
Defect, its Lowest Cost Response. As used herein " _Hazardous Materials_ "
means any (i) toxic or hazardous materials or substances; (ii) solid wastes,
including asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, flammable or
explosive materials; (iii) radioactive materials, including naturally
occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "); and (iv) any other chemical,
pollutant, contaminant, substance or waste that is regulated under any
Environmental Laws. As used herein, " _Contaminants_ " means any other
contaminant (including, without limitation, any petroleum or petroleum-derived
substances or wastes, or chlorides) not otherwise considered to be Hazardous
Materials but which would require remediation, clean-up or other action, if
spilled or were part of an uncontrolled released. As used herein " _Lowest
Cost Response_ " means the response required or allowed under Environmental
Laws that cures, remediates, removes or remedies the applicable present
condition alleged in a notice of an Environmental Defect at the lowest cost
(assuming that the affected Property continues to be used as an oil and gas
property) sufficient to comply with Environmental Laws (and is also
consistent with general industry standards) and to address any Environmental
Condition as compared to any other response that is allowed under
Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, costs of remediation and
clean-up, the cost of any penalties and fines, and the cost of changes or
actions that must be taken (including, without limitation, monitoring,
refurbishing, installations, or other actions) to comply with such
Environmental Laws and to address any Environmental Condition.

5.05 _Buyer s Right of Inspection_. From the date of this Agreement
and continuing until Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties will authorize Buyer and
its duly authorized representatives, contractors and subcontractors
(collectively " _Representatives_ ") the right of entry to operated and non-
operated Properties, subject to the terms of _Section 4.01(a)_ (" _Permitted
Activities_ "), subject to obtaining consent of any third party operator, if
the Petro-Hunt Parties are not the operator of the Property, and
subject further to the following conditions:

(a) Buyer shall notify the Petro-Hunt Parties at least 24 hours prior to such
entry of its desire to enter the selected portion(s) of the Properties to
conduct Permitted Activities.

 



38 (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the Petro-Hunt Parties shall allow Buyer and
its Representatives to enter the Properties during normal business hours to
conduct Permitted Activities. The Permitted Activities of Buyer and its
Representatives shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations or
business of the Petro-Hunt Parties, and Buyer and its Representatives shall
not remain on the Properties subsequent to the completion of their Permitted
Activities. The Petro-Hunt Parties or a representative of the Petro-Hunt
Parties shall have the right to be present for any inspection of the
Properties conducted by Buyer or its Representatives.

(c) Upon receipt of notice hereunder, Buyers authorized representatives may
(i) consult with the Petro-Hunt Parties and their third-party operators
agents and employees during reasonable business hours concerning those third
parties operations on the Properties, and (ii) conduct, at Buyers sole risk
and expense, on-site inspections, environmental assessments, reasonable tests
and inventories of the non-operated portions of the Properties.

 

(d) The Permitted Activities shall be conducted in a manner to not materially
interfere with the normal operations of the Petro-Hunt Parties.

(e) The Permitted Activities shall be conducted in accordance with all
applicable Environmental Laws, rules and regulations, and commonly accepted
standards for conducting such activities. Upon completion of its activity,
Buyer and its Representatives shall restore the Property to its condition
existing as of Buyers entry thereon and remove all equipment and materials
that were brought onto the Properties by Buyer and its Representatives. As
soon as reasonably possible, Buyer shall provide the Petro-Hunt Parties with a
copy of all written reports prepared for Buyer as a result of conducting
Permitted Activities.

(f) Buyer will be responsible for the conduct and protection of all of its
personnel and representatives involved in the Permitted Activities. The Petro-
Hunt Parties shall not have any right to control and shall not exercise any
responsibility with respect to the Permitted Activities conducted by Buyer on
the Properties, except that the Petro-Hunt Parties shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to prevent any damage to its property or disruption to its
business. Buyer and its Representatives will undertake all measures reasonably
necessary to protect all persons conducting the Permitted Activities on the
Properties and any other persons who may enter the Properties during or after
completion of the Permitted Activities.

 



39 (g) Neither Buyer nor its Representatives shall contact any federal,
state, or local agency with respect to environmental conditions discovered on
the Properties without the prior written permission and consent of the Petro-
Hunt Parties, except as may be otherwise required by applicable law, rule or
regulation. To the extent practicable, any proposal of Buyer or its
Representatives to contact any federal, state, or local agency shall be
delivered in writing to the Petro-Hunt Parties for review and approval, except
as may be otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation.

(h) BUYER AGREES TO FULLY INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES,
THEIR AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
CONTRACTORS, AND THIRD PARTY OPERATORS OF ANY OF THE INTERESTS OF THE PETRO-
HUNT PARTIES IN THE PROPERTIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS,
LIABILITIES, CAUSES OF ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS OR DEFENSE EXPENSES (INCLUDING
REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPERT EXPENSES) OF ANY PERSON, INCLUDING BUYER,
ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND
CONTRACTORS, ATTRIBUTABLE TO OR ARISING FROM THE PERMITTED ACTIVITIES,
INCLUDING (I) PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON, (II) ACTUAL DAMAGE TO
THE PROPERTY OF THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES, BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON, AND (III)
ALL OTHER ACTUAL DAMAGES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO OR ARISING FROM THE PERMITTED
ACTIVITIES, REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, EXCEPT THERE SHALL BE
NO LIABILITY OF BUYER TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH INJURY, DAMAGE, OR LOSS IS CAUSED
BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES, OR
ANY OF THE CONTRACTORS, THIRD PARTY OPERATORS, OR OTHER INVITEES OF THE
PETRO-HUNT PARTIES, NOR SHALL THERE BE ANY LIABILITY OF BUYER TO THE PETRO-
HUNT PARTIES BASED ON THE INFORMATION OBTAINED; AND PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING STATED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, ANY DAMAGES COVERED
HEREBY SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES, AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE BY THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD
PARTY.

 



40 5.06 _Notice of Defective Interests and Environmental Defects_

 

(a) _Notice; Thresholds._ Buyer shall give the Petro-Hunt Parties notice of
Defective Interests and Environmental Defects not later than five (5)
business days prior to Closing. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the Defective Interest or the Environmental
Defect, as applicable, (ii) the reason Buyer believes such Properties to be a
Defective Interest or affected by an Environmental Defect, and (iii) to the
extent known or susceptible to reasonable estimation, the Title Defect Value
or Environmental Defect Values asserted by Buyer with respect to the asserted
Defective Interest or Environmental Defect, as applicable. Buyers notice(s)
of Defective Interests shall not be effective unless and until (i) the
asserted individual Title Defect Value of any single Defective
Interest exceeds $75,000 (and to the extent such threshold is exceeded, the
entire Title Defect Value for such Defective Interest shall be recoverable),
and (ii) the total of the asserted Title Defect Values for the asserted
Defective Interests when combined with the total of the asserted
Environmental Defect Values for all asserted Environmental Defects exceeds an
aggregate threshold equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price
(and if such aggregate 0.5% threshold is exceeded, the entire Title Defect
Value for such Defective Interests shall be recoverable). Buyers notice(s) of
Environmental Defects shall not be effective unless and until (x) the asserted
Environmental Defect Value of any single Environmental Defect exceeds $75,000
(and to the extent such threshold is exceeded, the entire Environmental Defect
Value for such Environmental Defect shall be recoverable) and (y) the total of
the asserted Environmental Defect Values for all of the
asserted Environmental Defects when combined with the total of all of the
asserted Title Defect Values for all asserted Defective Interests exceeds an
aggregate threshold equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price
(and if such 0.5% threshold is exceeded, the entire Title Defect Value for
such Defective Interests shall be recoverable). Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived all Defective Interests of which the Petro-Hunt Parties has not been
given such notice within the time period prescribed in this _Section
5.06(a)_. Except for claims that Buyer would have for breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.01(q)_ and except with regard to
any of the Petro-Hunt Party Obligations (as hereinafter defined), Buyer shall
be deemed to have waived all Environmental Defects of which the Petro-Hunt
Parties have not been given such notice within the time period prescribed in
this _Section 5.06(a)_.

 

(b) _Right to Counter-Notice._ Upon being notified by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 5.06(a)_ of any asserted Defective Interest or Environmental
Defect, the Petro-Hunt Parties shall give written counter-notice to Buyer
within three (3) business days (i) that the Petro-Hunt Parties either (A) will
attempt to correct the asserted Defective Interest or remediate the asserted
Environmental Defect or (B) do not intend to attempt to correct the asserted
Defective Interest or remediate the asserted Environmental Defect; (ii)
whether the Petro-Hunt Parties agree or disagree that the asserted Defective
Interest or Environmental Defect exists, and (iii) whether the Petro-Hunt
Parties agree or disagree with the Title Defect Value or Environmental Defect
Value asserted by the Buyer. If the Petro-Hunt Parties notify Buyer that it
does not intend to attempt to correct the asserted

 



41  Defective Interest or remediate the asserted Environmental Defect, then (x)
Buyer may elect to reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value or the
Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer, or (y) if Buyer does not elect
(x) above, then solely as to Properties affected by Environmental Defects,
Buyer or the Petro-Hunt Parties may elect to exclude any affected Properties
from the properties and assets to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor or Pillar
FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers. If the affected Properties
are to be excluded, the Purchase Price at Closing will be reduced by the
Allocated Value for such Properties and such Properties shall thereafter be
considered Excluded Assets. If the Petro-Hunt Parties fails to give a counter-
notice hereunder prior to Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties will be deemed to
have waived any right to dispute or disagree with the Defective Interest
or Environmental Defect noticed under this _Section 5.06(b)_, and (x) Buyer
may elect to reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value or the
Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer or (y) if Buyer does not
elect (x) above, then solely as to Properties affected by Environmental
Defects, Buyer or the Petro-Hunt Parties may elect to exclude any affected
Properties from the properties and assets to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor
or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers.

(c) _Cure Period._ If the Petro-Hunt Parties give counter-notice of intent to
attempt to correct any asserted Defective Interest or remediate any asserted
Environmental Defect, under 5.06(b) above, and assuming this Agreement is not
otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, the Petro-Hunt
Parties shall have a period of 150 days from the receipt of Buyers notice
(the " _Cure Period_ ") to attempt to correct such asserted Defective Interest
or remediate the asserted Environmental Defect at their own expense using
the Lowest Cost Response as provided herein. Unless the parties agree
otherwise in writing, the Closing shall not be extended, but to the extent and
only to the extent that the Title Defect Value allocated to the Defective
Interest when combined with the value of all other asserted Defective
Interests and Environmental Defects exceeds the aggregate threshold of one-
half percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price (and if the aggregate threshold is
met, the entire Title Defect Value for such Defective Interest shall be
recoverable), a downward adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made
according to _Section 2.02(b)(3)_, taking into account applicable thresholds.
Within the Cure Period, if the Petro-Hunt Parties subsequently cures any
asserted Defective Interest or remediates an Environmental Defect, the cured
Title Defect Value or Environmental Defect Value will either be credited to
the Petro-Hunt Parties in the Final Settlement according to _Section 8.01_
hereof; or, if an affected Property was excluded from the properties and
assets to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as
a result of the Mergers, then subject to the other terms and conditions of
this Agreement the affected Property shall be deemed to be included in the
properties and assets to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar FB/M
Successor succeed as a result of the Mergers as of the effective date of the
Mergers at a supplemental closing held within ten (10) days following the end
of the Cure Period (and to the extent requested by Buyer, the parties shall
execute such amendments to the articles of merger or execute and deliver such
conveyances as may be necessary to accomplish such result) _._

 



42 (d) _Dispute on Existence of Defect._ If the Petro-Hunt Parties give counter-
notice according to _Section 5.06(b)_ and dispute a Defective Interest or
Environmental Defect, then its existence, Title Defect Value, or Environmental
Defect Value will be determined by arbitration pursuant to  _Section 5.07_
hereof.

(e) _Applicable Portions of Properties._ To the extent possible _, _ the
parties will only include that portion of the Properties actually affected by
the Defective Interests or Environmental Defect in determining how to treat
the Properties under this Agreement.

 

5.07 _Arbitration Procedures_. If any matter is required by this Article to be
arbitrated, such arbitration shall be conducted as set forth in this _Section
5.07_.

(a) The parties shall jointly select an acceptable, independent person to
serve as the sole arbitrator under this Agreement. The arbitrator for any
Title Defects submitted for arbitration shall be an oil and gas title attorney
licensed in the State of North Dakota and Board Certified by the State Bar of
North Dakota in the area of Oil, Gas and Energy Resource Law with at least ten
(10) years experience with oil and gas title review regarding properties in
North Dakota. The arbitrator for any Environmental Defect submitted
for arbitration shall be a licensed environmental attorney with at least ten
(10) years experience, and specific experience regarding environmental issues
associated with oil and gas properties. If the parties are unable to agree
upon the designation of a person as arbitrator under this _Section 5.07_,
then either the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer, or both such parties, may in
writing request the American Arbitration Association to appoint a qualified,
independent arbitrator, based on the criteria described above.

(b) Any arbitration hearing shall be held at a place acceptable to
the arbitrator in Dallas, Texas.

(c) The arbitrator shall settle disputes regarding the existence of
Defective Interests and/or the Title Defect Value thereof and of
Environmental Defects and/or the Environmental Defect Value thereof and the
Petro-Hunt Parties attempts to correct any Title Defects or remediate any
Environmental Defects in accordance with the then in force Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA Rules_ ").
Such arbitrator shall hear all arbitration matters arising under this Article
V. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon the parties, and may
be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Petro-Hunt Parties and
Buyer, respectively, shall bear their own legal fees and other costs incurred
in presenting their respective cases. The charges and expenses of the
arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer.

 



43 (d) The arbitration shall commence within ten days after the arbitrator
is selected as set forth in _Section 5.07(a)_ above. In fulfilling his
duties hereunder, the arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. In fulfilling any of his arbitration duties, the arbitrator may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the arbitrator are necessary
or helpful to make a proper evaluation. Additionally, the arbitrator may
consult with and engage disinterested third parties, including, without
limitation, petroleum engineers, attorneys and consultants, to advise the
arbitrator.

(e) If any arbitrator selected hereunder should die, resign or be unable to
perform his duties hereunder, the parties, or if the parties are unable to
agree, the American Arbitration Association shall select a replacement
arbitrator. The aforesaid procedure shall be followed from time to time as
necessary. 

5.08 _Effect of Disputed Defective Interests or Environmental Defects on
Closing_. If Buyer asserts any Defective Interests or Environmental Defects
that are disputed and referred to arbitration under _Section 5.07_ hereof,
the following shall apply:

(a) If any matter is referred to arbitration under _Section 5.07_ of this
Agreement and the Title Defect Value or Environmental Defect Value asserted by
Buyer with respect to the matters under arbitration when combined with all
other adjustments described above with regard to asserted Defective Interests
and asserted Environmental Defects (together with the values and the
adjustments associated with casualty losses, un-obtained consents, exercised
preferential purchase rights, disputed Defective Interests or Environmental
Defects, or removed and excluded Properties, or other adjustments) totals less
than $217,500,000, then, subject to the satisfaction of the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the parties shall proceed to Closing, and
the Properties affected by the asserted Defective Interests and Environmental
Defects shall be included within the properties and assets to which Petro-Hunt
FB/M Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers,
and the Closing Amount (defined below) shall be reduced by the aggregate
amount equal to the asserted Title Defect Values of the asserted Defective
Interests and asserted Environmental Defect Values of the asserted
Environmental Defects. If the arbitrator decides that any Defective Interest
or Environmental Defect asserted by the Buyer is not a Defective Interest or
Environmental Defect, then the applicable Title Defect Value or Environmental
Defect Value withheld from the Closing Amount for Properties conveyed to Buyer
at Closing shall be paid to New DE PH and Pillar Holdings within thirty (30)
days after such determination. If the arbitrator decides that any one or more
of the Defective Interests or Environmental Defects asserted by the Buyer are
in fact Defective Interests or Environmental Defects, and if the Title Defect
Value and the Environmental Defect Value of such Defective Interests or
Environmental Defects as determined by the arbitrator, when combined with all
other Defective Interests and Environmental Defects exceeds one-half percent
(0.5%) of the Purchase Price, then Buyer shall retain the applicable Title
Defect Value or Environmental Defect Value withheld from the Closing Amount
with respect to the applicable Properties.

 



44 (b) If any matter is referred to arbitration under _Section 5.07_ of this
Agreement and the Title Defect Value or Environmental Defect Value asserted by
Buyer with respect to the matters under arbitration when combined with all
other adjustments to the Purchase Price relating to Defective Interests
and Environmental Defects (as well as casualty losses, un-obtained consents,
exercised preferential purchase rights, disputed Defective Interests or
Environmental Defects, or removed and excluded Properties, or other
adjustments) totals $217,500,000 or more, and this Agreement is not
terminated by the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer pursuant to Article IX hereof,
then the Closing shall not be postponed and the parties shall close and
consummate the transactions at the closing and only the Properties as to
which there is no such dispute related to Defective Interests and
Environmental Defects will be included as assets to which Petro-Hunt FB/M
Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers (and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values for such excluded
Properties). If the arbitrator decides that any Defective Interest or
Environmental Defect asserted by the Buyer is not a Defective Interest or
Environmental Defect, then the parties shall have a supplemental within
thirty (30) days of such determination, at which time, such applicable
Properties will be deemed to have been included in the Properties to which
Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeded as a result
of the Mergers as of the effective time of the Mergers in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (and to the extent requested by Buyer,
the parties shall execute such amendments to the articles of merger or execute
and deliver such conveyances as may be necessary to accomplish such result),
and Buyer shall pay the Allocated Value attributable to such applicable
Properties, subject to the adjustments provided for in this Agreement relative
thereto. If the arbitrator decides that any one or more of the Defective
Interests or Environmental Defects asserted by the Buyer are in fact Defective
Interests or Environmental Defects, and if the Title Defect Value and the
Environmental Defect Value of such Defective Interests or Environmental
Defects as determined by the arbitrator, when combined with all other
Defective Interests and Environmental Defects exceed one-half percent (0.5%)
of the Purchase Price, then, at Buyers election, the affected Properties
shall either be deemed to be Excluded Assets or the parties shall schedule a
supplemental Closing within thirty (30) days after such determination, at
which time, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
Properties will be deemed to have been included in the Properties to which
Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeded as a result of
the Mergers as of the effective time of the Mergers (and to the extent
requested by Buyer, the parties shall execute such amendments to the articles
of merger or execute and deliver such conveyances as may be necessary to
accomplish such result) and Buyer shall pay to the Petro-Hunt Parties the
Allocated Value, less the asserted Title Defect Value or Environmental Defect
Value, as applicable, and subject to the other adjustments

 



45  contemplated in this Agreement related thereto (and to the extent requested
by Buyer, the parties shall execute such amendments to the articles of merger
or execute and deliver such conveyances as may be necessary to accomplish
such result).

5.09 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Within five (5) business days following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Petro-Hunt Parties will
provide written notice in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer to any
persons under the Lease, Contract or agreement requiring a preferential
purchase, right of first refusal, or similar option (a " _Preferential Right_
"). Upon receipt of notice hereunder, the Petro-Hunt Parties will notify Buyer
within five (5) business days of (a) any Preferential Rights exercised,
waived or deemed waived, or (b) lapse of the requisite time periods without
exercise of such Preferential Rights. Subject to the conditions in _Section
6.02(d)_ and the right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 9.01(c)_
hereof), if a Preferential Right is duly exercised prior to Closing, the
affected Properties shall be deemed Excluded Assets, and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value thereof. However, five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date, if a Preferential Right has not been waived or exercised,
and the requisite exercise period for such Preferential Right have not
elapsed, then the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer may exclude the
affected Properties from the assets and properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M
Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers, adjust
the Purchase Price downward by the Allocated Value of such Properties, and
such affected Properties shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets; _provided_ ,
_however_ __, that if the required waiver of Preferential Rights is obtained
within ninety (90) days after Closing, the affected Properties will be deemed
to have been included in the Properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor or
Pillar FB/M Successor succeeded as a result of the Mergers as of the effective
time of the Mergers (and to the extent requested by Buyer, the parties shall
execute such amendments to the articles of merger or execute and deliver such
conveyances as may be necessary to accomplish such result), and Buyer will pay
the Allocated Value thereof to Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings
(subject to adjustments provided herein), within ten (10) business days of
written notice by the Petro-Hunt Parties to Buyer that such Preferential
Rights have been waived (with a copy of the evidence thereof).

5.10 _Casualty Losses_. Prior to Closing Date, if, all or a material part of
any of the Properties are damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, storm or other
casualty (" _Casualty Loss_ "), or same are taken in condemnation or by
eminent domain, or if proceedings for such purposes are pending or threatened
(" _Government Taking_ "), the Petro-Hunt Parties must promptly notify Buyer
in writing thereof and their estimated cost to repair or replace that portion
of the Properties affected by the Casualty Loss or value of the Properties
taken by the Government Taking. If all or any portion of the Properties is
affected by Casualty Loss or Government Taking, the Purchase Price will be
adjusted downward by the agreed dollar amount of the Casualty Loss or
Government Taking. If the parties cannot agree on the appropriate amount, and
Buyer does not elect the options described below, then the appropriate amount
will be determined pursuant to an arbitration procedure similar to the one
described in _Section 5.07_, and the affected Properties will be excluded
from the assets and properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M

  



46  Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers for
purposes of the Closing, and the Purchase Price reduced by the Allocated Value
thereof, and the parties will then close, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement. At Buyers sole election, in lieu of adjustments
to the Purchase Price, Buyer may elect to receive and the Petro-Hunt Parties
shall immediately pay over to Buyer when actually received: (i) all insurance
proceeds payable to the Petro-Hunt Parties with respect to any Casualty Loss,
(ii) all sums paid to the Petro-Hunt Parties by third parties for any such
Casualty Loss, (iii) all compensation paid to the Petro-Hunt Parties with
respect to any Government Taking. In addition to the remedies set forth
hereinabove, the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer will have the termination rights
in _Section 9.01(c)_ as to Casualty Losses and Government Takings.

5.11 _Consents_. Within five (5) days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Petro-Hunt Parties will provide written notice in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer to any persons under any Lease
or Contract requiring a right to consent to the conveyance of any Properties
hereunder, including, without limitation, those set forth on _Schedule
3.01(d)_. Upon receipt of notice hereunder, the Petro-Hunt Parties will notify
Buyer within two (2) business days of (a) any requested consents which are
denied, or (b) the lapse of requisite time periods for such consents to be
given and received, together with a summary of which required consents, if
any, remain outstanding. However, five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, if
the requisite time for such consent has not elapsed and the consent is not
waived, the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer may exclude the affected Properties
from the assets and properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor of Pillar
FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers, adjust the Purchase Price
downward by the Allocated Value of such Properties, and such affected
Properties shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets; provided _,_ further,
however _,_ that if the required consent is obtained within ninety (90)
days after Closing, the affected Properties will be deemed to have been
included in the Properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor of Pillar FB/M
Successor succeeded as a result of the Mergers as of the effective time of the
Mergers (and to the extent requested by Buyer, the parties shall execute such
amendments to the articles of merger or execute and deliver such conveyances
as may be necessary to accomplish such result), and Buyer will pay for the
Allocated Value thereof to Petro-Hunt Holdings and Pillar Holdings (subject
to other adjustments provided herein), within thirty (30) days of written
notice by the Petro-Hunt Parties to Buyer that such consent has been waived
(with a copy of the evidence thereof).

 



47 5.12 _Upward Adjustment_. If (a) Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar
FB/M Successor own more than the net mineral acres set forth on _Exhibit "A",
Part I_ allocable to the Undeveloped Leases (and excluding, for purposes
hereof, net mineral acres allocable to the Allocated Unit for a Well) or (b)
Petro-Hunt FB/M Successor and Pillar FB/M Successor own a Net Revenue Interest
in either the Wells (and the associated Allocated Unit) or the Undeveloped
Leases that exceeds the amounts set forth on _Exhibit "A", Part I_ and 
_Exhibit "C"_ , respectively for such ell or Undeveloped Lease, then there may
be set-off against the Title Defect Value of the Defective Interests, in
accordance with the terms hereof (the " _Upward Adjustment_ "), provided,
however, that this ability to offset are subject to and limited by the
following:

(i) there shall be no Upward Adjustment available for such offset to the
extent either: (1) the individual increase available for offset would not
exceed $75,000 (and to the extent such threshold is exceeded, or the entire
amount will be credited as an Upward Adjustment), or (2) the aggregate value
of all such Upward Adjustments, all of which exceed the individual threshold
described in subpart (i)(1) above, would not exceed an aggregate threshold
equal to 0.5% of the Purchase Price;

 

(ii) with regard to Upward Adjustments based on additional net mineral acres
which are not reflected in _Exhibit A, Part I_ , such additional net mineral
acres may only be used to offset deficiencies in net mineral acres
attributable to the Undeveloped Leases insofar and only insofar as the
additional net mineral acres being used to offset are in the same
geographic area and would have the same Per Net Mineral Acre Price as those
they are offsetting (and if they are not otherwise in the same geographic area
which would be included in the same Per Net Mineral Acre Price, then any
ability to use the same to offset or the value thereof shall be based solely
on the mutual agreement of the parties on the same);

(iii) with regard to Upward Adjustments relative to increased Net Revenue
Interests, the value thereof shall be based on the Allocated Value of the
applicable Property and calculated in a manner similar to the calculation of
the Title Defect Value, and 

(iv) notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, if the aggregate
Upward Adjustment (or Acreage Adjustment), or the value thereof, exceeds the
aggregate Title Defect Values of all Defective Interests asserted, there shall
be no upward adjustment of the Purchase Price, and the same may ONLY be used
to offset the Title effect Value of asserted Defective Interests, as
described above; and

(v) The Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer agree that: (1) the net mineral acres
reflected on _Exhibit A, Part I_ allocable to the Undeveloped Leases include
1,754 more net mineral acres than have been allocated value for purposes of
calculating the Purchase Price (with no upward adjustment to the
Purchase Price for the same); and (2) should there be Title Defects
discovered that result in a reduction in net mineral acres allocable to the
Undeveloped Leases included in the transaction, there shall be no Title Defect
Value applied to the aggregate defect threshold of 0.5% of the Purchase Price
(as described above), except to the extent that the reduction in net mineral
acres exceeds 1,754 net mineral acres (the " _Acreage Adjustment_ "), insofar
and only insofar as the net mineral acres attributable to the Acreage
Adjustment are in the same geographic area and would have the same Per Net
Mineral Acre Price (if such net mineral acres had, in fact,

 



48  been valued for purposes of the calculation of the Purchase Price) as those
they are offsetting, as described in subpart (ii) above (and if they are not,
then the Acreage Adjustment shall not restrict the application of the Title
Defect Value for such Defective Interests as otherwise contemplated in this
Agreement).

5.13 _Exclusive Remedy_. THIS ARTICLE V SHALL, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY OF THE PARTIES
WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM RELATED TO TITLE MATTERS (INCLUDING TITLE DEFECTS
OR ANY CLAIM UNDER _SECTION 5.01_ ). IN ADDITION, EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING

BASED ON, RELATING TO, OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY CLAIM RELATED TO TITLE MATTERS
OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO A BREACH OF THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN _SECTION 3.01(q)_ AND EXCEPT FOR MATTERS
CONSTITUTING PETRO-HUNT PARTY OBLIGATIONS OF THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES).

established, shall be herein called the " _Final Settlement Date._ "

(b) If the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer cannot agree on the Final Purchase
Price within 150 days from the Closing Date, independent certified public
accountants approved by Buyer and the Petro-Hunt Parties will act as
arbitrators to decide all points of disagreement with respect to the Final
Purchase Price. Such decision will be binding upon all parties. If the parties
cannot agree on independent certified public accountants to use, then
Buyer shall select one independent, certified public accountant firm, and the
Petro-Hunt Parties shall select one independent, certified public accountant
firm, and the two selected by the respective parties shall be charged with
selecting one independent, certified

 



54  public accountant firm to be used for such purposes. If no independent
certified public accountants are willing or able to serve under this _Section
8.01(b)_, the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer will designate in good faith
another acceptable independent certified public accountant as the sole
arbitrator under this Section. If the parties are unable to agree upon such
substitute arbitrator, then the Petro-Hunt Parties or Buyer, or both of them,
may request in writing that the American Arbitration Association appoint a
substitute independent certified public accountant arbitrator. The arbitration
shall be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms hereof. The costs and
expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Petro-Hunt Parties
and Buyer. Within five (5) business days after the final decision of the
arbitrator or agreement of the parties, the Buyer or the Petro-Hunt Parties,
as the case may be, shall promptly pay to the other such amount as is due to
arrive at the Final Purchase Price, together with interest on the amount of
such payment at the rate of 3% per annum, compounded monthly since the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 8.01(b)_, any
questions with respect to a Defective Interest, Title Defect Value,
Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Value shall be resolved pursuant
to the terms of _Article V_ hereof.

__8.02 _Transition Services_. _ _ Before the Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties
and Buyer agree to negotiate in good faith a form of Transition Services
Agreement (the " _TSA_ "), whereby the Petro-Hunt Parties will agree to
provide certain transition services to Buyer related to the operation and
management of the Properties. The TSA shall provide and describe which
services that the Petro-Hunt Parties will provide to Buyer, what time frame,
and adequate compensation to the Petro-Hunt Parties from Buyer with regard
thereto. __

8.03 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, the Petro-Hunt Parties and Buyer
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be executed, acknowledged
and delivered such instruments, certificates, notices, filings, and documents,
and each will take such other action including payment of monies, to the
extent required hereunder, in each case to carry out their obligations under
this Agreement and under any document, certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant hereto or required by law to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to vest title in any properties, rights,
and assets in the proper person upon resolution or cure of any dispute
hereunder.

 

8.04 _Buyer s Post-Closing Obligations_.

 

(a) _Environmental Laws._ As used in this Agreement, " _Environmental Laws_ "
means all laws, as they exist on the date hereof, relating to (i) the control
of any pollutant or potential pollutant or protection of the air, water, land
or the environment, (ii) solid, gaseous or liquid waste generation, handling,
treatment, storage, disposal or transportation, or (iii) exposure to
hazardous, toxic, explosive, corrosive or other substances alleged to be
harmful, including but not limited to, the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §7401 _et_
_seq_., the Clean Water Act 33 U.S.C. §1251 _et_ _seq_., the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §6901 _et_ _seq_.,

 



55  the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, 42 U.S.C. §11001
_et_ _seq_., the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §300f _et_ _seq_., and the

regulations promulgated thereunder, or any amendments thereof.

 

(b) _Environmental Acknowledgement_. Buyer acknowledges that the Properties
have been used for exploration, development, production, handling,
transporting and/or processing of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, drilling fluids and chemicals, or other Hazardous Materials
located on or under the Properties or associated with the premises in
quantities typical for oilfield or gas operations in the areas in which the
Properties are located. Some equipment and sites included in the Properties
may contain naturally occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "), asbestos,
or other Hazardous Materials. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of
wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms; the wells,
materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included in the
Properties may contain NORM, asbestos, or other Hazardous Materials; and NORM-
containing material and other Hazardous Materials may have been buried or
otherwise been disposed of on the Properties. Special procedures may be
required for the remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of NORM or
other Hazardous Materials from the Properties. The mere presence of such
materials on the Properties shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach
of the Petro-Hunt Parties representation made in _Section 3.01(q)_,
provided that such materials listed in this paragraph: (i) have been used and
managed by the Petro-Hunt Parties in material compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and (ii) the presence of such materials does not form the
basis for any material environmental liability or material obligation to
cleanup, correct, abate, or to take any response, remedial or corrective
action under or pursuant to any Environmental Laws. Nothing contained in this
_Section 8.04(b)_ shall limit any remedies the parties may otherwise have
pursuant to Article V of this Agreement or under this Article VIII.

this Agreement " _FB/M Obligations_ " means: solely with regard to the
Properties included within the assets and properties to which Petro-Hunt FB/M
Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor succeeds as a result of the Mergers (except
for duties, obligations, claims and liabilities arising from a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Petro-Hunt Parties under this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument delivered in connection herewith),
(i) the following duties, obligations, claims and liabilities, arising from,
based upon, related to or associated with the Properties, regardless of

asserted Environmental Defects which have been cured or for which the
Purchase Price has been adjusted, (x) the plugging and abandonment of any
existing Wells constituting part of the Properties, (y) responsibility for
proper disbursement of any amounts held in suspense by the Petro-Hunt
Parties regarding the Properties (expressly limited to

 



56  the amounts paid, attributed, or credited to Buyer for same at Closing), and
(z) any matter for which Buyer received an express downward adjustment to the
Purchase Price under _Sections 2.02(b)(2)_ , _2.02(b)(3)_ or _2.02(b)(4)_

at Closing); (ii) Property Taxes attributable to the period and operation of
the Properties after the Effective Time; and (iii) all other duties,

_Sections 8.05(c)(i)_ and _8.05(c)(ii)_ , any violation of, or the failure to
perform any obligation imposed by any Environmental Laws, insofar and only
insofar as attributable to periods and operations on the Properties from and
after the Closing Date). Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary, it
is the intent of the parties that the Petro-Hunt FB/M Obligations be the
only obligations and liabilities assumed or made the responsibility of Petro-
Hunt FB/M Successor or Pillar FB/M Successor to which they succeed as a result
of the Mergers.

Properties, known or unknown, arising or attributable periods prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, the Petro-Hunt Party Obligations shall also be
deemed to include any other liabilities or obligations of any kind or
character relating to any assets, interests, businesses or items not otherwise
included as part of the Properties or part of the Petro-Hunt FB/M Obligations;
and Petro-Hunt Successor and Pillar Successor shall assume and be delegated
all Petro-Hunt Party Obligations, which they succeed to as a result of the
Mergers. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, the following duties, obligations, claims and liabilities are also
expressly included as Petro-Hunt Party Obligations:

(2) those attributable to any personal injury, bodily injury, illness,
property damage or death claims related to the Properties which arose from
circumstances occurring prior to the Closing Date;

or other commitment relating to, or constituting part of, the Properties,
insofar they are attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time; and

to the Properties which is not expressly assumed hereunder by Buyer.

(d) _Buyer s Indemnity_. UPON CLOSING, BUYER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, RELEASE,
DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS THE PETRO-HUNT PARTIES (EXCLUDING, PETRO-HUNT FB/M

Parties seismic and geophysical data relating to any of the Properties, with
such terms and duration as may be consistent with the Petro-Hunt Parties
rights thereto (but unless Buyer and the Petro-Hunt Parties otherwise mutually
agree to further restrictions, such license will to the extent it covers such
data that is owned by the Petro-Hunt Parties be a fully paid (royalty free),
perpetual license the Petro-Hunt Parties subject to any same restrictions that

_ARTICLE X._

 

 _Indemnification_

10.01 _Notice; Right to Employ Counsel_.

(a) When any indemnifiable claim, action, or suit relative to this Agreement
is filed or asserted in writing against any party hereto, the indemnified
party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of the same in writing,
specifying in detail the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining
thereto, and the indemnifying party shall, at its option, have the right to
assume the defense thereof or participate in the defense thereof and to employ
its own legal counsel in connection with such defense. Failure of the
indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of such claim, action, or
suit within twenty (20) calendar days after notice to the indemnified party of
such claim, action, or suit shall constitute a waiver of its rights
under this Article, unless such failure to notify within such time period
will not prejudice the rights of the indemnifying party in respect of such
claim, action or suit, in which case prompt notification as provided above
shall be sufficient. 

(b) The indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
counsel employed by the indemnifying party in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the indemnified party shall be at the sole expense of the
indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party shall have elected not or
shall have failed to assume or participate in the defense thereof, (ii) the
employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the
indemnifying party in writing, or (iii) the parties to any such
action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying and
indemnified party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,
and the indemnifying party or its counsel would be prohibited from asserting
such defenses under applicable ethical or procedural rules. In any of (i),
(ii), or (iii) above, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party and the
fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the indemnified party shall be
at the sole expense of the indemnifying party). 

 



63 (c) Prior to effectuating any settlement of any action or proceeding
under this _Section 10.01_, the indemnified party shall furnish the
indemnifying party with written notice of any proposed settlement in
sufficient time to allow the indemnifying party to act thereon. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action
or proceeding effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party.
Absent the written consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party
shall not effect a settlement of any claim without incorporating the complete
release of the indemnified party as a part of such settlement.

10.02 _Claim Reimbursement and Reduction_.

(a) Should the indemnified party realize any benefit, including any tax
benefit, resulting from any loss, liability, cost or damage for which such
indemnified party has been indemnified under this Article, at the time such
benefit is realized the indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying
party the dollar amount of the benefit realized.

(b) Any claim shall be reduced to the extent of any third party insurance or
condemnation payment actually received by the indemnified party or,
alternatively, at the option of the indemnified party, the rights of the
indemnified party against any insurer or governmental unit with respect to
such claim shall be assigned to the indemnifying party.
