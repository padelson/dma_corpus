<P align="left" style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:0%"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
designated by JPMorgan Chase and reasonably acceptable to Bank One (the
&#147;Exchange Agent&#148;), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence
of shares in book entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced shares of Bank One Common Stock (collectively, the &#147;Bank One

</FONT>


<P align="left" style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:0%"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
shares of Bank One Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time whose
shares were converted into shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.1, (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Bank One Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Bank One Certificates to the Exchange
Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
JPMorgan Chase and Bank One may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Bank One Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Bank One Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Bank
One Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Bank One Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II (after taking into
account all shares of Bank One Common Stock then held by such holder), and the
Bank One Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Bank One Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of Bank One, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Bank One Certificate representing such Bank One Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2, each
Bank One Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock into which the shares of Bank
One Common Stock represented by such Bank One Certificate have been converted
as provided in this Article&nbsp;II and the right to receive upon such surrender

there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares

fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Bank One Certificates evidencing Bank One Common
Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. In
lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Bank One Certificates, JPMorgan
Chase shall pay each holder of Bank One Common Stock an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the fractional share interest to which
such holder (after taking into account all shares of Bank One Common Stock held
at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b)&nbsp;the
closing price on the NYSE, as reported on the Consolidated Tape at the close of
the NYSE regular session of trading, for a share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock

and any stockholders of Bank One who have not theretofore complied with this
Article&nbsp;II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of their claim for JPMorgan Chase Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
respect to JPMorgan Chase Common Stock.

it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or

option to purchase shares of Bank One Common Stock (a &#147;Bank One Stock Option&#148;)
and each outstanding stock appreciation right (a &#147;Bank One SAR&#148;) or restricted
stock unit (a &#147;Bank One Unit&#148;) or other equity-based award or right in respect
of or based on the value of Bank One Common Stock (an &#147;Other Bank One Equity
Right&#148;) issued pursuant to any Bank One Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested,
shall be assumed by JPMorgan Chase, and each share of Bank One Common Stock
subject to restrictions that do not lapse upon the Effective Time (a &#147;Bank One
Restricted Share&#148;) shall be honored by JPMorgan Chase in accordance with their
terms following their conversion in the Merger into restricted shares of
JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Each Bank One Stock Option shall be deemed to
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Bank One Stock Option, the same number of shares of
JPMorgan Chase Common Stock as the holder of such Bank One Stock Option would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised
such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share, at a price per share equal to (y)&nbsp;the
exercise price per share of the shares of Bank One Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Bank One Stock Option divided by (z)&nbsp;the Exchange
Ratio, rounded to the nearest cent; <I>provided, however, </I>that in the case of any
option to which section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification
under section 422 of the Code (&#147;incentive stock options&#148;), the option price,
the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with
the method set forth above unless use of such method will not preserve the
status of such options as incentive stock options, in which case the manner of
determination shall be adjusted in a manner that both complies with Section
424(a) of the Code and results in the smallest modification in the economic
values that otherwise would be achieved by the holder pursuant to the method
set forth above.

stock appreciation rights of JPMorgan Chase (&#147;JPMorgan Chase SARs&#148;), determined
in the same manner as set forth above with respect to Bank One Stock Options
assumed by JPMorgan Chase. Each holder of a Bank One Unit shall be entitled to
that number of restricted stock units of JPMorgan Chase determined by
multiplying the number of Bank One Units held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. Each Other Bank One Equity Right
shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Bank One
Common Stock and shall be converted into a right or award with respect to
