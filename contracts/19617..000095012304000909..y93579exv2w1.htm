 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of January 14, 2004 (this "Agreement") between J.P. MORGAN CHASE and CO., a Delaware corporation ("JPMorgan Chase"), and BANK ONE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Bank One").    

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Bank One would merge with and into JPMorgan Chase (the "Merger");    

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals;    

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) as a condition and inducement to JPMorgan Chases willingness to enter into this Agreement and the JPMorgan Chase Stock Option Agreement referred to below, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One are entering into a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date hereof in the form of Exhibit 1.1(a) (the "Bank One Stock Option Agreement") pursuant to which Bank One is granting to JPMorgan Chase an option to purchase shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Bank One (the "Bank One Common Stock"); and (ii) as a condition and inducement to Bank Ones willingness to enter into this Agreement and the Bank One Stock Option Agreement, Bank One and JPMorgan Chase are entering into a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date hereof in the form of Exhibit 1.1(b) (the "JPMorgan Chase Stock Option Agreement"; and collectively with the Bank One Stock Option Agreement, the "Option Agreements"), pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase is granting to Bank One an option to purchase shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of JPMorgan Chase (the "JPMorgan Chase Common Stock");    

 WHEREAS, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and    

 WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g);    

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Option Agreements, the parties hereto agree as follows:    

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER    

 1.1. Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed by JPMorgan Chase as the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.3) and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.2). The Merger       ##### 

     

 2   

shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as is
provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").    

 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the "Closing Date") that is the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.    

 1.3. Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, Bank One shall be merged with and into JPMorgan Chase and the separate existence of Bank One shall cease. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. As used in this Agreement, "Constituent Corporations" shall mean each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One, and "Surviving Corporation" shall mean JPMorgan Chase, at and after the Effective Time, as the surviving corporation in the Merger.    

 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Certificate of Incorporation of JPMorgan Chase as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as amended as set forth in Exhibit 1.4(a), shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The By-laws of JPMorgan Chase as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as amended as set forth in Exhibit 1.4(b), shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.    

 1.5. Alternative Transaction Structures. The parties agree that JPMorgan Chase may change the method of effecting the business combination with Bank One, including, without limitation, by merging Bank One into a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1(a)) of JPMorgan Chase or by merging a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase into Bank One, and Bank One shall cooperate in such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective stockholders hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Subsidiary shall become a party to, and shall agree to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement and that any actions taken pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall not (i) alter or change the kind or amount of consideration to be issued to holders of Bank One Common Stock or the treatment of Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Other Bank One Equity Rights or Bank One Restricted Shares as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of the transaction to the holders of Bank One Common Stock, (iii) materially delay receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 6.1(c)), or (iv) otherwise cause any closing condition not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof).       ##### 

     

 3    

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES    

 2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Bank One Common Stock:    

 (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and JPMorgan Chase-Owned Stock, etc. All shares of Bank One Common Stock that are owned by Bank One as treasury stock and all shares of Bank One Common Stock that are owned by Bank One or JPMorgan Chase (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, trading account shares, trust shares and DPC shares, as each such term is defined in Section 3.1(b)) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of JPMorgan Chase or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock") that are owned by Bank One shall become treasury stock, except as otherwise provided in JPMorgan Chases Certificate of Incorporation.    

 (b) Conversion of Bank One Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of Bank One Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) shall be converted into 1.32 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. All such shares of Bank One Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock into which such Bank One Common Stock has been converted. Certificates previously representing shares of Bank One Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.    

 (c) JPMorgan Chase Capital Stock. Each share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and each share of JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of 6.63% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H, and Fixed/Adjustable Noncumulative Preferred Stock of JPMorgan Chase that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have properly perfected their right of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not remain outstanding, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, each share of such JPMorgan Chase Preferred Stock held by such stockholder shall remain outstanding in accordance with Section 2.1(c).       ##### 

     

 4    

 2.2. Exchange of Certificates.    

 (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by JPMorgan Chase and reasonably acceptable to Bank One (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Bank One Common Stock (collectively, the "Bank One Certificates"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at JPMorgan Chases option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively "certificates") representing the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for such shares of Bank One Common Stock. Such certificates for shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund".    

 (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of shares of Bank One Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares were converted into shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Bank One Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Bank One Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as JPMorgan Chase and Bank One may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Bank One Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Bank One Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Bank One Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Bank One Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all shares of Bank One Common Stock then held by such holder), and the Bank One Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Bank One Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Bank One, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Bank One Certificate representing such Bank One Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Bank One Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock into which the shares of Bank One Common Stock represented by such Bank One Certificate have been converted as provided in this Article II and the right to receive upon such surrender cash in lieu of any fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.2.    

 (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to JPMorgan Chase Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Bank One Certificate with respect to the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock represented thereby,       ##### 

     

 5   

and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until the holder of such Bank
One Certificate shall surrender such Bank One Certificate. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following the surrender of any such Bank One
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender the amount of
any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of JPMorgan Chase Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence) with respect to such whole shares of JPMorgan Chase
Common Stock, and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock.    

 (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Bank One Common Stock. All shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Bank One Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Bank One Common Stock;  _subject, however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Bank One on such shares of Bank One Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Bank One Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Bank One Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.    

 (e) No Fractional Shares(i) . No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Bank One Certificates evidencing Bank One Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Bank One Certificates, JPMorgan Chase shall pay each holder of Bank One Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Bank One Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on the Consolidated Tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a share of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.    

 (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Bank One for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any stockholders of Bank One who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for JPMorgan Chase Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to JPMorgan Chase Common Stock.       ##### 

     

 6    

 (g) No Liability. None of JPMorgan Chase, Bank One or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Bank One Common Stock for shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    

 (h) Withholding. JPMorgan Chase shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Bank One Common Stock or Dissenting Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by JPMorgan Chase, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Bank One Common Stock or Dissenting Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by JPMorgan Chase.    

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES    

 3.1. Representations and Warranties of Bank One. Except (x) with respect to any subsection of this Section 3.1, as set forth in the correspondingly identified subsection of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(iii)) or (y) as disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Bank One represents and warrants to JPMorgan Chase as follows:    

 (a) Organization, Standing and Power. Bank One is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), which has duly elected to become, and meets the applicable requirements for qualification as, a financial holding company pursuant to Section 4(l) of the BHC Act. Each of Bank One and its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a bank, corporation or partnership duly organized, validly existing and, in the case of banks or corporations, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Bank One, copies of which were previously furnished to JPMorgan Chase, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, (i) the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, (x) of which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting interests in such partnership), or (y) at least a majority of the securities or other interests of which that have by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or       ##### 

     

 7   

controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or
by such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "Significant
Subsidiary" means any Subsidiary of Bank One or JPMorgan Chase, as the case
may be, that would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of such party within
the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"); (iii) any reference to any event, change or effect
being "material" with respect to any entity means an event, change or effect
which is material in relation to the financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, businesses or results of operations of such entity and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and (iv) the term "material adverse effect"
means, with respect to any entity, a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities, businesses or results of
operations of such entity and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the
ability of such entity to perform its obligations hereunder or under any
Option Agreement on a timely basis; _provided_  that, in any such case
referred to in clause (iii) or (iv) the following shall not be deemed
"material" or to have a "material adverse effect": any change or event caused
by or resulting from (A) changes in prevailing interest rates, currency

Business Investment Act of 1958 ("SBIA") and the rules and regulations of the

 (d) SEC Documents; Regulatory Reports; Undisclosed Liabilities. (i) Bank One has filed all required reports, schedules, registration statements and other documents with the SEC since December 31, 2000 (the "Bank One SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such filing), the Bank One SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Bank One SEC Documents, and none of the Bank One SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of Bank One included in the Bank One SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and fairly       ##### 

     

 11   

present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Bank
One and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results
of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of such
companies as of the dates and for the periods shown.    

 (ii) Other than the Bank One SEC Documents, which are addressed in clause (i) above, Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31, 2000 with any Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One.    

 (iii) Except for (A) those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved for in the consolidated financial statements of Bank One included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003, as filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) liabilities incurred since September 30, 2003 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (C) liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One, Bank One and its Subsidiaries do not have, and since September 30, 2003 Bank One and its Subsidiaries have not incurred (except as permitted by Section 4.1), any liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be reflected in Bank Ones financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).    

 (e) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Bank One for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by Bank One with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by JPMorgan Chase for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.    

 (f) Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting Requirements. (i) Bank One and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are material to the operation of the businesses of Bank One and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Bank One Permits"), and Bank One and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Bank One Permits and all applicable laws and regulations, except where the failure so to hold or comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One. Except as       ##### 

     

 12   

disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of
this Agreement or as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, the
businesses of Bank One and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity
(including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001), except for possible violations which, individually or
in the aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
a material adverse effect on Bank One. To the knowledge of Bank One, no
investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to Bank One or any of
its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in each case, those
the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One.    

 (ii) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Bank One, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of Bank One or of any Bank One Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One, the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.    

 (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Bank One and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Bank One or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to the extent described in the Bank One SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, Bank One and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Bank One (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Bank One, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Bank One by others within those entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Bank Ones auditors and the audit committee of Bank Ones Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect Bank Ones ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Bank Ones auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Bank Ones internal controls. Bank One has made available to JPMorgan Chase a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Bank Ones auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002.       ##### 

     

 13    

 (g) Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of Bank One, threatened, against or affecting Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One as to which there is a significant possibility of an adverse outcome which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Bank One, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One having or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Bank One or on the Surviving Corporation.    

 (h) Taxes. Bank One and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any of them and have paid (or Bank One has paid on their behalf), or have set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the Bank One SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by Bank One and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "tax" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms "taxes" and "taxable") shall mean (i) all Federal, state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales, employment, use, property, withholding, excise, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts, (ii) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) as a result of being or having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (iii) liability for the payment of any amounts as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) or (ii). Neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.    

 (i) Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement and the Option Agreements, neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $10 million or more per annum, (ii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) which limits the ability of Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any person, or which requires referrals of business or requires Bank One or any of its affiliates to make available investment opportunities to any person on a priority, equal or exclusive basis, and in each case which limitation or requirement would reasonably be expected to be material to Bank One and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement), (v) in the case of a Bank One Benefit Plan, any of the benefits of which       ##### 

     

 14   

will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will
be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or the value of any of the benefits
of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or (vi) which would
prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Option Agreements. Bank One has previously made
available to JPMorgan Chase complete and accurate copies of each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 3.1(i) (collectively referred to herein as the "Bank One Contracts").
All of the Bank One Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except
to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or
if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Bank One. Neither Bank One nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the
best knowledge of Bank One, none of the other parties thereto have, violated
any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions of, any Bank One Contract, except
in each case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
effect on Bank One.    

 (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each employee benefit plan (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) and all stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and other material employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal, oral or written, legally binding or not (all the foregoing being herein called "Benefit Plans"), under which any employee or former employee of Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits, maintained or contributed to by Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries or under which Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (the "Bank One Benefit Plans"), Bank One has made available, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will make available, to JPMorgan Chase a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (B) such Bank One Benefit Plan, (C) each trust agreement relating to such Bank One Benefit Plan, (D) the most recent summary plan description for each Bank One Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Bank One Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to any Bank One Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.    

 (i) With respect to the Bank One Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Bank One, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which Bank One or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Bank One under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.    

 (ii) True and complete copies of the Bank One Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof have been, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will be, provided or made available to JPMorgan Chase.

15    

 (iv) Except as set forth in the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, no Bank One Benefit Plan or Bank One Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or former employee of Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any present or former employee of Bank One or any Subsidiary of Bank One as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G.    

 (k) Subsidiaries. Exhibit 21 to Bank Ones Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement includes all the Subsidiaries of Bank One which are Significant Subsidiaries. Each of Bank Ones Subsidiaries that is a bank (as defined in the BHC Act) (i) is listed in Section 3.1(k) of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule and (ii) is an "insured bank" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA") and applicable regulations thereunder. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k) of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, all of the shares of capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries held by Bank One or by another Bank One Subsidiary are fully paid and, except as provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 55, nonassessable and are owned by Bank One or a Subsidiary of Bank One free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance.    

 (l) Agreements with Regulators. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Bank One Disclosure Schedule, neither Bank One nor any Subsidiary of Bank One is a party to any written agreement, consent decree or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies or its management, nor has Bank One been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such agreement, decree, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, order, directive or similar submission, or any such policy, procedure or board resolutions.    

 (m) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Bank One SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or, in the case of actions taken after the date hereof, except as permitted by Section 4.1, since September 30, 2003 (i) Bank One and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with their past practices and (ii) there has not been any change, circumstance or event (including any event involving a prospective change) which has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Bank One.    

 (n) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Bank One, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly called and held (the "Bank One Board Approval"), has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Bank One and its stockholders and declared the Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Option Agreements and the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Bank One adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by Bank One stockholders at the Bank One      ##### 

  

16

Board Approval constitutes approval of this Agreement, the Bank One Stock
Option Agreement and the Merger (i) for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL
and (ii) by the "Disinterested Directors" of Bank One pursuant to clause
"First" of Subsection (b) of Article "Twelfth" of Bank Ones Certificate of
Incorporation, such that no additional stockholder approval (other than the
Required Bank One Vote (as defined in Section 3.1(o)) shall be required
pursuant to such Article to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreements. To the knowledge of
Bank One, except for Section 203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered
inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to this Agreement, the
Option Agreements, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.    

 (o) Vote Required.

 (ii) Except as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of JPMorgan Chase, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of JPMorgan Chase or of any JPMorgan Chase Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, and, except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

As and to the extent described in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. JPMorgan Chase (A) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to JPMorgan Chase, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of JPMorgan Chase by others      ##### 

  

24   

within those entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to JPMorgan Chases auditors and the
audit committee of JPMorgan Chases Board of Directors (1) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect in any material respect JPMorgan Chases ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for JPMorgan
Chases auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in JPMorgan Chases internal controls. JPMorgan
Chase has made available to Bank One a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to JPMorgan Chases auditors and audit committee since January 1,
2002.    

 (g) Legal Proceedings. Except as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding (whether judicial, arbitral, administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, threatened, against or affecting JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase as to which there is a significant possibility of an adverse outcome which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase or on the Surviving Corporation.    

 (h) Taxes. JPMorgan Chase and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns required to be filed by any of them and have paid (or JPMorgan Chase has paid on their behalf), or have set up an adequate reserve for the payment of, all taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for all taxes payable by JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. No material deficiencies or other claims for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for. Neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement or plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.    

 (i) Certain Agreements. Except as disclosed in or filed as exhibits to the JPMorgan Chase SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as disclosed in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement and the Option Agreements, neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (i) with respect to the employment of any directors or executive officers, or with any consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment of $10 million or more per annum, (ii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) which limits the ability of JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business, in any geographic area or with any person, or which requires referrals of business or requires JPMorgan Chase or any of its affiliates to make available investment opportunities to any person on a priority, equal or exclusive basis, and in each case which limitation or requirement would reasonably be      ##### 

  

25   

expected to be material to JPMorgan Chase and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, (iv) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective
bargaining agreement), (v) in the case of a JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, any
of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of
which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or the value of any
of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements, or (vi)
which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements. JPMorgan Chase has
previously made available to Bank One complete and accurate copies of each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 3.2(i) (collectively referred to herein as "JPMorgan Chase
Contracts"). All of the JPMorgan Chase Contracts are valid and in full force
and effect, except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance
with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and
effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase. Neither JPMorgan Chase nor
any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the best knowledge of JPMorgan Chase,
none of the other parties thereto have, violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or condition exists,
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a
default under the provisions of, any JPMorgan Chase Contract, except in each
case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
effect on JPMorgan Chase.    

 (j) Benefit Plans. (i) With respect to each Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries or under which JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries have any present or future liability (the "JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans"), JPMorgan Chase has made available, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will make available, to Bank One a true and correct copy of (A) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (B) such JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, (C) each trust agreement relating to such JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan, (D) the most recent summary plan description for each JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required by ERISA, (E) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (F) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to any JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.    

 (ii) With respect to the JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of JPMorgan Chase, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which JPMorgan Chase or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.    

 (iii) True and complete copies of the JPMorgan Chase Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof have been, or within 30 days after the execution hereof will be, provided or made available to Bank One.    

 (iv) Except as set forth in the JPMorgan Chase Disclosure Schedule, no JPMorgan Chase Benefit Plan or JPMorgan Chase Stock Plan exists that could result in the payment to any present or former employee of JPMorgan Chase or any Subsidiary of JPMorgan      ##### 

  

26   

Chase of any money or other property or accelerate or provide any other
rights or benefits to any present or former employee of JPMorgan Chase or any
Subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute

person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal

Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the
Board of Directors of such party reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law.    

 (ii) Each party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs such party or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence).

the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the
stockholders of JPMorgan Chase or Bank One, as the case may be, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms

Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "20% or more" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a
transaction involving JPMorgan Chase or Bank One, as the case may
be.     

 (f) Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(iii) shall be deemed to be a Change in Bank One Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.1(d)) or Change in JPMorgan Chase Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.1(e)), as the case may be, unless the Board of Directors of the party making such disclosure expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement.    

 5.5. Affiliates. Bank One shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) to deliver to JPMorgan Chase, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the Bank One Stockholders Meeting, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.5.

 (b) With respect to Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to outside the United States for the benefit of non-United States citizens or residents, the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph of this Section 5.7 shall apply to the extent the application of such principles does not violate applicable foreign law.    

 5.8. Bank One Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Bank One Common Stock (a "Bank One Stock Option") and each outstanding stock appreciation right (a "Bank One SAR") or restricted stock unit (a "Bank One Unit") or other equity-based award or right in respect of or based on the value of Bank One Common Stock (an "Other Bank One Equity Right") issued pursuant to any Bank One Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by JPMorgan Chase, and each share of Bank One Common Stock subject to restrictions that do not lapse upon the Effective Time (a "Bank One Restricted Share") shall be honored by JPMorgan Chase in accordance with their terms following their conversion in the Merger into restricted shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock. Each Bank One Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Bank One Stock Option, the same number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock as the holder of such Bank One Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share, at a price per share equal to (y) the exercise price per share of the shares of Bank One Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Bank One Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest cent; _provided, however,_ that in the case of any option to which section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth above unless use of such method will not preserve the status of such options as incentive stock options, in which case the manner of determination shall be adjusted in a manner that both complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and results in the smallest modification in the economic values that otherwise would be achieved by the holder pursuant to the method set forth above.    

 (b) Each holder of a Bank One SAR shall be entitled to that number of stock appreciation rights of JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan Chase SARs"), determined in the same manner as set forth above with respect to Bank One Stock Options assumed by JPMorgan Chase. Each holder of a Bank One Unit shall be entitled to that number of restricted stock units of JPMorgan Chase determined by multiplying the number of Bank One Units held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. Each Other Bank One Equity Right shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Bank One Common Stock and shall be converted into a right or award with respect to shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock determined in the same manner as set forth above with respect to Bank One Stock Options.    

 (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall deliver to the holders of Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Bank One Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares

or Other Bank One Equity Rights, as the case may be, shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 5.8 after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by JPMorgan
Chase as set forth above). If necessary, JPMorgan Chase shall comply with the
terms of the applicable Bank One Stock Plan and ensure, to the extent
required by, and subject to the provisions of, Section 5.8(a) and such Plan,
that Bank One Stock Options which qualified as incentive stock options prior
to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options of
JPMorgan Chase after the Effective Time.    

 (d) JPMorgan Chase shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights assumed by it in accordance with this Section 5.8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, JPMorgan Chase shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock subject to such Bank One equity awards and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Bank One equity awards remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, JPMorgan Chase shall administer the Bank One Stock Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 5.8 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the applicable Bank One Stock Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.    

 (e) Assuming that Bank One delivers to JPMorgan Chase the Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Bank One Insiders (as defined below) of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock in exchange for shares of Bank One Common Stock (including Bank One Restricted Shares), and of options or stock appreciation rights to purchase JPMorgan Chase Common Stock upon conversion of Bank One Stock Options and Bank One SARS or to receive shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock upon conversion of Bank One Units and Other Bank One Equity Rights, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by Bank One to JPMorgan Chase prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Bank One Insiders, the number of shares of Bank One Common Stock held by each such Bank One Insider and the number and description of the Bank One Stock Options, Bank One SARs, Bank One Units, Bank One Restricted Shares and Other Bank One Equity Rights held by each such Bank One Insider. "Bank One Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Bank One who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.

any directors, officers and employees of Bank One and its
Subsidiaries.    

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Bank One ( _provided_  that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by Bank One for such insurance ("Bank Ones Current Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of Bank Ones Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of Bank Ones Current Premium. In the event that JPMorgan Chase acts as its own insurer for its directors and officers generally with respect to matters typically covered by a directors and officers liability insurance policy, JPMorgan Chases obligations under this Section 5.11(b) may be satisfied by such self-insurance, so long as JPMorgan Chases senior debt ratings by Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investors Services, Inc. are no lower than such ratings as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.    

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.11.    

 (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.    

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and (ii)

are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.    

 5.12. Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One shall coordinate with the other the payment of dividends with respect to the JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Bank One Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and Bank One Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock and/or Bank One Common Stock or any shares of JPMorgan Chase Common Stock that any such holder receives in exchange for such shares of Bank One Common Stock in the Merger.    

 5.13. Public Announcements.

In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1 or as otherwise permitted under Section 4.4, no party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall provide the other party with its stockholder lists and allow and facilitate the other partys contact with its stockholders and prospective investors and following a Change in Bank One Recommendation or Change in JPMorgan Chase Recommendation, as the case may be, such contacts may be made without regard to the above limitations of this Section 5.13.    

 5.14. Commitments to the Community. (a) Following the Effective Time, the retail financial services business, which includes consumer banking, small businesses, middle market and consumer lending, will maintain a significant presence in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. The combined business will continue to use both the Bank One brand and the JPMorgan Chase brand while research is conducted to determine the best long-term branding strategy. Chicago will serve as the headquarters for the retail financial services business following the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the credit card business of the Surviving Corporation will be based in Wilmington, Delaware and will continue to use both the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase brands.    

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain its strong commitment to charitable giving in the greater Chicago metropolitan area and to increasing the annual level of charitable giving beyond the current levels of Bank One in that area.
