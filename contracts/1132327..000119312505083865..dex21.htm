-10-  Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by

ARTICLE 3



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 



Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_ _._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective stockholders:



(a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter
constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving Corporation capital
stock.



(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 3, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Buyer,
Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective wholly owned
Subsidiaries, which shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with
no payment being made with respect thereto and, subject to Section 3.1(d), any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ "), as
provided in Section 3.1(d)), together with the rights (the " _Company Rights_
") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of May 15, 2001, between
the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as rights agent, as amended
(together, the " _Company Rights Plan_ ") shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive  



 

-11-  an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Merger Consideration_ " shall mean
the quotient (to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing (i) the sum
of (u) $1,878,000,000 _plus_ (v) the aggregate exercise price of all Company
Options which both have an exercise price of less than the Merger
Consideration (excluding from the calculation of Merger Consideration this
clause (v) and clause (z) below for purposes of determining which Company
Options have an exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration) and
are outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, _minus_
(w) 50% of the excess (such amount not to exceed $2,500,000), if any, of the
Closing Transaction Liabilities over $19,400,000, _minus_ (x) the LJR
Dividend, if any, divided by (ii) the sum of (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Buyer, Merger Sub
or the Company or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries),  _plus_
(z) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
Company Options which both have an exercise price of less than the Merger
Consideration (excluding from the calculation of Merger Consideration clause
(v) above and this clause (z) for purposes of determining which Company
Options have an exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration) and
are outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section
3.1(b) (the " _Shares_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and automatically
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.



(c) Each share of Company capital stock held in the treasury of the Company
automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in
respect thereof.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by any Company Stockholder that is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262
(the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b), but, instead, such
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as
are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Appraisal
Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such Company Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect
or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Company Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262,
then the rights of such Company Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease,
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b) without interest. The Company
shall give notice to Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Buyer shall
have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the  



 

-12-  Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer and VAB
Acquisition Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. A portion of
the funds delivered to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) that are
not distributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Article 3 because the holders thereof properly exercised and perfected their
dissenters rights with respect thereto under the DGCL may be paid to the
holders of Appraisal Shares upon written instruction from Buyer to the Paying
Agent.



Section 3.2 _Surrender and Payment_. (a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior
to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, Buyer
shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company), a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for
the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with this Article 3 from time to
time after the Effective Time (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Promptly after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than the next Business Day after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (assuming no Appraisal Shares)
upon surrender of such Certificates (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed
by Buyer, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Buyer. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income resulting from
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the Company
Stockholders one year after the date of the mailing required by Section 3.2(b)
shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand by Buyer, and holders
of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with this Section 3.2
shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of any claim to the Merger
Consideration. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Authority, any such Merger Consideration, dividends
or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall and Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates held by such Company Stockholder shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as Buyer may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Buyer, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be paid in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, the proper amount of  



 

-13-  cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Buyer that the Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the Merger Consideration.



 

(c) _Stock Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3.



(d) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.



(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 in respect
of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Company Stockholders such amounts as it may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholders in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be.



Section 3.3 _Treatment of Stock Options_. (a) At the Effective Time, each
option to purchase a share of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ "),
granted under the Company stock option plans in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or otherwise, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become immediately vested, and shall  



 

-14-  be converted into the right to receive, from Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any
event, no later than 10 days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash
(less any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share
exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) Subject to Section 3.3(a), the Company shall take any actions reasonably
requested by Buyer to effectuate the vesting and termination of the
Company Options, it being understood that the intention of the parties is
that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Option or any
participant in any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement
of the Company shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock
(including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or VAB Acquisition Sub. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate
notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.



Section 3.4 _Determination of the Transaction Liabilities_. The Company shall
deliver to Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub, within two Business Days prior to
the Closing, a statement (the " _Transaction Liabilities Statement_ ") setting
forth its good faith estimate of (a) each unpaid Transaction Liability as of
the Closing Date, and (b) each Transaction Liability that has been paid prior
to the Closing Date (the Transaction Liabilities contemplated by clauses (a)
and (b), collectively, the " _Closing Transaction Liabilities_ "). The Company
shall (a) provide Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub with supporting documentation
evidencing the payment of each Transaction Liability listed on the
Transactions Liabilities Statement as being paid and (b) at Buyers request,
use reasonable best efforts to obtain certificates from any such service
providers verifying any outstanding amounts.

if the Company were Merger Sub thereunder) and, assuming termination or
expiration of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and receipt of the
Required Company Regulatory Approvals, the consummation of the Transactions do

Agreement or would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and other than such
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or
approvals which are required or become applicable due to the nature or status

respective Affiliates.

such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the Transactions,
including selling or agreeing to sell, holding or agreeing to hold separate,

prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

authorization by any Authority or the defense of any Action, to (i) sell, hold
separate, divest, discontinue, or limit, or proffer to, or agree to, sell,

limitation by Buyer or the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any of their respective assets
or businesses) or (ii) agree to any conditions or terms relating to or
applying to, or requiring any changes, limitations or restrictions on, the
operation of any asset or business, including the market practices and
structure of Buyer, that, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), is
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
adverse effect on the assets, business, long-term earning capacity or
financial condition of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the ECN Entities)
taken as a whole (any such requirement specified in clause (i) or (ii), a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ").

date hereof and prior to the Closing, and except as expressly permitted by
this Agreement or as may be agreed in writing by the Company, VAB Acquisition
Sub and Buyer, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action which would reasonably
be expected to materially impair Buyers ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or result in the failure to satisfy any condition to the
consummation of the Transactions.



 

Section 6.6 _Further Assurances_. The Company and Buyer agree, and Buyer,
after the Closing, agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation, to execute and
deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and

and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to
those provided to the Company Employees immediately before the Closing, other
than benefits under any bonus or other cash or equity compensation plan or
retirement benefits under any Reuters Plans;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer to continue to employ any
particular Company Employee following the Closing Date, and, with respect to
severance, Buyer shall cause to be provided Severance Benefits to Company
Employees who are terminated from their employment within six months after the
Closing Date at a level that is at least as favorable to such Company
Employees as applicable to such Company Employees on the day immediately

the annual cash incentive bonus allocated and approved for Company Employees
with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. The amount

Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") for the 2005 calendar year shall be
set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _2005
Bonus Plan_ ") in a payment grid and an aggregate bonus amount, which will be
adjusted to exclude any accrued or budgeted amounts for LJR (such aggregate
bonus amount the " _2005 Annual Bonus Amount_ "). In the event that the
Closing Date occurs in the 2006 calendar year, the annual cash incentive
bonuses for the Company Employees for the 2006 calendar year shall be
determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to approval by the Companys
Chief Executive Officer (the " _2006 Bonus Plan_ "), and shall in no event
exceed the 2005 Annual Bonus Amount (such aggregate bonus amount the " _2006
Annual Bonus Amount_ "). The Companys obligation with respect to the 2005
Annual Bonus Amount and the 2006 Annual Bonus Amount shall be accrued monthly,
in accordance with GAAP and past practice, with all amounts accrued on the
balance sheet of the Company, an ECN Entity or a VAB Subsidiary, as the case
may be, up to and including the Closing Date.



(iii) In the event that the Closing Date occurs during the 2005 calendar year,
an Eligible Company Employee shall be entitled to payment of his or her
portion of the 2005 Annual Bonus Amount upon the earlier of (x) February 15,
2006 and (y) within 10 business days of his or her termination of employment
from the Company, ECN Entity or VAB Subsidiary, as the case may be. For
purposes of this paragraph, " _Eligible Company Employee_ " means an
individual (x) who is a Company Employee, including an employee of a VAB
Subsidiary (a " _VAB Employee_ ") on February 15, 2006 or whose employment
has been terminated following the Closing Date but prior to February 15, 2006
under circumstances which would render such Company Employee eligible for
severance under the Instinet Corporation Severance Policy if such Policy were
in place and applicable to such Employee at such time (it being agreed that a
transfer of a Company Employee or VAB Employee in connection with the VAB
Purchase shall not be deemed a termination); and (y) who is eligible to
receive a payment under the 2005 Bonus Plan. Such Eligible Company Employee
shall be paid an amount of bonus for the 2005 calendar year, in the discretion
of the Compensation Committee, equal to either (i) a minimum of 70% of his or
her allocable portion of the 2005 Annual Bonus Amount determined in the same
manner and in a similar percentage as the Companys 2004 annual bonus was paid
to each such Company Employee, or (ii) such greater amount as determined in
the discretion of the Compensation Committee, which amount shall be prorated
for the period beginning January 1, 2005 and ending on the Closing Date, but
limited for any terminated Eligible Company Employee by taking into account
the partial year accrual for such Employee whose employment is
terminated prior to December 31, 2005 provided that in no event shall the
Company and VAB Acquisition Sub in the aggregate be required to pay more than
the 2005 Annual Bonus Amount. The Compensation Committee shall determine the
amounts of bonuses payable to Eligible Company Employees pursuant to the
previous sentence prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Company
Employees to participate in any cash incentive bonus plans determined by Buyer
in its discretion for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2005, it being understood that such plans provide for
discretionary bonuses.



(iv) In the event that the Closing Date occurs during the 2006 calendar year,
an Eligible Company Employee shall be entitled to payment of his or
her portion of the 2006  



 

-39-  Annual Bonus Amount upon the earlier of (x) February 15, 2007 and (y) within
10 business days of his or her termination of employment from the Company,
ECN Entity or VAB Subsidiary, as the case may be. For purposes of this
paragraph, " _Eligible Company Employee_ " means an individual (x) who is a
Company Employee (including a VAB Employee) on February 15, 2007 or whose
employment has been terminated following the Closing Date and prior to
February 15, 2007 under circumstances which would render such Company Employee
or VAB Employee eligible for severance under the Instinet Corporation
Severance Policy if such Policy were in place and applicable to such Employee
at such time (it being agreed that a transfer of a Company Employee in
connection with the VAB Purchase shall not be deemed a termination); and (y)
who is eligible to receive a payment under the 2006 Bonus Plan determined by
the Compensation Committee and approved by the Companys Chief Executive
Officer. Such Eligible Company Employee shall be paid an amount of bonus for
the 2006 year, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, equal to
either (i) 70% of his or her allocable portion of the 2006 Annual Bonus
Amount determined in the same manner and in the same percentage as the
Companys 2005 annual bonus was paid to each such Company Employee, or (ii)
such greater amount of bonus as determined in the discretion of the
Compensation Committee, which amount shall be prorated for the period
beginning January 1, 2006 and ending on the Closing Date, but limited for any
terminated Eligible Company Employee by taking into account the partial
year accrual for such Employee whose employment is terminated prior to
December 31, 2006 provided that in no event shall the Company and VAB
Acquisition Sub in the aggregate be required to pay more than the 2006 Annual
Bonus Amount. Buyer shall permit Company Employees to participate in any cash
incentive bonus plans determined by Buyer in its discretion for the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2005, it being
understood that such plans provide for discretionary bonuses.



(v) With respect to each Company Employee who receives revenue-based
commissions as a portion of his or her compensation (" _Commission Employees_
"), such revenue-based commissions shall be accrued through the Closing Date
and paid when such commissions are generally paid to such Commission Employee
(i) pursuant to the relevant commission agreements, (ii) assuming 100%
achievement of all relevant targets in order to receive the full amount of
such commission for the period through the Effective Time and (iii) at a rate
that approximates such Commission Employees commission as a percent of
revenue attributed to such Commission Employee in the most recent commission
cycle (the " _Accrued Commissions_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any Commission Employee who is terminated by Buyer after the Closing Date in
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs shall receive a pro-rata
commission based on the percentage of the 2005 year, or the 2006 year (as the
case may be) that such Commission Employee was employed prior to such
termination. Commissions paid to Commission Employees after the Closing Date
will be under commission arrangements established by Buyer, if any.



(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, and without limiting the obligations
of Buyer in Section 6.7(a) hereof, the Company Employees shall generally be
eligible to participate in each of the pension, welfare and/or fringe benefit
plans, funds, programs and/or arrangements, including severance, stock option
and incentive compensation plans, being provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer (collectively, the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "), as
determined by Buyer in good faith. Except for purposes of accruing benefits
under any defined benefit pension plans, on and after the Closing Date,
Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer Benefit  



 

-40-  Plans in accordance with their terms and, for purposes of eligibility for
participation, vesting, and accrual of benefits within Buyer Benefit Plans,
Company Employees shall receive credit for all of their service with the
Company (and services with each of their predecessors or Affiliates, if
applicable) to the same extent such service was recognized under the
corresponding or similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. For
purposes of any Buyer Benefit Plan which is the type of benefits described in
Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) (" _Welfare Benefits_
"), a Company Employee (and his or her dependents, if applicable) shall be
immediately eligible to participate as of the Closing Date without regard to
any otherwise applicable waiting period, and without any exclusion from
coverage for any preexisting condition, to the extent such employee and his or
her dependents were eligible for participation in a comparable Company Benefit
Plan, subject only to the approval of the applicable insurance provider, if
any, which Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain. In addition,
Buyer shall (i) waive all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively at
work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any Buyer Benefit Plan to the
extent waived or satisfied by a Company Employee or dependent under any
comparable Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) take into
account and provide credit for any covered expenses incurred on or before the
Closing Date by any Company Employee or dependent thereof for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductibles, coinsurance, maximum out of pocket, and
similar provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable Buyer Benefit
Plan.



(c) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall either cause the Company to
become a participating employer in the Buyers 401(k) Plan (the " _New Savings
Plan_ "), or to continue the applicable Company 401(k) savings plan for the
benefit of Company Employees. The New Savings Plan shall accept direct
rollovers from any applicable Company 401(k) plan of eligible rollover
distributions (including outstanding loan balances) payable for the benefit of
Company Employees who are employed by the Company as of the Closing Date and
will provide for participant loans on substantially the same basis as provided
in the applicable Company 401(k) plans. With respect to the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall make a matching contribution for the
benefit of the Company Employees under the New Savings Plan or the Company
401(k) savings plan (as the case may be) in the amount accrued on the balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date for the Companys matching
contribution to the Company 401(k) plan with respect to the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs (provided that the percentage of the Company
Employees contribution matched by the Company is consistent with the past
practice of the Company).



(d) Buyer expressly agrees to assume, be bound by, honor and perform all
of the Companys or their Affiliates obligations under each of the
Employment Agreements, and each such Employment Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect following the Closing.



(e) Upon the Closing Date, each participant in the Instinet 2004
Performance Share Plan (the " _Performance Plan_ ") shall receive (x) the
payout for any Plan Cycles (as defined under the Performance Plan) which have
ended prior to the Closing Date (if any), and (y) with respect to Plan Cycles
which have not been completed as of the Closing Date, a pro rata payout for
each partial Plan Cycle, equal to the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of months which have elapsed in the Plan Cycle prior to
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of months
in the Plan Cycle, and (ii) the payout such  



 

-41-  participant would have received with respect to such Plan Cycle if the
Target Performance Goal (as defined under the Performance Plan) was attained
with respect to each Performance Measure (as defined under the Performance
Plan), as determined by the Committee under the Performance Plan prior to the
Closing Date.



(f) Buyer shall cause VAB Acquisition Sub to comply with the terms of this
Section 6.7 and honor the obligations of Buyer with respect to VAB Employees,
from and after the closing of the VAB Purchase.



(g) Buyer and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date to effectuate the transactions
contemplated in this Section 6.7 and provide for a smooth transition,
including the provision of all notices required by Applicable Law (if any).



Section 6.8 _No Additional Representations_. Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub
acknowledge that each of them and their representatives have received access
to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets
of the Company which each of them and their representatives have deemed
necessary or requested to review, and that each of them and their
representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and the Company to discuss the businesses and assets of the Company.
Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4 (which
includes the Schedules thereto) and any closing certificate delivered by the
Company, Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub acknowledge that neither the Company
nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, including, without limitation, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding the Company or any of its businesses furnished or
made available to Buyer or VAB Acquisition Sub.



Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. (a) Any
indemnification provisions of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
(excluding LJR) certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who at the Closing were directors, officers or employees of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ ") pending or
asserted within such period shall continue until the disposition or resolution
of such Action. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 6.9, without limit as
to time, except as with respect to the directors, officers or employees of
the VAB Subsidiaries in their capacity as such.



(b) Each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, shall, to the fullest extent
(i) permitted under Applicable Laws and (ii) provided in the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each
of the foregoing) each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee
or  



 

-42-  fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with
such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Person_
") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action), arising out
of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred before the Closing (including acts or omissions in
connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other
fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company) or the Transactions. In the event of any such Action, Buyer
and the Company shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of
any such Action.



(c) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained for the benefit of the Company (provided that
Buyer may substitute therefor third-party policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are in other
respects not materially less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons, and
which coverage and amounts shall be no less than the coverage and amounts
provided at that time for Buyers directors and officers) with respect to
matters arising on or before the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the amount of
which premium is set forth in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.



(d) In the event Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.9. The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall
survive the consummation of the Transactions and expressly are intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons. Buyer shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this Section 6.9.



Section 6.10 _Company Stockholders Meeting_ _._ (a) As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, in
accordance with Applicable Laws and the Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company Certificate_ ") and the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") to consider and vote upon
approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ "). The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
by the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are
solicited, in material compliance with Applicable Laws, other than such non-
compliance resulting from the failure of the representation set forth in
Section 5.9 to be true and correct.



 

-43- (b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), that meets in all material
respects the requirements of Applicable Laws, to seek the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger. The Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and any preliminary version thereof filed by it and shall cause such
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The
Company shall notify Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub as promptly as reasonably
practicable of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and shall provide to Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub copies of
any written comments received from the SEC in connection with the Proxy
Statement. Each of Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub shall be provided an
opportunity to review and comment on all filings with the SEC, including the
Proxy Statement, and all mailings to the Company Stockholders in connection
with the Merger, and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to all
comments proposed by Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub. Buyer shall promptly
provide any information or responses to comments or other assistance
reasonably requested by the Company or the SEC in connection with the
foregoing. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the Company, Buyer, VAB Acquisition Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Buyer which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. Subject to the following sentence, the Company Board
Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement, and the Company Board
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of this
Agreement by the Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may make a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.11(c) and, in each such
event, shall not be required to call, give notice of, convene or hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting.



Section 6.11  _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) From the date hereof until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 8, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it permit any director, officer or key
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of its agents or
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or Company Affiliate) to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or
recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
relating to any  



 

-44-  Acquisition Proposal or make or authorize any statement, propose publicly or
agree to do any of the foregoing relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 



(b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board
from complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2
of the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ , any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Change in the Company Board Recommendation unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other
than with respect to disclosure which expresses no view of the Acquisition
Proposal other than that it is pending further consideration by the Company).



(c) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or any
officer, director, key employee or agent or representative of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary acting on behalf of or at the direction of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or the Company Board from at any time prior to, but
not after, the time this Agreement is adopted by the Company Stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) providing information in response to a
request therefor by, or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, a
Person who has made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal if the
Company Board receives from such Person an executed customary confidentiality
agreement no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (other than with respect to the
standstill provisions, which shall not be required), (ii) entering into a
Company Acquisition Agreement and terminate this Agreement, and (iii)
effecting a Change in the Company Board Recommendation, if and only to the
extent that, (1) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above,
(A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors to
comply with their respective fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (B)
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of Section 6.11(a);
(2) in the case of clause (i) above, the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisors that it is reasonably likely that such Acquisition
Proposal would result in a Superior Proposal; and (3) in the case of clause
(ii) or (iii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall send written notice of its intention to take the
action referred to in clause (ii) above to Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub, at
least three Business Days prior to the taking of such action by the Company,
advising Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub that the Company Board is prepared to
conclude that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
during such three business day period the Company and its advisors shall have
negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal and the Company Board fully considers
any such adjustment and nonetheless concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.



(d) Except as permitted by Section 6.10 or this Section 6.11, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer, the approval of the Agreement and the Merger or the Company
Board Recommendation or take any action or make  



 

-45-  any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting
inconsistent with such approval or Company Board Recommendation (collectively,
a " _Change in the Company Board Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Board
Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or publicly
stated proposal to approve or recommend) by the Company Board of an
Acquisition Proposal, or any failure by the Company Board to recommend against
an Acquisition Proposal after the Company Board and its advisors have fully
considered such proposal.



(e) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than the parties hereto) conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will use its reasonable
best efforts to inform as promptly as reasonably practicable the officers,
directors, key employees and representatives of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.11.



(f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub of
any request for information or any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such Person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. The Company shall
keep Buyer and VAB Acquisition Sub informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the status
and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer
has been withdrawn or rejected.



(g) For purposes of this Agreement:



(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person
(other than the Transactions) with respect to (A) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Company Subsidiary (excluding LJR) whose business constitutes 25% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
(excluding LJR), taken as a whole), (B) any direct or indirect purchase of an
equity interest (including by means of a tender or exchange offer)
representing an amount equal to or greater than a 25% voting or economic
interest in the Company, or (C) any direct or indirect purchase of assets,
securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater
than 25% of the consolidated assets, net income or net revenues of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (excluding LJR) taken as a whole
(including stock of the Company Subsidiaries (excluding LJR)).



(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except that references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "25%"
shall be replaced by "100%") made by a Person other than a party hereto  



 

-46-  that is on terms that the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside counsel) in good faith concludes, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal (A) would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, including, to the extent required, financing
which is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such Person.



Section 6.12 _Rights Agreement_. Except as expressly required by this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior consent of each of Buyer
and VAB Acquisition Sub, amend the Rights Agreement or take any other action
with respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement,

Acquisition Proposal.



Section 6.13 _LJR Sale; VAB Purchase_. (a) The parties acknowledge that none
of the provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to Sections

Sale, except the provisions of this Section 6.13.



(b) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Buyer and VAB
Acquisition Sub (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), agree to any modification of any term or condition of, or give
any consent or waiver or exercise any right of termination under, the LJR Sale
Agreement, which modification, consent, waiver or exercise would be reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any respect the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Transactions, including the timing thereof. The Company
shall comply with the terms of the LJR Sale Agreement in all material
respects. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions to the consummation of the LJR Sale to be satisfied as of the
earliest practicable date and to consummate the LJR Sale in accordance with
the terms of the LJR Sale Agreement. The Company will comply in all material
respects with its obligations under the guaranty side letter with Reuters
America LLC.



(c) Buyer will not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree to
any modification of any term or condition of, or give any consent or waiver
or exercise any right of termination under, the VAB Transaction Agreement,
which modification, consent, waiver or exercise would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any respect the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (prior to the Closing) or the Transactions, including the timing
thereof. Buyer shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the other
parties to the VAB Transaction Agreement to, comply with the terms of the VAB
Transaction Agreement in all material respects. Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the conditions to the consummation of the VAB Purchase

period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company
shall not  



 

-47-  terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any Company Subsidiary is a party and
which was entered into in connection with the sale process undertaken by the
Company. Pursuant to the terms of any such confidentiality agreement, and
other than with respect to the purchaser pursuant to the LJR Sale Agreement,
the Company shall promptly request that each Person which has heretofore
executed such a confidentiality agreement with the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their representatives with respect to such
Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to promptly return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company or
any of its Affiliates or any of its or their representatives to such Person or
any of its Affiliates or any of its or their representatives. 



Section 6.15 _Financial Cooperation_. The Company shall cooperate with Buyer,
and shall, at Buyers expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its independent auditors to so cooperate, in the preparation and filing of
Buyer pro forma financial statements and related information and historical
financial statements of the Company or the ECN Entities as (a) reasonably
requested for Buyers filings under the Exchange Act and (b) as reasonably

GENERAL PROVISIONS

any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such Action in such court or that any such Action
which is brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in this Section 9.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Buyer or one or
more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Buyer (each, an "

relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement and (2) to
the extent required by Section 251 of the DGCL in order for this Agreement,

inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.



Section 9.5 _No Waiver_. No waiver by either party hereto of any breach of
any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty hereunder shall be deemed
a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same. The exercise of
any right granted to either party herein shall not operate as a waiver of any
default or breach on the part of the other party hereto.  



 

-53-  Each and all of the several rights and remedies of either party hereto under
this Agreement shall be construed as cumulative and no one right as exclusive
of the others.



Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, including the
exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous written or oral agreements between them or any of their

the other, make any disclosures required to comply with Applicable Laws,
except such consent shall be sought where practicable to do so. The parties
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form agreed to by
the parties and VAB Acquisition Sub.



Section 9.10 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless a contrary
intention appears, (a) the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section, Schedule, Exhibit or other subdivision, (b)
whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," (c) reference to any Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit is
reference to such Article or Section of, or Schedule or Exhibit to, this
Agreement, (d) "days" means calendar days, (e) all defined terms in this
Agreement have the defined meaning when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant to this  



 

-55-  Agreement, unless otherwise indicated therein, (f) all defined terms in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term, and in each case, vice versa, (g) references in this Agreement
to specific laws (such as the Code, HSR Act and ERISA) or to specific
provisions of laws include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (h) any statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
statutes. No provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed
against any party hereto solely because such party or its legal representative
drafted such provision.



Section 9.11 _Expenses_. Except as specifically provided in Section 8.6, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expenses, except
filing fees incurred in connection with SEC filings relating to the
Transactions and printing and mailing costs related thereto, all of which
shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Company.



Section 9.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided
herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto

6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.15, 9.6, 9.7, 9.9, this Section 9.12 and Section
9.15, VAB Acquisition Sub) and their successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing herein express or implied is intended to, or shall be construed to,
provide or create any legal or equitable rights or benefits to any Person
other than the parties hereto and VAB Acquisition Sub; _provided_ , _however_
, that, upon termination of the VAB Transaction Agreement, VAB Acquisition
Sub shall no longer have any third party beneficiary rights under this

to the benefit of Buyer.



Section 9.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held or
deemed to be or is, in fact, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any
particular case because it conflicts with any other provision or provisions
hereof or any constitution or statute or rule of public policy, or for any
other reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the
provision in question inoperative or unenforceable.



Section 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



Section 9.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedy at law or equity, each party and, with respect to the
Sections of this Agreement specified in Section 9.12, VAB Acquisition Sub
(subject to the proviso in Section 9.12), shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this
Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.
In the event that any Action should be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.



 

-56- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of
the day and year first above written.
