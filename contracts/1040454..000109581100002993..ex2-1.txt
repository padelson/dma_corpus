of WPT and a related certificate in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit A

Incorporation, WPT shall succeed automatically to all of the rights and
property of the Company and shall be subject to all of the Company\'s
debts and liabilities in the same manner as if WPT had incurred them. The
Company Board shall constitute the initial Board of Directors of WPT As a
result of the Incorporation, each outstanding Company Common Share shall
become, without any additional action of any shareholder of the Company, one
fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock of WPT ("WPT Common
Stock").   SECTION 2.2 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the CGCL and the MGCL, at
the Effective Time, WPT shall be merged with and into Pan Pacific. Following

Francisco time, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth
Business Day, after the last of all of the conditions to the respective
obligations of the Parties set forth in Article VII hereof shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions) or (b) at such other time and date as Pan Pacific and
the Company shall mutually agree; provided, however, if the Closing would
otherwise occur on or before November 15, 2000, the Closing shall be
postponed in accordance with Section 5.4 (such date and time on and at which
the Closing occurs being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The
Closing shall take place at the offices of O\'Melveny and Myers LLP, San
Francisco, California. At the Closing, the documents, certificates, opinions
and instruments referred to in Article VII shall be executed and delivered to
the applicable party.     13  19  SECTION 2.4 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practical on or after
the Closing Date, the Parties shall (i) file with the State Department of

form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the MGCL; (ii) file with the Secretary of State of the State of
California an agreement of merger or other appropriate documents (the
"Agreement of Merger") in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the CGCL; and (iii) make all

CGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at 2:00

the Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record of such Articles of
Merger by, the Maryland Department in accordance with the MGCL and (ii) the
filing of the Agreement of Merger with, and acceptance for record of such
Agreement of Merger by, the California Secretary of State in accordance with
the CGCL, or at such other time as the Parties shall agree as specified in
such filings in accordance with applicable law (the "Effective Time").  
SECTION 2.5 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 3-114 of the MGCL, Section 1107 of the CGCL and
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time of the Merger, all of the property,
rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Pan Pacific will vest in the
Surviving Company, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Pan Pacific will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.   SECTION 2.6 CHARTER; BYLAWS. At the Effective Time and
without any further action on the part of the Company or Pan Pacific, (i) the
charter of Pan Pacific as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
charter of the Surviving Company until duly amended as provided for therein
or under the MGCL and (ii) the bylaws of Pan Pacific as in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until duly
amended as provided for therein or under the MGCL.   SECTION 2.7 DIRECTORS;
OFFICERS. The directors of the Surviving Company following the Effective Time
shall be (a) the five directors of Pan Pacific immediately prior to the
Merger plus (b) two additional individuals chosen by Pan Pacific in
accordance with Section 6.17. The officers of the Surviving Company
immediately following the Effective Time shall be the officers of Pan Pacific
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such directors and officers shall
serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal from office
in accordance with the Surviving Company\'s charter or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed (in the case of officers)
and qualified, as the case may be.   SECTION 2.8 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Pan Pacific, the Company or the holder of any of the following
securities:     14  20  (a) Subject to Section 2.10, each share of WPT
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than dissenting shares referred to in Section 2.8(e) and shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.8(b) hereof), shall be converted into
and represent the right to receive 0.62 fully paid and nonassessable shares
(rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) (as adjusted as set forth
in subsection (d), the "Exchange Ratio") of Pan Pacific Common Stock (the
"Merger Consideration"). The Merger Consideration shall be payable upon the
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such WPT Common Stock. As
of the Effective Time, all WPT Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate representing any WPT Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the
Merger Consideration, (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Pan
Pacific Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.10, (iii) any
dividends or distributions in accordance with Section 2.11(f) and (iv) any
unpaid dividend declared by the Company in respect of Company Common Shares
in accordance with Section 5.3 or 5.4, in each case without interest.   (b)
Each share of WPT Common Stock that is (i) held in the treasury of WPT or
owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of WPT or (ii) owned by Pan Pacific or
any Subsidiary of Pan Pacific, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution of any consideration shall
be made with respect thereto.   (c) Each share of common stock, preferred
stock or other stock of Pan Pacific issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall be unchanged after
the Merger.   (d) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Pan Pacific Common
Stock, WPT Common Stock or Company Common Shares, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Pan
Pacific Common Stock, WPT Common Stock or Company Common Shares occurring
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of WPT
Common Stock which are dissenting shares (as defined in Section 1300(b) of
the CGCL), if any, shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive any shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock, but the holders thereof shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the CGCL. Each holder
of dissenting shares who becomes entitled to payment therefor pursuant to the
CGCL shall receive payment from the Surviving Company in accordance with the
CGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any such holder of dissenting shares
shall have failed to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the CGCL, (ii) if any such holder of dissenting     15 
21 shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal thereof
or lost his right to appraisal and payment therefor under the CGCL or (iii)
if neither any holder of dissenting shares nor the Surviving Company shall
have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all
dissenting shares within the time provided in the CGCL, such holder or
holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock and such shares of WPT Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and represent the right to receive shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock,
without interest thereon, as provided in Section 2.8(a).   SECTION 2.9
TREATMENT OF COMPANY OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK.   (a) At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option, the same number of shares of Pan
Pacific Common Stock as the holder of such Company Option would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such
option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the Company Common Shares
purchasable pursuant to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (y) the number of full shares of Pan Pacific Common
Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Company Option in accordance with
the foregoing. It is intended that Company Options converted into options to
acquire Pan Pacific Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing
shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Options
qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and the provisions of this Section 2.9 shall be applied consistent with such
intent.   (b) Pan Pacific shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Pan Pacific Common
Stock for delivery under Company Stock Plans assumed in accordance with this
Section 2.9. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Pan Pacific
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of
Pan Pacific Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.   (c) The Company Board shall, prior to or as of the
Effective Time, take all necessary actions, if any, pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and the instruments
evidencing the Company Options, to provide for the conversion of the Company
Options into options to acquire Pan Pacific Common Stock in accordance with
this Section 2.9 without the consent of the holders of the Company
Options.   (d) At the Effective Time, the vesting of each
restricted Company Common Share granted under any Company Stock Plan and set
forth on Section 3.3(b) of the Company     16  22 Disclosure Schedule
shall be fully accelerated and the contractual restrictions thereon shall
terminate.   SECTION 2.10 FRACTIONAL INTERESTS. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, and such fractional interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Pan Pacific. In
lieu of any such fractional interests, each shareholder of WPT exchanging
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.8(a) who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Pan Pacific Common Stock (after
taking into account all shares of WPT Common Stock then held of record by
such shareholder) shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the last reported sales
prices of Pan Pacific Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE, on each of the
ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.  
SECTION 2.11 SURRENDER OF WPT COMMON STOCK AND COMPANY COMMON SHARES; STOCK
TRANSFER BOOKS.   (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Pan Pacific shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the shareholders of WPT in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange
Agent"). The Exchange Agent shall receive the Merger Consideration to which
shareholders of WPT shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(a). Prior
to the Effective Time, Pan Pacific will make available to the Exchange Agent
sufficient shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock and an estimated amount of cash
in lieu of fractional shares (such shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.11(e), if any, and cash in lieu of fractional shares being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to make all exchanges
pursuant to Section 2.11(b). The Exchange Agent shall cause the shares of Pan
Pacific Common Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and
cash in lieu of fractional shares deposited by Pan Pacific to be (i) held for
the benefit of the shareholders of WPT and (ii) promptly applied to making
the exchanges and payments provided for in Section 2.11(b). Such shares of
Pan Pacific Common Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and
cash in lieu of fractional shares shall not be used for any purpose that is
not provided for herein.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each
shareholder of WPT whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)
into the right to receive certificates representing Pan Pacific Common Stock
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and the cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.10. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of     17  23 such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares
of Pan Pacific Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.8(a), with respect to Certificates
formerly representing shares of WPT Common Stock, (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.10, after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings, and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.11(e), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each
Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of WPT Common Stock it
theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a),
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10 and any
dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.11(e). If the exchange of
certificates representing shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the exchange of certificates
representing shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.   (c) At any time after the one-year anniversary of
the Effective Time, Pan Pacific shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to Pan Pacific cash and any other instruments (including
shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock) in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which had been made available to
the Exchange Agent and which have not been distributed to holders of
Certificates. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate, representing shares
converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a), may surrender such Certificate to the
Surviving Company and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the consideration payable in
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section 2.10 and Section 2.11(e),
without interest, but shall have no greater rights against the Surviving
Company than may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Company
under applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Pan Pacific, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of
WPT (or Company Shareholder) for shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock (and any
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock)
whose Certificates have been delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (d) At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of WPT shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
WPT Common Stock on the records of WPT From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of WPT Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of WPT Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable law.     18  24  (e) No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Pan Pacific Common
Stock the holder is entitled to receive and no Merger Consideration, or any
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10, shall be paid to
such holder until the holder of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such surrender, Pan
Pacific shall cause to be paid to the Person in whose name the certificates
representing the Pan Pacific Common Stock shall be issued in respect of such
surrendered Certificate, any dividends or distributions with respect to such
shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock which have a record date after the
Effective Time and shall have become payable between the Effective Time and
the time of such surrender. In no event shall the Person entitled to receive
such dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest thereon.  
SECTION 2.12 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock), and dividends or
distributions, if any, as may be required to be issued pursuant to Section
2.8(a), Section 2.10 and Section 2.11(e); provided, however, that Pan Pacific
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Pan Pacific or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   SECTION
2.13 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Pan Pacific or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or any Option
Consideration, or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or dividends or
distributions, if any, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any shareholder of WPT or holder of Company Options such amounts as Pan
Pacific or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Pan
Pacific or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the shareholder of WPT or
holder of any Company Options, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Pan Pacific or the Exchange Agent.   ARTICLE III. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and
warrants to Pan Pacific that the statements contained in this Article III are
true and correct except as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Pan Pacific on or before the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") or as otherwise limited
herein.     19  25  SECTION 3.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with
the real estate investment trust, corporate, partnership or other applicable
power and authority to own and operate its business as presently conducted.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other entity to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its properties or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such
failures of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to be so qualified as
would not, when taken together with all such other failures, cause a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has previously made available to Pan
Pacific true and correct copies of its Organizational Documents as in effect
on the date hereof. The Company is a "real estate investment trust," as such
term is defined in Section 23000 of the CGCL.   SECTION 3.2 AUTHORIZATION;
VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENT. The Company has the requisite real estate
investment trust and corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby subject to the adoption and approval of the
Agreement and the Incorporation by the requisite vote of the holders of
Company Common Shares (such votes being the "Company Voting Proposals"). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the
Company Board and all other necessary real estate investment trust and
corporate action on the part of the Company, other than the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Incorporation by the requisite vote of the
holders of the Company Common Shares, and no other trust or corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the Company Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights generally and
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law).   SECTION 3.3 CAPITALIZATION.   (a) As of the date hereof and as
of the date of the Effective Time (immediately prior to the Incorporation),
the authorized shares of beneficial interest in the Company consists of an
unlimited number of Company Common Shares and 2,000,000 preferred shares of

30, 2000, (i) 17,297,250 Company Common Shares were issued and outstanding,
of which zero (0) shares were held in the Company treasury, and (ii) no
Company Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding. Since June 30, 2000, no
Company Shares have been issued or reserved for issuance, except for Company
Shares issued in respect of the     20  26 exercise, conversion or
exchange of Company Stock Rights or Company DownREIT Units outstanding on
June 30, 2000.   (b) Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth as of the date hereof, for each Company Stock Plan, the dates on
which Company Stock Rights under such plan were granted, the number of
outstanding Company Stock Rights granted on each such date, the number and
class of Company Shares for or into which each such Company Stock Right is
exercisable, convertible or exchangeable and the exercise price thereof.
Except as set forth in this Section 3.3(b), or described in Section 3.3(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or the rights to convert Company DownREIT
Units into Company Common Shares pursuant to the Company DownREIT Partnership
Agreements, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is
bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional Company Shares or
any other equity interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or
its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security,
option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking and neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have granted any
share appreciation rights or any other contractual rights the value of which
is derived from the financial performance of the Company or the value of
Company Shares or any other equity interests of the Company.   (c) There
are no outstanding or contingent obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Shares or
any other equity interests in the Company or the capital stock or ownership
interests of any Subsidiary of the Company, other than the Company\'s
obligation to convert Company DownREIT Units pursuant to the Company DownREIT
Partnership Agreements.   (d) All Company Common Shares subject to issuance
as specified in Section 3.3(b) hereof or in Section 3.3(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, are duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
including payment of any exercise price in respect thereof, will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.   (e) There are no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having voting rights (or convertible into
securities having such rights) ("Voting Debt") of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries issued and outstanding. There are no voting trusts, proxies or
other voting agreements with respect to the equity interests in the Company
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. The Company does
not have a shareholder rights plan in effect.   SECTION 3.4 SUBSIDIARIES.
The only Subsidiaries of the Company are those set forth in Section 3.4 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock (including shares which may be issued upon exercise of outstanding
options) or     21  27 other ownership interests of each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure

consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of income, shareholders\' equity and cash flows of the Company

Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no Action (i) instituted, (ii) pending

individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, has a Company
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any outstanding judgment, decree or
injunction, in each case against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Assets or any statute, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which,

Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have (i) duly filed (or there have been filed on their behalf)

true, correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) duly paid in full,
or made provision in accordance with GAAP (or there has been paid or
provision has been made on their behalf) for, all Taxes required to have been
paid by them, whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns and (iii)

in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent

Subsidiaries has received a written notice of any threatened audits with
respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1992, with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
With     25  31 respect to taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 1992, neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority (whether domestic or
foreign) has asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any
deficiency or claim for Taxes;   (d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth each year for which an extension to file Tax
Returns has been requested and for which such Tax Returns have not yet been
filed;   (e) There are no liens for Taxes upon any Assets of the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof, except for liens for Taxes not yet due and payable,
and no written power of attorney that has been granted by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than to the Company or a Subsidiary, property tax
consultants or KPMG LLP) currently is in force with respect to any
matter relating to Taxes;   (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(f) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that
has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment
of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code or which would result in a disallowed deduction under Section 162(m) of
the Code.   (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no, and at the Closing Date there will
be no, Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements with
respect to or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, after
the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
bound by any such Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements or have any
liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the
Closing Date.   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the

year beginning January 1, 1992, the Company has not incurred and does not
expect to incur through the Closing Date any liability for Taxes under
Section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event
has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will
be imposed upon the Company or its Subsidiaries; and   (j) The Company (i)
for all taxable years commencing with January 1, 1992 through December 31,
1999, has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all    
26  32 requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated

qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the date of the Effective
Time, (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
threatened. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is a state law partnership or
limited liability company has been since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income Tax purposes as a partnership (or a disregarded
entity) and not as a corporation or an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation. Except for WRESI and its direct
Subsidiaries, each other Subsidiary of the Company has been since its
formation, and continues to be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" as defined in Section 856(i) of the Code.
With respect to WRESI, since its formation, the Company has at no time held,
and does not now hold, directly or indirectly, any voting interest (or any
interest convertible into a voting interest) in WRESI. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company holds any Asset the disposition of which

an election under Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation section
1.337(d)-5T.   (k) The Company filed its federal income tax return for

employee benefit plans, and all unexpired severance agreements, written or
otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee
of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (together, the "Company Employee Plans").   (b) With respect to each
Company Employee Plan, the Company has made available to Pan Pacific, a true
and correct copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with
the IRS, (ii) such Company Employee Plan, (iii) each trust agreement and
group annuity contract, if any, relating to such Company Employee Plan and
(iv) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Company
Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.   (c) With respect to the
Company Employee Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has
occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or
set of circumstances in connection with which the Company could be subject to
any liability that will have a Company Material Adverse Effect under ERISA,
the Code or any other applicable law. There is no Company Employee Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan.     27  33

aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which contributions
have not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit
obligations which have not been accrued or otherwise properly disclosed in
the footnotes in accordance with GAAP, in the financial statements of
the Company, which obligations will cause a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) Except as disclosed in Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, and except as set forth in Section 3.12(e)
Company Disclosure Schedule, or as provided for in this Agreement, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i)

Company of the nature contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any
officer of the Company providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee extending for a period longer than one year from the date hereof
and for the payment of compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or (iii)
agreement or plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right
plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of
which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.13 PROPERTIES.   (a) Section 3.13(a) of the Company

to conduct its business as and where currently conducted. Each Company Real
Property is not subject to any Property Restrictions or Encumbrances, except
for any Permitted Encumbrances, any Property Restrictions or in the title
insurance policies set forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or any other     28  34 Permitted Encumbrances and Property
Restrictions and Encumbrances that do not, individually or in the aggregate,
cause a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except as set forth on
Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the
Company SEC Reports, the Company Real Property is not encumbered by any
debt.   (d) To the Company\'s Knowledge, all (i) certificates, permits or
licenses from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any
Company Real Property and (ii) agreements, easements or other rights,
necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of the buildings and
improvements on any of the Company Real Property or to permit the lawful use
and operation of all driveways, roads, and other means of egress and ingress
to and from any Company Real Property have been obtained and are in full
force and effect, except where the failure to obtain or maintain the same
would not cause a Company Material Adverse Effect, and there is no pending
threat or modification or cancellation of the same. No Company Real Property
is located outside of the United States and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries conducts its business of owning, leasing or operating
properties outside of the United States. All work to be performed, payments

Adverse Effect.   (e) The Company has not received since January 1, 1997
any written notice of any violation of any federal, state or municipal
law, ordinance, order, regulation or requirement affecting any portion of any
Company Real Property issued by any Governmental Entity which would cause a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 1997, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any

any zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance or regulation is being
violated by the maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other
improvements on any Company Real Property or by the maintenance, operation or
use of the parking areas, except where any such written notice of such a
proceeding or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, cause a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) Except as would not cause,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, (i) there are no material structural defects relating
to any Company Real Property, (ii) there is no Company Real Property whose

Pacific and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
substantially in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practices
(including the incurrence of trade indebtedness and secured debt assumed in
connection with the acquisition of properties by Pan Pacific or its
Subsidiaries), and there has not been any change in Pan Pacific\'s business,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, Assets
or liabilities, except for changes contemplated hereby or changes which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not caused or will not cause a Pan
Pacific Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.10 LITIGATION. Except as set
forth in the Pan Pacific SEC Reports or as set forth in Section 4.10 of the

may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction;   (c) Neither Pan Pacific
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any threatened
audits with respect to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1997,
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of Pan Pacific or any of its
Subsidiaries. With respect to taxable years ending on or after December 31,
1997, neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority (whether domestic or
foreign) has asserted against Pan Pacific or any of its Subsidiaries any
deficiency or claim for Taxes;   (d) Section 4.11(d) of the Pan Pacific
Disclosure Schedule sets forth each year for which an extension to file Tax
Returns has been requested and for which such Tax Returns have not yet been
filed;   (e) There are no liens for Taxes upon any Assets of Pan Pacific or
any Subsidiary thereof, except for liens for Taxes not yet due and payable,
and no written power of attorney that has been granted by Pan Pacific or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than to Pan Pacific or a Subsidiary, property tax

will be no, Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements with

liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the
Closing Date;   (g) None of Pan Pacific and its Subsidiaries (i) has been

Pacific and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise;   (h) Since Pan Pacific\'s taxable
year ending December 31, 1997, Pan Pacific has not incurred and does not
expect to incur through the Closing Date any liability for Taxes under
Section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, and neither Pan Pacific nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
in the ordinary course of     39  45 business. To the Knowledge of Pan
Pacific, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon Pan Pacific or its Subsidiaries.  
(i) Pan Pacific (i) for all taxable years commencing with 1997 through
December 31, 1999, has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied
all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since

continue to operate through the Effective Time in such a manner so as to
qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the date of the
Effective Time, (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending or, to Pan Pacific\'s Knowledge,
threatened. Each Subsidiary of Pan Pacific that is a state law partnership or
limited liability company has been since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income Tax purposes as a partnership (or a disregarded
entity) and not as a corporation or an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation. Each other Subsidiary of Pan Pacific
has been since its formation, and continues to be treated for federal income
Tax purposes as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" as defined in Section 856(i) of
the Code. Neither Pan Pacific nor any Subsidiary of Pan Pacific holds any
Asset (i) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under Notice 88-19 or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5T.   SECTION 4.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS.   (a) Pan Pacific has listed in Section 4.12 of the Pan
Pacific Disclosure Schedule all Benefit Arrangements, Multiemployer Plans,
Pension Plans and Welfare Plans of Pan Pacific and all bonus, stock option,
stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement,
change in control, severance and other similar employee benefit plans, and
all unexpired severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of,
or relating to, any current or former employee of Pan Pacific or any ERISA
Affiliate of Pan Pacific, or any Subsidiary of Pan Pacific (together, the
"Pan Pacific Employee Plans").   (b) With respect to each Pan Pacific
Employee Plan, Pan Pacific has made available to the Company, a true and
correct copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the
IRS, (ii) such Pan Pacific Employee Plan, (iii) each trust agreement and
group annuity contract, if any, relating to such Pan Pacific Employee Plan
and (iv) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Pan
Pacific Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.   (c) With respect to
the Pan Pacific Employee Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event
has occurred, and to the Knowledge of Pan Pacific, there exists no condition
or set of circumstances in connection with which Pan Pacific could be subject
to any liability that will have a Pan Pacific Material Adverse Effect under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable     40  46 law. There is no
Company Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or is a
Multiemployer Plan.   (d) With respect to the Pan Pacific Employee
Plans, individually and in the aggregate, there are no funded benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no unfunded benefit obligations which have not been accrued or
otherwise properly disclosed in the footnotes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, in the financial statements of Pan Pacific,
which obligations will cause a Pan Pacific Material Adverse Effect.   (e)
Except as disclosed in Pan Pacific SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, and except as set forth in Section 4.12(e) of the Pan Pacific
Disclosure Schedule, or as provided for in this Agreement, neither Pan
Pacific nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written
(i) agreement with any officer or other key employee of Pan Pacific or any of
its Subsidiaries, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which
are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving Pan
Pacific of the nature contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any
officer of Pan Pacific providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee extending for a period longer than one year from the date hereof
and for the payment of compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or (iii)
agreement or plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right
plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of
which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 4.13 PROPERTIES.   (a) Section 4.13(a) of the Pan
Pacific Disclosure Schedule identifies:   (i) all real properties (by name
and address) owned by Pan Pacific or its Subsidiaries (the "Pan Pacific Owned
Property") as of the date hereof, which are all of the real properties owned
by them as of the date hereof; and   (ii) all real properties leased or
operated by Pan Pacific or its Subsidiaries as lessee (the "Pan Pacific
Leased Property") as of the date hereof, which are all of the real properties
so leased or operated by them. The Pan Pacific Owned Property and the Pan
Pacific Leased Property is referred to herein collectively as the "Pan
Pacific Real Property."   (b) Pan Pacific and its Subsidiaries have obtained
title insurance policies for the Pan Pacific Real Property listed in Section
4.13(b) of the Pan Pacific Disclosure Schedule, and no material claims have
been made against any such policies by an insured party thereunder. With
respect to the Pan Pacific Real Property not listed in Section 4.13(b) of the
Pan Pacific Disclosure Schedule, Pan Pacific has good and marketable title to
the Pan Pacific Owned Property, and a valid leasehold interest in the Pan
Pacific Leased Property, sufficient to allow     41  47 each of Pan
Pacific and its Subsidiaries to conduct its business as and where currently
conducted. Each Pan Pacific Real Property is not subject to any Property
Restrictions or Encumbrances, except for any Permitted Encumbrances, any
Property Restrictions or in the title insurance policies set forth in Section
4.13(b) of the Pan Pacific Disclosure Schedule, or any other
Permitted Encumbrances and Property Restrictions and Encumbrances that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, cause a Pan Pacific Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) Except as set forth on Section 4.13(c) of the Pan
Pacific Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the Pan Pacific SEC Reports,
the Pan Pacific Real Property is not encumbered by any debt.   (d) To the
Pan Pacific\'s Knowledge, all (i) certificates, permits or licenses from any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any Pan Pacific Real Property
and (ii) agreements, easements or other rights, necessary to permit the
lawful use and operation of the buildings and improvements on any of the Pan
Pacific Real Property or to permit the lawful use and operation of all
driveways, roads, and other means of egress and ingress to and from any Pan
Pacific Real Property have been obtained and are in full force and effect
except where the failure to obtain or maintain the same would not cause a Pan
Pacific Material Adverse Effect and there is no pending threat
or modification or cancellation of the same. All work to be performed,
payments to be made and financial undertakings required to be taken by Pan
Pacific or its Subsidiaries prior to June 30, 2000 pursuant to any contract
entered into with a Governmental Entity in connection with a site approval,
zoning reclassification or other similar action relating to a Pan Pacific
Real Property has been paid or undertaken, as the case may be, except where
the failure to pay such amount or undertake such action would not cause a Pan
Pacific Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Pan Pacific has not received since
January 1, 1997 any written notice of any violation of any federal, state or
municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or requirement affecting any
portion of any Pan Pacific Real Property issued by any Governmental Entity
which would cause a Pan Pacific Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1,
1997, neither Pan Pacific nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over Pan

ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST; FINAL COMPANY DIVIDEND. From and after the date
hereof through the Effective Time, each of Company and Pan Pacific will
maintain its respective qualification as a "real estate investment trust"

generality of the foregoing, if necessary to enable the Company to make

Minimum Distribution Dividend (after taking into account the dividend paid in
accordance with Section 5.4), the Company shall declare and pay a dividend
(the "Final Company Dividend") to holders of Company Common Shares in an

Pacific Common Stock in an amount per share equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the Final Company Dividend per Company Common Share by (y) the
Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "Minimum
Distribution Dividend" shall mean a distribution with respect to the

of excise tax under Section 4981 of the Code.   SECTION 5.4 DIVIDEND PAYMENT

by the Parties, as soon as practicable after November 15, 2000; (ii) the
Company shall set a record date for its regular fourth quarter 2000 dividend

authorize, declare and pay (or commit to pay) such dividend in the amount of
$0.28 per share to holders of record of Company Common Shares at that date;
and (iii) Pan Pacific shall set a record date for a special dividend on or
before November 15, 2000, and shall be entitled to pay a special dividend in
the amount of $0.28 per share to holders of record of Pan Pacific Common
Stock at that date.   (b) With respect to dividends in respect of Pan
Pacific Common Stock and Company Common Shares permitted under this Agreement
other than those referred to in Section 5.4(a), each of Pan Pacific and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration and the record and
payment dates therefor, it being the intention of the Parties that holders of
Company Common Shares shall not receive (i) dividends for any single calendar
quarter with respect to both Company Common Shares and shares of Pan Pacific
Common Stock received in exchange therefor in connection with the Merger or
(ii) fail to receive dividends for any single calendar quarter on shares of
Company Common Shares or shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock received in
exchange therefor in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding     52 
58 the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(b), Pan Pacific\'s
declaration of any such dividends shall be at its option.   SECTION 5.5

connection with the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
the Registration Statement. The Company hereby agrees that the
recommendations of the Company Board described in Section 3.20 (subject to
the right of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify
such recommendation in accordance with Section 6.3) may be included in
the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Pan
Pacific shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions
required under any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in
connection with the issuance of shares of Pan Pacific Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger and will pay all filing fees incident thereto. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective, the Company
and Pan Pacific shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to their respective shareholders or stockholders.     53  59  (b) The
Company and Pan Pacific each agrees that none of the information supplied by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by reference
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, will, on the date of the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and at the time
of the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Pan Pacific Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Company and Pan Pacific each agrees that none of
the information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries to be included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.   (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior
to the Effective Time (i) the Company and Pan Pacific shall notify each other
as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance
which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and (ii) the
Company and Pan Pacific shall each notify the other as promptly as
practicable after the receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the
SEC on, or of any written or oral request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with
respect to any of the foregoing filings.   (d) The Company and Pan Pacific
shall each take all action necessary to duly call the Company Shareholders
Meeting and the Pan Pacific Stockholders Meeting, respectively, each to be
held as promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting upon the approval
of the Company Voting Proposals, in the case of the Company, and the Pan
Pacific Voting Proposals, in the case of Pan Pacific. Subject to the right of
the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in
accordance with Section 6.3, each of the Company and Pan Pacific shall,
through its respective board of trustees or board of directors, as
applicable, recommend to their respective stockholders adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger and related matters, shall
coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings and
shall use their best efforts to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and Pan
Pacific Stockholders Meeting on the same day and each of the Company and Pan
Pacific shall use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposals, in the case of the Company,
and the Pan Pacific Voting Proposals, in the case of Pan Pacific. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) to conduct the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.    
54  60  SECTION 6.2 COOPERATION; NOTICE; CURE. Subject to compliance
with applicable law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of
Pan Pacific and the Company shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with
one or more Representatives of the other Party to report on the general
status of ongoing operations. Each of Pan Pacific and the Company shall
promptly notify the other in writing of, and will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event, transaction or
circumstance, as soon as reasonably practical after it becomes known to such
Party, that causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Pan Pacific or
the Company, as the case may be, under this Agreement to be breached in any
material respect or that renders or will render untrue in any material
respect any representation or warranty of Pan Pacific or the Company
contained in this Agreement. No notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall
have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any
condition contained herein.   SECTION 6.3 NO SOLICITATION.   (a) Subject
to Section 6(b), unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated
by either party pursuant to Article VIII hereof, the Company shall not take
or cause, directly or indirectly (through representatives, agents or
otherwise), any of the following actions with any party other than Pan
Pacific or its designees: (i) solicit, encourage, initiate or participate in
any negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any offer or
proposal to acquire all or any part of its business, assets or capital shares
whether by merger, consolidation, other business combination, purchase
of assets, tender or exchange offer or otherwise, other than an offer or
proposal with respect to a sale transaction permitted under Section 5.1
hereof (each of the foregoing, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) disclose, in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, any information or provide access to
its properties, books or records, except as required by law or pursuant to a
governmental request for information; (iii) enter into or execute any
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) make or authorize any
public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Merger, or as otherwise
required by applicable law. Nothing in this Section 6.3(a) shall limit the
ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to sell Assets in accordance with
Section 5.1(f) hereof.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a
bona fide, unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party (that
does not result from a breach of this Section 6.3), the Company Board may,
and may authorize and permit the Company\'s officers, trustees, employees,
financial advisors, representatives, or agents to, (i) provide such Third
Party with nonpublic information, (ii) otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt by such Third Party to make or implement such Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) agree to or recommend or endorse any such Acquisition Proposal with or
by any Third Party, (iv) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Pan Pacific, its approval and
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement, (v) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Third Party relating to such
Acquisition Proposal and (vi) cause the Company to enter into an
agreement     55  61 implementing an Acquisition Proposal, provided that
the Company simultaneously terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(g), if and only to the extent that (x) the Company Board believes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is more favorable or is likely to result in an Acquisition Proposal
that is more favorable to the Company Shareholders from a financial point of
view than the Merger and is made by a Person believed by the Company Board to
be reasonably capable of completing such Acquisition Proposal (a "Superior
Proposal"), (y) the Company Board, after having consulted with and considered
the advice of outside counsel, has reasonably determined in good faith that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to cause the members of the
Company Board to breach their legal duties to shareholders of the Company
under applicable law and (z) the Third Party has entered into a
confidentiality agreement pertaining to nonpublic information regarding the
Company containing terms in the aggregate no more favorable to the Third
Party than those in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company agrees that,
in the event of a Superior Proposal, for the five Business Day period
commencing on the date on which it delivers notice of such Superior Proposal
to Pan Pacific in accordance with Section 6.3(c), it shall offer to negotiate
with, and cause its respective financial and legal advisors to negotiate
with, Pan Pacific to attempt to make such commercially reasonable adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Pan Pacific to
proceed with the transactions contemplated herein.   (c) The Company shall
notify Pan Pacific reasonably promptly after receipt by the Company (or any
of their advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
Company\'s properties, books or records by any person or entity that informs
the Company that is it considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate
the status thereof (including the specific terms thereof but not the identity
of the Third Party making such request or Acquisition Proposal). The Company
shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar day) furnish to Pan
Pacific a copy of any written proposals relating to a possible Acquisition
Proposal and copies of any written information provided to or by any third
party relating thereto to the extent such information has not previously been
provided to Pan Pacific (but redacting the name of the Third Party). The
Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar day) advise Pan
Pacific in writing of any material changes to the terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall
prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel (who may
be its regularly engaged outside counsel) that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
shareholders under any applicable law, provided, however, that neither the
Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof may, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.3 or required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw
or modify, its position with respect to this     56  62 Agreement or the
Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
an Acquisition Proposal.   SECTION 6.4 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon
reasonable notice, each of Pan Pacific and the Company (and each of their
respective Subsidiaries) shall afford to the other Party and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its personnel, properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of Pan
Pacific and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other (a) copies of monthly
financial reports and development reports, (b) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other documents filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (c) all other information concerning its business,
Assets, personnel and tax status as the other Party may reasonably request;
provided, however the foregoing shall not require the Company or Pan Pacific
to permit any inspection or disclose any information that would result in the
disclosure of confidential information of Third Parties or violate a
confidentiality obligation of such party or any material bearing on an
Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date of this Agreement by any Third
Party, or the identity of any Third Party making any Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof, or any advice or analysis by the Company or any of its
representatives of the Company or any such Third Party or any such
Acquisition Proposal or of any report from its financial advisors, counsel or
management regarding Pan Pacific. Each Party making such requests will hold
any such information furnished to it by the other Party or Parties which is
nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the letter agreement dated as of
July 25, 2000, among Pan Pacific, Revenue Properties Company Limited and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to an executive officer of
the Company or Pan Pacific, as the case may be, or such Person designated by
such officers. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger.   SECTION 6.5
TERMINATION OF COMPANY\'S 401(k) PLAN. Unless Pan Pacific otherwise requests
in writing, prior to the Closing, (i) the Company Board shall adopt
resolutions terminating, effective prior to the Effective Time,
the Company\'s Investment 401(k) Plan (each such plan, a "Company 401(k)
Plan") and (ii) amend the Company 401(k) Plan in the manner necessary to
cause the tax-qualified status of such Company 401(k) Plan to be maintained
at the time of termination.   SECTION 6.6 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.   (a)
The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, registrations, licenses, consents, variances,
exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of     57  63 all Third
Parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Governmental Approvals"),
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental
Approvals. Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives and other Affiliates to, file within 30 days after the date
hereof, and in all events shall file within 60 days after the date hereof,
all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining
the Governmental Approvals and shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter
in responding to additional requests in connection therewith. Pan Pacific and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to Pan Pacific and the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and stockholders which
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third
Party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Pan
Pacific and the Company (the "Notifying Party") will notify the other
promptly of the receipt of comments or requests from Governmental Entities
relating to Governmental Approvals, and will supply the other Party with
copies of all correspondence between the Notifying Party or any of its
Representatives and Governmental Entities with respect to Governmental
Approvals.   (b) Pan Pacific and the Company shall promptly advise
each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any approval needed from a
Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed. Pan Pacific and the Company shall take
any and all actions reasonably necessary to vigorously defend, lift, mitigate
and rescind the effect of any litigation or administrative proceeding
adversely affecting this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including, without limitation, promptly appealing any adverse court
or administrative order or injunction to the extent reasonably necessary for
the foregoing purposes.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, Pan Pacific shall have no obligation or
affirmative duty under this Section 6.6 to cease or refrain from the
ownership of any Assets, or the association with any Person which association
is material to the operations of Pan Pacific, whether on the date hereof or
at any time in the future.   SECTION 6.7 PUBLICITY. Pan Pacific and the
Company shall agree on the form and content of the initial press release
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or other public statement
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by law or obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with, or rules of any national securities exchange.    
58  64  SECTION 6.8 AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS. No later than 45 days prior to
the Closing the Company shall deliver to Pan Pacific a list identifying, in
the view of the Company, each person who will be, at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, a Company Affiliate. The Company shall provide to Pan
Pacific such information and documents as Pan Pacific shall reasonably
request for purposes of reviewing such list and shall notify Pan Pacific in
writing regarding any change in the identity of the Company Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date; provided, however, that no such Person identified to Pan
Pacific shall be added to the list of Company Affiliates if Pan Pacific shall
receive from the Company, on or before the date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Pan Pacific to the
effect that such Person is not a Company Affiliate. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Pan Pacific as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 15 days prior to the
Closing (and in any case prior to the Effective Time) an Affiliate Agreement
from each of its Affiliates.   SECTION 6.9 TAX TREATMENT OF
REORGANIZATION.   (a) The Parties intend the Merger to qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and shall use their best
efforts (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their best
efforts) to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither the Company, Pan Pacific,
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is not specifically provided for by
this Agreement that would or would be reasonably likely to adversely affect
the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code. Pan Pacific and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, take the position for all purposes that the Merger qualifies
as a reorganization under that Section of the Code. None of the Company, Pan
Pacific, or any Subsidiary of either makes any representation or warranty to
the other(s) or to any stockholder regarding the tax treatment of the Merger
or whether the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the Code. Each
of the Company, Pan Pacific, and the Subsidiaries of both acknowledge that
they are relying on their own advisors in connection with the Tax treatment
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(b) Pan Pacific and the Company shall cooperate and use their best efforts in
obtaining the opinions of O\'Melveny and Myers, LLP, counsel to the Company,
and Latham and Watkins, counsel to Pan Pacific, dated as of the Closing Date,
to the effect that the Merger will qualify for federal income tax purposes as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Pan Pacific and Company shall use their best efforts to provide O\'Melveny and
Myers, LLP and Latham and Watkins with such representations or certificates as
may reasonably be required to enable such counsel to render the opinions
referred to in the preceding sentence.   SECTION 6.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES
AND ACTIONS. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the Parties
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the     59  65 transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) using their respective
reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities and
parties to contracts with each Party as are necessary for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to fulfill all
conditions precedent applicable to such Party pursuant to this Agreement,
subject, in the case of the Company, to the rights of the Company and the
Company Board under Sections 6.3(b), 6.3(c) and 8.1(g).   SECTION 6.11 STOCK
EXCHANGE LISTING. Pan Pacific shall use its best efforts to list on the NYSE

reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Pan Pacific a letter of
KPMG LLP, the Company\'s independent auditors, dated (i) a date within two
Business Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall
become effective and (ii) the Closing Date, in each case addressed to Pan
Pacific and its directors, in form reasonably satisfactory to Pan Pacific and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement.   SECTION 6.13 LETTER OF PAN PACIFIC\'S ACCOUNTANTS.
Pan Pacific shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the
Company and Pan Pacific a letter of KPMG LLP, Pan Pacific\'s independent

the Registration Statement shall become effective and (ii) the Closing Date,
in each case addressed to the Company and its directors, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Registration Statement.   SECTION 6.14 COMPANY
REIT STATUS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking,
and the Company hereby agrees to take, any action at any time or from time to
time that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board, upon advice of
counsel, is legally necessary for the Company to maintain its qualification
as a REIT within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code for any period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including
without limitation, making dividend or distribution payments to shareholders
of the Company in accordance with Section 5.3 or otherwise.   SECTION 6.15
PAN PACIFIC REIT STATUS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth

Party hereto.   SECTION 6.20 ACQUISITION OF WRESI STOCK. Pan Pacific will

the Surviving Company shall provide exculpation and indemnification for each
Person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, trustee or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (together with the WRESI Shareholders (as
defined below)     62  68 the "Indemnified Parties") which is the same
as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by
the Company or WPT and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time in their respective Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date
hereof; provided, that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on

"WRESI Shareholders") for all actions on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by law.   (b) In addition
to the rights provided in Section 6.22(a) above, in the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,

action by or on behalf of any or all security holders of the Company, WPT, or
Pan Pacific, or any Subsidiary of the Company or Pan Pacific, or by or in the
right of the Company, WPT, or Pan Pacific, or any Subsidiary of the Company
or Pan Pacific, or any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(collectively, for this Section 6.22 "Claims") in which any Indemnified Party
is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is
or was an officer, employee, trustee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any action or omission or alleged action or omission by such
Person in his capacity as an officer, employee, trustee or director, or (ii)
the Company Transaction Documents or the Company DownREIT

contemplated thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, Pan Pacific and the Surviving Company (the "Indemnifying
Parties") shall from and after the Effective Time jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any
losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement arising out of
or relating to any such Claims. Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties hereby agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in the defense of such Claims. In connection with any such Claim,
the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select and retain one
counsel, at the cost of the Indemnifying Parties, subject to the consent of
the Indemnifying Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In addition, after the Effective Time, in the event of any such
threatened or actual Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly pay and
advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred by each Indemnified Person as
they become due and payable in advance of the final disposition of the Claim
to the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, such undertaking to be accepted without regard to the
creditworthiness of the Indemnified Party, to repay any expenses advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent
(which consent shall not be     63  69 unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in

no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company\'s trustees, directors and
officers, as the case may be, currently covered by such insurance than those
of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that in the
event that the aggregate premiums for insurance for the benefit of persons
currently covered by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\'
insurance policy under this Section 6.22(c) are in excess of 150% of the
aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 1999 on an annualized basis for
such purpose then Pan Pacific shall only be obligated to maintain such
insurance coverage as is reasonably available for such amount.   (d) This
Section 6.22 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third-
party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns and
heirs and shall be binding on all successors and assigns Pan Pacific,
including without limitation the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section
6.22 and Pan Pacific acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified
Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists
for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to injunctive relief and specific performance in the event of any breach of
any provision in this Section 6.22.   (e) In the event that the Surviving
Company or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, the successors and assigns of such entity shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.22, which obligations are
expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each director and officer covered hereby.     64  70

Pan Pacific\'s payment of the Expenses incurred by the Company pursuant to

Pan Pacific and any of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives with respect
to the occurrences giving rise to such     70  76 payment, except for

shall pay Pan Pacific a Break-Up Fee if any of the following events
occur:   (i) the termination of this Agreement by either Pan Pacific or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), if a proposal for an Alternative

the Company Shareholders Meeting and either a definitive agreement for an
Alternative Transaction is entered into, or such Alternative Transaction
(or another Alternative Transaction with the proponent of such transaction or
an Affiliate of such proponent) is consummated, within twelve months of

stockholders of a Third Party) acquires more than 27.5% of the outstanding
Company Common Shares or 27.5% of the equity securities of the entity
surviving such merger or business combination, or (iii) any other transaction
pursuant to which any Third Party acquires control of assets (including for
this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of the Company
and the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of
them) of the Company having a fair market value (as determined by the Company
Board in good faith) equal to more than 27.5% of the fair market value of all
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately
prior to such transaction.     71  77  (e) The "Break-Up Fee" shall be
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Base Amount (as defined below) and

causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), and (b) Pan Pacific has
$1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Pan
Pacific which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by
independent accountants to Pan Pacific. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event Pan Pacific receives a reasoned opinion from outside counsel or a
ruling from the IRS (the "Tax Guidance") providing that Pan Pacific\'s
receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code (the "REIT Requirements"), the Break-Up Fee shall be
an amount equal to the Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving
notice that Pan Pacific has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Pan Pacific the
unpaid Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event that Pan Pacific
is not able to receive the full Base Amount due to the above limitations, the
Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three
days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Pan Pacific
unless and until Pan Pacific receives either one or a combination of the
following once or more often: (i) a letter from Pan Pacific\'s independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Pan Pacific without causing Pan Pacific to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
(calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which
events the Company shall pay to Pan Pacific the lesser of the unpaid Base
Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above
within five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The
payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be compensation and liquidated damages for
the loss suffered by Pan Pacific as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the
circumstances and neither Party shall have any other liability to the other
after the payment of the Break-Up Fee. The obligation of Company to pay any
unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate on the December 31
following the date which is three years from the date of this Agreement.
Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the
Break-Up Fee terminates shall be released to the Company. As used in this
Section 8.2(e), the "Base Amount" shall mean $7,000,000; provided that the
Base Amount shall mean $10,000,000 if the Break-Up Fee is payable under (a)
Section 8.2(c)(i) as a result of an Alternative Transaction publicly
announced after November 1, 2000, or (b) under Section 8.2(c)(ii)
in connection with (i) an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, (ii)
a tender or exchange offer commenced, or (iii) a recommendation by the
Company Board of an Alternative Transaction, in each case after November 1,
2000 or (c) under Section 8.2(c)(iii) in connection with the receipt by the
Company of a Superior Proposal after November 1, 2000.   SECTION 8.3 EFFECT
OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Pan Pacific as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Pan Pacific or the Company or their respective officers, members or
directors except as (i) set forth in     72  78 Section 8.2, (ii) with

as a result of the willful breach by the other party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement and (iii) with respect to provisions that survive the
termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.1.   SECTION 8.4 AMENDMENT. This
Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards at any time before or after any required approval of
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company and the stockholders of Pan Pacific; provided, however, that after
any such approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires
further approval by such shareholders or stockholders without the further
approval of such shareholders or stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties.   SECTION
8.5 WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing Date, any Party may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or
Parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.   ARTICLE IX.  GENERAL
