and procedures to effect an orderly exchange. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further

Paying Agent to Parent, and any holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no greater
rights against Parent than may be accorded to a general unsecured creditor of
Parent under applicable Law.

Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or their respective Representatives
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the one (1) -year

Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,

converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Survivng
Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger

as provided above in this paragraph, (ii) use its best efforts to obtain an
option surrender agreement from each Company Stock Option Holder who is

(c) Necessary Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including
obtaining any employee consents) that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 3.3.

 

 

(d) Withholding. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid
without interest. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over

or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Employee Plan

material benefit or creation of any material obligation) under, or require a
consent, waiver, approval, authorization or notice under, constitute a change
in control under, require the payment of a material penalty under or result

(iii) of this Section 4.3(b) for any matters which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) Absence of Required Consents. No consent, approval, license, permit,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing

(d) Required Vote. The affirmative vote for approval of the Merger by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on
the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock or other
securities necessary to adopt this Agreement and for the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(e) Actions by the Company Board. The Company Board, at a meeting duly called

operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely
affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. For
purposes of the foregoing, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material

(including, where applicable, ERISA and the Code) and the regulations
thereunder and in all respects in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee Plan and
has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such contributions
on the Company Balance Sheet). All filings and reports as to each Company
Employee Plan required to have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service
or to the United States Department of Labor have been submitted. With respect
to the Company Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and there exists no
condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which the Company or

made or properly accrued as required by such Company Employee Plan or
applicable Law, and there are no material benefit obligations which have not

Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the
books and records of such Company Employee Plan if so required under the

Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Employee Plan is so qualified
and the plan and trust related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes
under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. If a
determination, opinion or advisory letter has been issued with respect to any
Company Employee Plan, such determination, opinion or advisory letter has not
been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, no act or omission has
occurred, that, in any case, could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
its qualification.

 

 

(f) Absence of Certain Obligations. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored, maintained or
contributed to a Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412
of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No Company Employee Plan is funded by a
"voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(f) or Section
4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Employee Plan holds
securities issued by the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates.

benefits, and any of the Company's Subsidiaries which are a party thereto may
terminate their participation therein in accordance with the applicable
Company Employee Plan documents at any time without material liability to the
Company or its Subsidiary other than the payment of benefits, and subject to
applicable Law. No Company Employee Plan, plan document or agreement, summary
plan description or other written communication distributed generally to
Company Persons, by its terms prohibits the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan sponsored
or maintained principally by such Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, in
accordance with the Company Employee Plan document.

6.2 Acquisition Proposals.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.2(b), following the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article IX, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other agents, advisors
or representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, other agents, advisors and representatives
collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, encourage (including by way of providing information), facilitate or
induce the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or otherwise encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
except as provided in Section 6.2(d) or (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, option agreement or other similar
Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent after receipt of an actual or proposed Acquisition Proposal
orally and in writing (which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person submitting the same).
The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall ensure that its Representatives and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives are aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt
of the Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that was not received in violation of Section
6.2(a) and that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
then the Company may, prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval and
subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.2, (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
(and its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (and
its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal ("Permitted Actions") if the Company Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to take
such Permitted Action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. With respect to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company
will not, and will not allow its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into one
or more confidentiality agreements with such Person on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the NDA
("Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements") and will promptly provide Parent
with a copy of such executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any
information provided thereunder not previously provided to Parent; and
provided further that the Company shall have delivered written notice to
Parent at least two (2) Business Days in advance of taking any action
permitted pursuant to subclauses (A) and (B) of clause (ii) of this Section
6.2(b). The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
following the Company's Knowledge of, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after, receipt thereof) notify Parent and Purchaser orally and
in writing (which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal and the Person submitting the same) in the event it
receives an Acquisition Proposal (or any communication from a Person that
such Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal) from a Person or
group of related Persons and shall keep Parent and Purchaser reasonably
informed orally and in writing as to the status and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same, including
prompt written notice to Parent of any determination by the Company Board (or
any special committee thereof) that a Superior Proposal has been made.

 

 

(c) Except as permitted by Section 6.2(d), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) amend, withdraw, modify,
change, condition or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) except as permitted by Section
6.2(f), take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent
with the Recommendation.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(c), at any time prior to
the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, in response to a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may withdraw, modify, change, condition or qualify the
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Purchaser ("Change in
Board Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Company Board may not
effect a Change in Board Recommendation pursuant to this Section
6.2(d) unless: (i) the Company has complied with this Section 6.2; (ii) (A)
the Company has delivered a Notice of Superior Proposal to Parent and (B)
either (1) Parent does not make a Matching Bid on or before the fifth (5th)
Business Day following Parent's actual receipt of such Notice of Superior
Proposal or (2) following receipt of a Matching Bid within such five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel and after
taking into consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior Proposal to
which the Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior
Proposal (provided that any material amendment to the terms of such Superior
Proposal after the initial Notice of Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and restart the five (5) Business Day
period referred to above) and (iii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to effect a Change in Board Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, at any
time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in
response to a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) and concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the transactions contemplated
by such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement unless: (i) the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of this Section 6.2; (ii) (A) the
Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent if Parent has notified the
Company of its intent to submit a Matching Bid or (B) Parent has not made a
Matching Bid and five (5) Business Days have elapsed since the Company has
provided the Notice of Superior Proposal and, in each case, the Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to effect such termination would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iv) the Company has
complied with all applicable requirements of Section 9.3(b) (including the
payment of the Termination Fee prior to or on the date of such termination)
in connection with such Superior Proposal.

 

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure other than (x) a
"stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company), (y) an express rejection
of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (z) an express reaffirmation of its
Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company in favor of the Merger
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or
resolve to take any action prohibited by Section  6.2(d).

 

 

6.3 Certain Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) promptly notify Parent of any
Proceeding arising from the date hereof until the Effective Date against or
with respect to the Company or any Subsidiaries in respect of any material
Tax and not settle or compromise any such Proceeding or other action without
Parent's prior written consent and (ii) promptly provide to Parent a written
copy of any U.S. Federal income Tax Return filed with the Internal Revenue
Service during the period from the date hereof through the Effective Date.

 

 

(b) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into
or effect any transaction that would result in a material recognition of
income or gain by the Company or any Subsidiary, other than transactions
entered into or effected in the Ordinary Course of Business.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

6.4 Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust. In the event that, prior to the
Stockholder Approval, the Nu Horizons Electronic Corp. Employee Stock
Ownership Plan and Trust has not been terminated, and all assets thereof have
not been distributed to the participants and beneficiaries thereto, the
Company shall retain an independent fiduciary to vote the shares of the
Company held under such plan and trust at any Company Stockholders
Meeting held in connection with the Merger.

in connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken
by either Parent or the Company to effect the Merger and to consummate the
other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall not, without
Parent's prior written consent, commit to, and none of Parent or Purchaser
shall be required to (a) propose or agree to accept any undertaking or
condition, enter into any consent decree, effect any divestiture, hold
separate any assets, business or other holdings or otherwise take or commit
to take any action, that (1) limits its or its Affiliates' freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company or any of the

file or mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to
the Company's stockholders prior to consultation with Parent and

notice to Parent of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
by the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (b) the failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notification shall be deemed to cure any
breach or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company or waive the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control, direct or interfere
with the operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its business
operations.

 

 

7.5 Access to Information.

 

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall

prior to the Effective Time, to all of the Company's and all of its
Subsidiaries' properties, books, records, Contracts, commitments and
personnel and shall furnish Parent all financial, operating and other data
and information as Parent may request. Unless otherwise required by Law,
Parent will hold any such information which is non-public in confidence in
accordance with the NDA. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.5 or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in the Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is understood and agreed to by
each party that (i) any exchange of information under this Agreement shall
not affect, in any way, each party's relative competitive position to the
other party or to other entities and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
may deny access to any information if the Company believes, upon advice of
outside counsel, that providing access to such information to Parent and its
Representatives would violate applicable antitrust Laws or any
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (which the Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the counterparty thereto to
waive).

 

 

(b) The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the NDA, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP to allow Parent full and complete

of income, cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal year then ended.

 

 

7.6 Public Disclosure. Except as may be required by Law or applicable stock
exchange rules, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed by
the Company and Parent and (b) Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any other press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release
prior using such efforts; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
7.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure which
its counsel deems necessary in order to satisfy such party's disclosure
obligations imposed by Law or stock exchange rules. Parent and the Company
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing, and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any written communications to Company employees with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger.

 

 

7.7 Indemnification.

 

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless (including advancement of expenses) the current and former directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Covered Parties") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to
the fullest extent provided in their respective Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws or similar governing instruments as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that such indemnification shall be subject to
any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. For a period
of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, provide for indemnification and exculpation of
the Covered Persons in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, other than such acts or omissions deemed by an applicable
arbitral or judicial body in a final non-appealable order or judgment to be
gross negligence or willful misconduct, in a manner consistent with and no
less favorable than the indemnification and exculpation provisions with
respect to the Covered Parties that are presently set forth in the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or similar
governing instruments and any indemnification agreement between the Company
and any Covered Party.

 

 

(b) Parent agrees that the Company and, from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation, shall cause to be maintained in effect for not
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the insurance coverage
provided under the policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company at the date of this Agreement; provided, that (i)
after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies issued by reputable and financially sound
carriers reasonably acceptable to the beneficiaries of such policies that
provide at least the same coverage, on terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such persons but only if such substitution does not result in
any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess of two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement; and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain
the insurance required by this Section, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for such six-year period for an annual premium equal to
such maximum amount. Parent's obligations under this paragraph may be
satisfied by the purchase of a "tail" insurance policy that provides the
coverage described above.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
honor all indemnification agreements between the Company and the Covered
Parties in effect as of the date hereof.

 

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effect the purposes of this Section 7.7, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7; provided,
however, that, in the case of any such assignment by the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement. The obligations under this Section
7.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 7.7 applies without the written
consent of such affected indemnitee. This Section 7.7 shall survive the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Covered Persons, and shall be
enforceable by any of them.

 

 

7.8 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to
this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no settlement of
any such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

7.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and
result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director
or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

 

7.10 Post-Closing Employment Matters. Subject to Section 7.10(e), Parent
covenants as follows:

 

 

(a) From the Closing Date until its first (1st) anniversary, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide
each active employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time (each, an "Employee") with benefits and compensation that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits and compensation,
excluding equity and equity-based incentive plans and individual agreements,
that are provided by the Company to the Employee immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.10 shall be deemed to
prohibit Parent from, at any time after the Effective Time, changing the
title, rank or job duties of any Employee or from terminating any Employee.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan in
which any Employee will participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, recognize all
service of the Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and, only
in the case of any Parent Benefit Plan that provides vacation benefits or any
other form of paid time-off benefits, for purposes of benefit accrual, under
any such Parent Benefit Plan, but only to the extent such service was
recognized under a similar Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

 

 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Employees under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in
which such Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing
Date under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Benefit
Plans that are welfare plans in which such Employees are eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date, in each of cases (i) and (ii) above,
without duplication of benefits.

 

 

(d) If any Employee is terminated from employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date and
before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, such Employee shall be
eligible to receive severance benefits comparable to those that would have
been provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Employee under the
terms of any generally applicable severance policy of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.10 shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular Company Employee Plan or
Parent Benefit Plan, other than as set forth in Section 7.10 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or (B) retain the employment of any particular Employee
or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person, including
any current or former Company Person.

 

 

7.11 Maintenance of Insurance Policies. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all of the Insurance Policies
will be in full force and effect following the Effective Time.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.12 Further Assurances. From and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 

 

7.13 No Other Representations. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that the Company has not made and is not making any representations
or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied, except as provided in Article IV, and that Parent and
Purchaser are not relying and has not relied on any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied, except as provided in Article IV. The Company

Purchaser or the Company hereunder, except as set forth in this Section 9.2

representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)

privileges, but the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect
as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred. The waiver by a party of
any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement
or of any right or privilege conferred by this Agreement shall not be

rights or privileges or as a waiver of any other terms, covenants,
conditions, rights or privileges. No waiver shall be effective unless it is
in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

designated by notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section
10.2.

 

 

10.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Voting Agreements, together
with all annexes, appendices, articles, exhibits, schedules hereto and
thereto, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to
the subject matter hereof, provided, however, that, except as expressly
stated otherwise herein, the NDA shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms.

 

 

10.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for Section 7.7, this Agreement is
not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon
any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

 

 

10.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent
and/or Purchaser may assign this Agreement or assign or delegate any of
Parent's and/or Purchaser's rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without
the consent of the Company, provided that Parent and/or Purchaser, as the
case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

10.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

 

10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. Any signature page hereto delivered by
facsimile machine or by e-mail (including in portable document format (pdf),
as a joint photographic experts group (jpg) file, or otherwise) shall be
binding to the same extent as an original signature page, with regard to any
agreement subject to the terms hereof or any amendment thereto. Any party who
delivers such a signature page agrees to later deliver an original
counterpart to any party who requests it.

10.8 Governing Law. The formation, construction, and performance of this
Agreement, including the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, shall be
construed, interpreted, governed, applied and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements entered into and
performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to any
provisions relating to conflicts of laws among different jurisdictions.

 

 

10.9 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party(ies) hereto or such
party's successors or assigns shall be brought, heard and determined
exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (the
"Court"), provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is
unavailable in the Court, then any such action or proceeding shall
be brought, heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal
court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby (A)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of such courts for such litigation (but not other litigation);
and (B) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Court
and agrees not to plead or claim that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to validly serve process, (ii) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest
extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

 

10.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto may seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
