the stockholder of the Company in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.   (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund which  ---------------------------- remains undistributed

----------- shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock.   12    (h) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,

Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to have -------------- such
shares appraised in accordance with the provisions of Section 92A.300
to 92A.500, inclusive, of the NGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held

receive, without any interest thereon, certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends to the extent provided in Section 3.2(c)
hereof to be issued or paid  -------------- in consideration therefor upon

Parent.  4.2 Authority. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to  --------- enter into this Agreement, to perform its

Special Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent from --- taking and
disclosing to Parent\'s shareholders a position as required by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any tender
or exchange offer, provided that such disclosure states that no action will
be taken by the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company
in violation of this Section 6.12. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this  ------------ Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent may, in
connection with a possible Superior Proposal, refer any third party to this
Section 6.12 and make  ------------ a copy of this Section 6.12 available to
a third party.  ------------   (b) In the event that the Merger is not
