Parent in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with

2  ( _a_ ) the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in their entirety to be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ,
until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 5.10_, as provided therein or

ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each Share, other than Excluded Shares, shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive $115.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ " and in the aggregate for all Shares, other than
Excluded Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Section 2.1_ shall be automatically canceled upon the conversion
thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes), without
interest.

 

(b) Each Share that is owned directly immediately prior to the Effective Time
by ( _i_ ) any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, (
_ii_ ) Parent or ( _iii_ ) Merger Sub (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_
") shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation. 

 



3 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

In accordance with Section 554(3) of the OBCA, no holder of Shares shall be
entitled to exercise dissenter, appraisal or similar rights in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by
Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as a paying agent
hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the
Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in
exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Excluded Shares), payable upon due surrender of the
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1_, Parent
shall, or shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to make
such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_
that ( _i_ ) any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available) or in similar investments reasonably satisfactory
to the Company, and ( _ii_ ) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



4 (b)

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ( _A_ ) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree, and ( _B_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive from the
Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (
_A_ ) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and
( _B_ ) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance
with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Share.

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Law with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted
or withheld amounts ( _A_ ) shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the
appropriate Taxing

 



5  Authority and ( _B_ ) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for
transfer, the holder of Certificates shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in _Section 2.2(b)_ and instructed to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of
Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have
not surrendered their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying
Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company Options with respect to any of such
holders Company Options, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested,
that has an exercise price per Share that is less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration and that is

 



6  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested and be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
( _i_ ) the excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Share of such Company Option and ( _ii_ ) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company Option (such amount, the " _Option Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that has an exercise price per
Share that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration,
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and the holder of
such Company Option shall not be entitled to receive any payment in exchange
for such cancellation. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
outstanding Company Options.

 

(b) Each Company RSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of ( _i_ ) the Per Share Merger Consideration and ( _ii_ ) the
total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award (such amount, the "
_RSU Consideration_ ").

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the Company Disclosure Letter, at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of Shares earned for each
Company Performance Share Award granted under any Company Benefit Plan as to
which the performance period has not lapsed, but which is still outstanding,
shall be calculated by multiplying the Target Share Amount (for purpose of
this _Section 2.3(c)_, capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the applicable award agreement) by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the period starting
on the first day of the Performance Period and ending on the date of the
Change in Control and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Performance Period; _provided_ , that if the holder of such award had a
Termination of Employment due to Total Disability, Death or Retirement prior
to the date of the Change in Control, the number of Shares earned shall be
equal to the Target Share Amount. At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Share so earned shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per
Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Non-Lapsed Performance
Share Consideration_ ").

(d) Any Company Performance Share Award granted under any Company Benefit Plan
as to which the performance period has lapsed prior to, but which has not
been canceled or settled at or before, the Effective Time shall be canceled at
the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive a payment in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the number of Shares that
would otherwise be issuable under the terms and conditions of such award based
on the actual performance achieved during the applicable performance period,
and ( _ii_ ) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, collectively
with the Non-Lapsed Performance Share Consideration, the " _Performance Share
Consideration_ ").

 



7 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide optionees with
notice of their opportunity to exercise their Company Options if such notice
is required by the applicable plan or award agreement, adopt such resolutions
and take all other such actions as may reasonably be necessary in its
discretion to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, the Company
RSU Awards and the Company Performance Share Awards contemplated by this
_Section 2.3_.

(f) Any amounts contributed by participating employees through payroll
deduction in respect of the then current Offering Period under the Employee
Share Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") (for purpose of this _Section
2.3(f)_, capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the ESPP) shall be deemed applied to the purchase
of Shares on the same terms and conditions as though the Purchase Date for
such Offering Period occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time, with
any cash balance remaining in a participants account after such deemed
Purchase Date because it was less than the amount required to purchase a full
Share returned to the employee. Each participating employee shall receive a
cash payment, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration
for each such Share deemed purchased pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence (such amount, the " _ESPP Consideration_ "). As of the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause the ESPP to terminate.

(g) Each Director Annual Stock Grant outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of ( _i_ ) the Per Share Merger Consideration
and ( _ii_ ) the total number of Shares subject to such Director Annual Stock
Grant (such amount, the " _Director Annual Stock Grant Consideration_ ").

 

(h) Unless an earlier payment date is required by any provision of Law
(including to comply with the applicable provisions of Section 409A of the
Code), or unless the amounts are subject to a deferral election (and in which
case payment shall be made in accordance with such deferral election), Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Consideration, the
RSU Consideration, the Performance Share Consideration, the ESPP Consideration
and the Director Annual Stock Grant Consideration through the normal payment
processes of the Surviving Corporation within five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time and, in each case, subject to, and net of,
any and all amounts required to be withheld therefrom pursuant to Law.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering any Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions
or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting to terminate each Stock
Plan and any relevant award agreements applicable to each Stock Plan, and to
cancel any Equity Rights that are outstanding and unexercised, whether or
not vested or exercisable, at the Effective Time, subject to the right of the
holders of such Equity Rights as provided in this _Section 2.3_.

consummate the transactions contemplated herein, subject, in the case of the
Merger, to the Shareholder Approval and the filing of the Articles of Merger
and the Certificate of Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid

valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be
limited by ( _i_ ) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights

Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated herein.

 

(d) Assuming the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set

stockholder," or similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including the
provisions of Section 60.801 et seq. of the OBCA) be applicable to the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and ( _ii_ )

Letter (collectively, clauses (i) through (viii), the " _Company Approvals_
"), and other than any consent, approval, authorization, permit,
action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Shareholder Approval, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company

other transactions contemplated herein do not and will not ( _i_ ) conflict

rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or to the loss of a benefit under any loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, debenture, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement or other Contract binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right,
Loss or Lien that would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect or that may be required as a result of the

Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

Section 3.5 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

which any Company Insurance Subsidiary cedes $10,000,000 or more of premiums
annually, or has in-force ceded or assumed reserves of $100,000,000 or more
(each, a " _Reinsurance Contract_ ") is valid and binding on the applicable
Company Insurance Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except, in each case, as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity, and except where the failure to be valid, binding or in full force
and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect. None of the applicable Company Insurance
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any counterparty to any
Reinsurance Contract is (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) in
default or breach under the terms of such Reinsurance Contract, except
where such default or breach would not, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect, ( _i_ ) to the Knowledge of the Company, no counterparty under any
Reinsurance Contract is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation,
liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding
and ( _ii_ ) the financial condition of any such reinsurer is not impaired to
the extent that a default thereunder is reasonably anticipated. No written
notice of intended cancellation has been received by any Company Insurance
Subsidiary from any such reinsurer. There are no disputes under
any Reinsurance Contract, except disputes that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect, no Reinsurance Contract contains any provision providing that any
party thereto (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) may terminate,
cancel, or commute the same by reason of the consummation of the Merger.

by a prospective insured and the proposing producer knows or should know that
one or more existing life insurance policies or annuity Contracts will lapse,
or will be forfeited, surrendered, reduced in value or pledged as collateral.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect, since January 1, 2013 ( _i_ ) each

jurisdiction in which such Distributor wrote, sold or produced such business,
and no such Distributor violated any term or provision of applicable Law
relating to the writing, sale or production of such business, ( _ii_ ) no

(a) The Tax treatment of each Insurance Contract is not, and since the time of

issuance (or any subsequent modification of such Insurance

 



32  Contract) or for which such Insurance Contract would reasonably have been
expected to qualify at the time of issuance (or subsequent modification), in
each case except where the failure to have such Tax treatment would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The issuer of any Insurance Contract has no reason to believe that the
Tax treatment of any such Insurance Contract will at any time be less
favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof
than the Tax treatment either that was purported to apply in written materials

its issuance (or any subsequent modification of such Insurance Contract), or
for which any such Insurance Contract would reasonably have been expected to
qualify, at the time of issuance (or subsequent modification), except where

the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, and to comply with the
withholding and reporting requirements of the Code applicable to the Insurance
Contracts, including Sections 3405 and 6047 of the Code and Treasury

an Acquisition Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company
shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been heretofore granted to any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub under
any such provisions) or ( _E_ ) resolve, propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding
_Section 5.3(b)_, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and
prior to the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, if the Company
receives from any Person a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section
5.3_, the Company and its Representatives may, to the extent reasonably
required, contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
( _i_ ) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information (including non-public

 



50  information and data) regarding, and afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company receives from such Person (or has
received from such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-

Parent or Merger Sub and ( _ii_ ) the Company and its Representatives
may engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any

Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking any action described
in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the passage of the No-Shop Period Start
Date, until the Excluded Party End Date, the Company may continue to engage in
the activities described in  _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to any Excluded
Party, including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition Proposal
submitted by any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and
the restrictions in  _Section 5.3(b)_ and this _Section 5.3(c)_ shall not
apply with respect thereto; _provided_ that after the Excluded Party End Date,
the provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_ and this _Section 5.3(c)_ shall

propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the
foregoing actions, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), or authorize, adopt
or approve or propose to authorize, adopt or approve, an Acquisition
Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may ( _x_ ) effect a Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation) that, as a result of an Intervening
Event, failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (
_y_ ) if the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made
after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal,
authorize, adopt or approve such Superior Proposal, cause or permit the
Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition

 



51  Agreement with respect thereto and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, if, in the case of either clause (x) or (y):

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (such five (5) Business Day period, the "
_Match Period_ "), that it intends to effect a Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Change in Recommendation or
termination and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and include
complete and unredacted copies of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements relating to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any material amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal or material change in the facts or
circumstances relating to an Intervening Event (including any such amendment
or change made or occurring after the parties have amended or agreed to amend
this Agreement in accordance with clause (ii) below) shall require a new
written notice by the Company and a new Match Period (except that the
duration of any new Match Period resulting from any such amendment or change
shall be three (3) Business Days));

 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change in
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith during such Match Period
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the need for the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_; and

 

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the last Business Day of such Match Period in a manner that
would form a binding Contract if accepted by the Company and shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation) (
_x_ ) in the event the Company Boards determination pursuant to clause (d)(i)
above is in response to a Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing
by Parent were to be given effect or ( _y_ ) in the event the Company Boards
determination pursuant to clause (d)(i) above is in response to an Intervening
Event, that such changes would not affect the Company Boards determination
of the need for a Change in Recommendation in response to such Intervening
Event.

 



52 If a written notice provided by the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)(i)_
in connection with the initial Match Period or any subsequent Match Period is
delivered to Parent ( _i_ ) on a day that is not a Business Day or ( _ii_ )

the applicable Match Period shall be deemed commence at 12:01 a.m., Tokyo,

Business Day after 9:00 a.m., Tokyo, Japan time, it will promptly so notify
the Company.

third Business Day after the expiration of the initial Match Period and any
subsequent Match Period.

the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval unless this Agreement has
been terminated prior to the date of the Company Meeting, or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, in accordance with _Article VII_.

Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board from ( _i_ )
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders) or ( _ii_ )
making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company); _provided_ that neither
the Company nor the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation
except in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_. Actions permitted under this
_Section 5.3(f)_ shall not be a basis for Parent or Merger Sub to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_.

(g) Except as may relate to an Excluded Party, from and after the No-Shop
Period Start Date, as promptly as practicable after the receipt by the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, whether orally or in writing, or any
inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any

or inquiry and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, including a complete and unredacted copy of any such written
Acquisition Proposal and any material amendments or modifications thereto.

connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy
Statement. If, at any time prior to the Company Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the
Proxy Statement or the other filings shall not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or making the
other filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
( _i_ ) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and shall consider such comments in good faith, ( _ii_ )
include in such document or response all such comments reasonably proposed by
Parent with respect to any financing undertaken by Parent and the

 



54  descriptions of Parent and Merger Sub and ( _iii_ ) promptly provide Parent
with a copy of all such filings and responses made with the SEC. The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Common Stock as of
the record date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable
after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement.

 

Section 5.5 _Company Meeting_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement and to _Section 5.4_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Company
shall take all action necessary in accordance with the OBCA and its articles
of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable, subject to compliance
with the OBCA and the Exchange Act (and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder), following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ ");  _provided_
that the Company, acting in good faith after consulting with its outside legal
counsel, may postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting ( _a_ ) with the consent
of Parent, ( _b_ ) for the absence of a quorum or ( _c_ ) to allow reasonable
additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company
has determined in good faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys shareholders prior to the Company Meeting.

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with
their terms all Company Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and
agreements as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the cancellation
or settlement of any Company equity or Equity Right in the manner described
in _Section 2.3_ or requiring that any such equity or Equity Right so
canceled or settled be restored or replaced following the Effective Time,
including the ESPP. Until December 31, 2017, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each person who continues as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") ( _i_ ) base compensation and
target cash incentive bonus opportunities that are at least equal to those
that were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately before the
Effective Time, and ( _ii_ ) employee benefits (other than equity or equity-
based benefits, including the ESPP, and other than cash incentive bonus
opportunities) that are, in the aggregate, at least as favorable to those
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately before the Effective
Time by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Benefit
Plans.

 



55 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide
to each Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary without cause during the two-year
period following the Effective Time severance benefits at least equal to the
severance benefits that would have been payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) This Agreement is not intended by the Parties to ( _i_ ) constitute an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, employee benefit plan, fund or
program, ( _ii_ ) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement, or ( _iii_ ) create any obligation of the Parties with
respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any employee any benefits under any
employee benefit plan, fund or program, including severance benefits, or the
right to employment or continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates for any period by reason of this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.7 _Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate promptly the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including ( _i_ ) determining all necessary or, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent and the Company, advisable declarations,
registrations, filings or notices (" _Filings_ ") necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
Filings with Governmental Entities or third Persons), ( _ii_ ) preparing as
promptly as practicable documentation necessary to effect such Filings, (
_iii_ ) obtaining all clearances, consents, approvals, orders, waivers,
licenses or authorizations (" _Approvals_ "), including the Company Approvals
and the Parent Approvals, from any Governmental Entity or third
Person necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any such Approvals
required under applicable Insurance Laws and the HSR Act, it being understood
and agreed that "reasonable best efforts" shall be deemed to include, subject
to _Section 5.7(f)_, complying with any requirements of applicable Law or of
any Governmental Entity that may arise or be imposed in connection with such
Approvals and ( _iv_ ) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



56 (b) Subject to _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, in
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall ( _i_ ) make, or cause to be made, the Filings required of such
party (or, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Company, Filings that
are advisable to be made by such party) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable (but in no event
more than forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement), ( _ii_ )
comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information, documents or other materials (including a "second request" under

or any other Governmental Entity under any applicable Laws with respect to
such Filings and Approvals, ( _iii_ ) act in good faith and reasonably
cooperate with the other party in connection with any such Filings and
in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such
agency or other Governmental Entity under any applicable Insurance Laws, the
HSR Act or any other applicable Laws with respect to any such Filing or any
such transaction and ( _iv_ ) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act
or enter into any agreement or understanding with any Governmental Entity to
delay or not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the prior written consent of the other party.

(c) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other party
all information required by such other party for any Filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that materials may be redacted (
_i_ ) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or
any of their Subsidiaries, ( _ii_ ) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and ( _iii_ ) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Subject to applicable Laws and the requirements of
any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised
of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing each other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third Person
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the such transactions. The
Company and Parent shall each permit the other party a reasonable opportunity
to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party
in connection with, any proposed Filing or other material written
communication with any Governmental Entity and shall each provide the other
party copies of all written communications (other than communications relating
to non-substantive matters) to any Governmental Entity promptly after their
filing or submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws and the
requirements of any Governmental Entity.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking
or

 



57  Contract with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such Filings. Each of
Parent and the Company (and their respective Affiliates and Representatives)
shall not independently participate in any substantive meeting, or engage in
any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry without using reasonable best
efforts to give such other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation
and, unless prohibited by any such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend or participate in such meeting or conversation and, if so prohibited,
shall, unless prohibited by any such Governmental Entity, provide the non-
participating party a reasonably detailed summary (either written or oral) of
the material points covered in any such meeting or conversation promptly after
the conclusion thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
5.7_, Parent shall, on behalf of Parent and the Company, control and lead all
communications and strategy related to the any filings, obtaining any
necessary approvals, and resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
such agency or other Governmental Entity under any applicable Laws;
_provided_ that Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in
developing and implementing such communications and strategy.

 

(e) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.7_, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable Laws,
including Insurance Laws or the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice or waiting periods under applicable Laws,
including Insurance Laws and the HSR Act, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall limit the right of a party to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, so long as such
party has until that time complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 5.7_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.7(e)_ or anything
else in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would result in any
Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated herein, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated herein may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated herein.

 



58 Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed (all requests for consent shall be
responded to within twenty-four (24) hours) or conditioned), unless such party
determines, after consultation with legal counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in which event such party
shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement; _provided_ that ( _i_ ) the Company
shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to Parent in
connection with the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal and
matters related thereto or a Change in Recommendation and ( _ii_ ) each party
and their respective Affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case
may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiaries articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws
or similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any Action pending or asserted or

 



59  any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty
and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 5.10_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the Indemnified Parties) each current and former
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ ") to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any actual or
threatened Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any
action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or
after the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys service
as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including acts or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Partys
service as officer, director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other
entity if such services was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company); _provided_ that any Person to whom any funds are advanced pursuant
to the foregoing must, if required by Law, provide an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time. At the Companys option, the Company may
purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on
terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated herein. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further
obligation to purchase or

 



60  pay for insurance hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any one coverage
year more than three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium
expended by the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ "). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium.

(d) Parent shall cause to be paid all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
5.10_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the OBCA or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations.

Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give notice
to Parent and Merger Sub as promptly as practicable, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give notice to the Company as promptly as practicable, of ( _a_ )
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Merger, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the

 



61  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and ( _b_ ) any
Actions commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party which relate to the Merger,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein.

Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall advise Parent
promptly in writing of any Action brought by any shareholder of the Company or
any other Person against the Company or its directors or officers arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such
matter. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not control, the defense
of any such matter, shall give due consideration to Parents advice with
respect to such matter and shall not settle any such matter without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Parent shall advise the Company promptly in writing of any
Action brought by any Person against Parent or its directors or officers
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall keep the Company fully informed regarding any
such matter. Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in,
subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not control, the defense
of any such matter, shall give due consideration to the Companys advice with
respect to such matter and shall not settle any such matter without the prior
written consent of the Company if such settlement would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger.

 

Section 5.15 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability
of shareholders of Parent or the Company.

 



62 Section 5.16 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, cooperate with Parent and its Representatives and provide
all financial and other information reasonably requested by Parent from time
to time. All Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or
its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that Parent may disclose such information to Persons providing
financing to Parent (and the Representatives of such Person who reasonably
need to have access to such information) so long as such Persons and their
Representatives acknowledge and agree to be bound by the confidentiality
obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to
Representatives of Parent.

(b) The parties and their outside legal counsel shall cooperate in good faith
to develop and implement appropriate procedures to facilitate compliance by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with the covenants set forth in _Section
5.1(b)_ and Parent, upon request of the Company from time to time,
shall consult and cooperate with the Company and its outside legal advisors
in good faith to promptly determine whether actions proposed to be taken by
the Company or its Subsidiaries may be taken in compliance with such
covenants.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall discuss in good faith and cooperate with each
other with respect to such matters as the management and governance
structure, reporting matters from the Company to Parent, other post-merger
integration issues and the future business development in the United States,
among others, subject to _Section 5.11_. In furtherance of the foregoing
and without limitation thereto, Parent and the Company shall establish a
project management committee after the date of this Agreement for the purpose
of discussing in advance of the Closing governance structure and other
relevant arrangements following the Closing.

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being
satisfied on such date), then the Outside Date shall, at the election of
either the Company or Parent, be extended for an additional three (3) months;

(ii) any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued or entered an injunction or similar order, judgment, decision or
decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the

to prevent, oppose and remove such injunction or similar order, judgment,
decision or decree; or

(iii) the Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements

66 (c) by the Company, if:

 

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (
_A_ ) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ or failure of the Closing to occur and ( _B_ ) cannot be cured
by the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days
following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach;
_provided_ that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement;
or

(ii) at any time prior to the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board, when it is permitted to do so in accordance with _Section
5.3_, shall have authorized the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and, concurrently
with such termination, the Company has paid to Parent the applicable
Termination Fee.

 

(d) by Parent, if:

 

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform ( _A_ ) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section
6.3_ and ( _B_ ) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if curable, is not
cured with thirty (30) days following Parents delivery of written notice to
the Company of such breach; _provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement;

(ii) at any time prior to the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the

following the receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that has been
publicly announced or has otherwise become publicly known, the Company Board
has not publicly reaffirmed the Recommendation and fails to do so through a
press release or similar 

 



67  means within five (5) Business Days after the date Parent requests in
writing that the Company so reaffirm the Recommendation, which request may be
delivered by Parent only ( _A_ ) once with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (with the right to make an additional request with respect to each
subsequent material amendment or modification thereto) and ( _B_ ) during the
thirty (30) day period immediately prior to the date on which the Company

Section 7.2 _Manner and Effect of Termination_. In the event of any
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate and there
shall be no liability on the part of any party with respect thereto, except
that the Confidentiality Agreement, the confidentiality provisions of 
_Section 5.2(b)_ and the provisions of this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_
and _Article VIII_ shall survive such termination and remain in full force
and effect; _provided_ that no party shall be relieved or released from any
liability or damages arising from ( _a_ ) any failure to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby if required to pursuant to this
Agreement, ( _b_ ) fraud or ( _c_ ) an intentional and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement prior to such termination, and in each case the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit
of the bargain lost by Parent, or by the Company or the Companys shareholders
or holders of equity compensation awards (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including the total amount payable to such shareholders and holders
of equity compensation awards under this Agreement and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the
Company). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees
that the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3_ shall not
preclude Parent, in the case of an intentional and material breach of this
Agreement or fraud by the Company, from seeking additional damages from the
Company arising from such intentional and material breach or fraud. The
provisions of this _Section 7.2_ are not intended and shall not be construed
to provide any shareholder of the Company to assert any claim pursuant to
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "intentional and material
breach" means a material breach that is a consequence of an act (or failure to
act) undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or
constructive) that the taking of (or the failure to take) such act would, or
would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



68 Section 7.3 _Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement_.

 

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3_ if this Agreement is
terminated under the following circumstances:

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_ or _7.1(d)(iii)_ , then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee
by the second Business Day following the date of such termination;

 

(ii) if ( _A_ ) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ without a vote of the shareholders of the
Company contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Meeting having occurred
or is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_, and in either such case an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or has otherwise become publicly known, or any Person has
publicly announced or communicated an intention, whether or not conditional,
to make an Acquisition Proposal, at any time after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the date of the termination of this Agreement or the time of the
taking of the vote of the shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting,
as applicable, and ( _B_ ) within twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, the Company ( _1_ ) enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate the transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (including
any Acquisition Proposal made after the date of the termination of
this Agreement) and the acquisition contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal
is later consummated or ( _2_ ) consummates the transaction contemplated by
any Acquisition Proposal (including any Acquisition Proposal made after the
date of the termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee to Parent by the second Business Day following the date the
Company consummates such transaction; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee on the date, and
as a condition to the effectiveness, of such termination.

(b) For purposes of  _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_, all references to 15 percent in
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be 50 percent.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(i)_ without a vote of the shareholders of the Company
contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Meeting having occurred or
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ and, in either case, the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)(ii)(A)_ regarding a publicly announced, publicly
known or otherwise communicated Acquisition Proposal or intention

 



69  to make an Acquisition Proposal are applicable, then the Company shall pay
the Expense Reimbursement to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within three Business Days after delivery by Parent to the Company of a
written statement setting forth the amount thereof and attaching applicable
documentation. If, after payment of the Expense Reimbursement, the Termination
Fee subsequently becomes payable by the Company, the Termination Fee shall be
reduced by the amount of the Expense Reimbursement paid by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 7.3_ to the contrary, in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or the
Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
under this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences any Action that results in a judgment against the Company for such
amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment
of such amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of the
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in effect on the date such payment was
due, together with the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with such Action.

Section 8.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware;
_provided_ that any disputes with respect to, arising out of, relating to, or
in connection with fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board or
any other provisions herein that are required by the "internal affairs

unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it shall not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the

assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to
this Agreement, ( _i_ ) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.4_, ( _ii_ ) any claim
that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and ( _iii_ ) to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that ( _A_ ) the
Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, ( _B_ ) the venue of
such Action is improper or ( _C_ ) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties agrees
that service of process upon such party in any such Action shall be effective
if such process is given as a notice in accordance with _Section 8.7_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law. The provisions of this _Section
8.4_ are not intended and shall

Entity, other than solely for purposes of any Action initiated by the Company
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein as provided in this _Section 8.4_.

order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation and ( _ii_ ) an injunction restraining such
breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each party further agrees that ( _i_ ) it shall not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity and ( _ii_ ) no other party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.5_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar

the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written

shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of such term or

unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any
term or provision is invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify such term or provision to effect the original intent of
the parties so that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated to

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the exhibits and
schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement

 



74  constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of

whether before or after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company or the sole shareholder of the Merger Sub, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended (by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, in the case of the Company and Merger Sub) or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
_provided_ that after receipt of the Shareholder Approval or the approval of
this Agreement by the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and
regulations of NYSE require further approval of the shareholders of the
Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, as applicable, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the shareholders of the Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment to this Agreement
shall be made after the Effective Time. The failure of any party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way

Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
