ARTICLE VII 

   

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 

  

 7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Survival Date"), _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.2 and Section 2.11 hereof shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and _provided further, however_ , that if, at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the Survival Date, an Officers Certificate (as defined in Section 7.4(b)) is delivered alleging Losses and a claim for recovery under Section 7.4(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the Survival Date until such claim is fully and finally resolved. The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing, _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties of Parent and the Sub contained in Section 3.2 and Section 3.5 hereof shall terminate on the Survival Date. All covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue to remain in full force and effect in perpetuity after the Closing Date, unless they terminate earlier in accordance with their express terms. 

  

 7.2 _Indemnification_. The Escrow Participants agree severally, but not jointly, to indemnify and hold Parent and its officers, directors, and affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation (the "Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, Taxes, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable accounting and auditors fees, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation and defense, but excluding punitive, special, consequential or any multiple of damages (unless Parent has paid, or is obligated to pay, such damages in connection with a Third Party Claim) or diminution in value (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of, or with respect to or in connection with (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or, in the case of a Third Party Claim any allegation that, if true, would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy, (b) any failure by the Company to perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant or obligation applicable to it contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) the amount of any Excess Third Party Expenses, (d) the amount of any Dissenting Share Payments, (e) any and all Company Debt, to the extent such Company Debt exceeds the amount of Company Debt deducted from the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(xxxvii) ("Excess Company Debt"). The Escrow 

   ##### 

   

 

Participants shall not have any right of contribution from the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified
Party. For all purposes of this Section 7.2, any Loss of any Indemnified
Party shall be net of (A) any insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually
received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to
the right of indemnification (after accounting for any and all costs incurred
to collect such insurance or other recoveries), and (B) any specific reserves
or allowances that were included in the Required Financials; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no circumstance shall an Indemnified Party be required to
pursue proceeds under any insurance policies it maintains or any other
recoveries that may be available to such Indemnified Party from
third parties. 

   

 7.3  _Escrow Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnification Escrow Fund_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Indemnification Escrow Agent the Indemnification Escrow Amount out of Merger Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Escrow Participants pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof and shall confirm such deposit in writing with the Indemnification Escrow Agent, which notice shall confirm the Closing Date. Such deposit of the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Indemnification Escrow Fund") to be governed solely by the terms set forth herein. The cash comprising the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be deposited by Parent with respect to each Escrow Participant without any act by them, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 7.2 hereof. The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this Article VII. On or before the Closing Date the Company shall provide Parent with the maximum potential amounts payable to the Escrow Participants from the Indemnification Escrow Fund. The Indemnification Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto. Interests in the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be non-transferable. 

   

 (b) _Indemnification Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Indemnification Escrow Period_. Subject to the following requirements, the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the Survival Date (the "Indemnification Escrow Period"); _provided, however_ , that the Indemnification Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is or may be necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative prior to 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the Survival Date. As soon as the Indemnification Escrow Agent receives written notice that any such claims have been resolved in accordance with Section 7.4(d), the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims to the Escrow Participants. Deliveries of amounts out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund to the Escrow Participants pursuant 

     ##### 

  

    

to this Section 7.3(b) shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro
Rata Portions of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Fund, with the amount
of cash delivered to each Escrow Participant rounded down to the nearest
cent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, promptly following the
date on which (x) the Required Financials have been delivered to Parent by
the Company and (y) the tax matters set forth on Schedule 7.3(b) hereto have
been resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, as certified to the
Escrow Agent in writing (the "Early Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to the Escrow Participants in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portions, an aggregate amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the
Escrow Amount minus (ii) the sum of (A) any amounts paid by the Escrow Agent
to Parent from the Escrow Fund on or prior to the Early Release Date pursuant
to this Section 7.3, and (B) an amount sufficient to cover all outstanding
and unpaid indemnification claims that are subject to Officers Certificates
delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative in accordance
with the terms hereof on or before 11:59 p.m. (ET) on the Early Release Date
(whether disputed or undisputed). Immediately following the Early Release
Date, the Survival Date shall become the first anniversary of the Effective
Time. Any distribution of all or a portion of the cash in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund to the Escrow Participants shall be made by delivery of payment
by check to each such Escrow Participant equal to the amount of cash being
distributed, allocated among the Escrow Participants based on their Pro Rata
Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and mailed by first class mail
to such Escrow Participants address as set forth on the schedule delivered
to the Indemnification Escrow Agent at Closing (or to such other address as
any such Escrow Participant may have previously instructed the
Indemnification Escrow Agent in writing). Any distribution of all or a
portion of the cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund to Escrow Participants
who are Optionholders on the schedule delivered to the Indemnification Escrow
Agent at Closing shall be made by remitting such payment to Parent, and
Parent shall pay such amounts to the respective Optionholders less any
required federal and state withholding taxes, which Parent shall cause to be
paid to the applicable taxing authorities and which shall be treated for all
other purposes under this Agreement as distributed to the Optionholders. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have no liability for the actions or
omissions of, or any delay on the part of, the Parent in connection with the
foregoing. The parties hereto agree that, for tax reporting purposes, any
distribution from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to the Escrow Participants
shall be reportable on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099B for the tax year
in which the distribution is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
distributions made to the Parent on behalf of Optionholders shall be treated
as returned to the Company and shall not be reported by the Indemnification
Escrow Agent. 

   

 (c) _Protection of the Indemnification Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Indemnification Escrow Fund during the Indemnification Escrow Period and shall hold and dispose of the Indemnification Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.3(c). 

  

 (ii) The Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be invested in the Indemnification Escrow Agents Money Market Insured Savings Account (the "Money Market Account") and as described in Exhibit G hereto, and any interest paid on such cash shall be added 

   ##### 

  

 

to the Indemnification Escrow Fund and shall be a part thereof. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any investment
losses suffered absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. The parties
hereto agree that Parent is the owner of the cash in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund and that all interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned
from the investment of such cash in the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant
to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as earned by Parent. 

   

 (iii) The parties hereto agree to provide the Indemnification Escrow Agent, and the Stockholder Representative agrees to cause the Escrow Participants to provide, with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in case of non-U.S. persons) to the Indemnification Escrow Agent, immediately upon completion of the Closing. 

  

 7.4 _Indemnification Claims_. 

  

 (a) _Threshold Amount_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.4(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 7.2(a) unless and until one or more Officers Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under Section 7.2(a) in excess of $1,570,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount") has or have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnification Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.4(b) hereof, in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified without regard to the Threshold Amount from the first dollar of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (d), and (e) of Section 7.2 hereof, and (B) Losses resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 2.2 or Section 2.11 hereof. 

   

 (b) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.2, Parent shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnification Escrow Agent at any time on or before 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the Survival Date; _provided, however_ , Parent may seek indemnification for a breach of a representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.2 and Section 2.11 hereof following the expiration of the Indemnification Escrow Period by delivering an Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative on or before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Unless the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.4(c) hereof, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirty-first (31st) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party from the Indemnification Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Officers Certificate. Any payment from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to Indemnified Parties shall be made in cash, and shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Escrow Participants based on their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Indemnification Escrow Amount. For the purposes hereof, "Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (1) stating that an 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue
Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. 

   

 (c) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No payment shall be made under Section 7.4(b) if the Stockholder Representative shall object to the claim made in the Officers Certificate in a written statement labeled "Objection Notice" (an "Objection Notice"), and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to Parent and the Indemnification Escrow Agent prior to 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Officers Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Participants hereby waive the right to object to any claims in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss (as defined in Section 7.4(d)(iii) hereof). If the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with Section 7.4(b). 

   

 (d) _Resolution of Conflicts_. 

   

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c) (other than Agreed-Upon Losses as defined in Section 7.4(d)(iii) hereof), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, and such claim involves a claim against the Indemnification Escrow Fund, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to the Indemnification Escrow Agent. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by the Stockholder Representative to Parent or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to Article VII hereof, either Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, may pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law. 

  

 (iii) This Section 7.4(d) shall not apply to claims made in respect of (A) any Dissenting Share Payments (as defined in Section 1.7(c)), (B) any Excess Third Party Expenses, (C) any Excess Company Debt, or (D) any Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses (vi) and (vii) of Section 7.4(f) hereof (each, an "Agreed-Upon Loss"). Claims against the Indemnification Escrow Fund made in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 7.4(b) above. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Parent shall notify the Indemnification Escrow Agent (if the Third Party Claim is made by Parent prior to the release of the Indemnification Escrow Fund) and the Stockholder Representative in writing of such claim. If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Escrow Participants, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Participants agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of participation, that Parents legal counsel in the Third Party Claim shall not be precluded from representing Parent as against the Escrow Participants in the event that the Escrow Participants dispute the fact or amount of the Parents claim of a Loss related to such matter. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not consent to any settlement that would require indemnification by the Escrow Participants or the Stockholders without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Escrow Participants shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 7.4(e) shall not apply to any third party claim that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss. 

   

 (f) _Indemnification Escrow Agent s Duties_. 

   

 (i) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Indemnification Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or, in the reasonable opinion of Indemnification Escrow Agent, will not result in additional obligations or liabilities to the Indemnification Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Indemnification Escrow Agents duties hereunder are ministerial in nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Indemnification Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (ii) The Indemnification Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Indemnification Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, 

   ##### 

  

 

notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been
entered without jurisdiction. 

   

 (iii) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. 

  

 (iv) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Indemnification Escrow Agent. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnification Escrow Agent. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Indemnification Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Indemnification Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Indemnification Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Indemnification Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement. 

  

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Indemnification Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Indemnification Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Indemnification Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Indemnification Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Indemnification Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Indemnification Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Indemnification Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Indemnification Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Indemnification Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Escrow Participants in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount directly from the Indemnification Escrow 

   ##### 

  

 

Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be
fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability
imposed by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Indemnification Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on Indemnification Escrow Agent or incurred by Indemnification Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnification Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses"). As between Parent on the one hand and the Indemnifying Parties on the other, payment of Agent Indemnification Expenses are to be paid as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Escrow Participants in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount directly from the Indemnification Escrow Fund; _provided, however_ , that in the event the Escrow Participants portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses cannot be satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in full, the parties agree that Parent shall pay the shortfall of such Escrow Participants portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, and shall be entitled to recover such amount from each Escrow Participant equal to such Escrow Participants Pro Rata Portion of such amount without regard to any caps or other limits herein. 

  

 (viii) The Indemnification Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of New York or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent and shall remain the escrow agent until such order is received. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement. 

  

 (ix) The Indemnification Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, or in carrying out any sale of the Indemnification Escrow Fund permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Indemnification Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any provision seeking to limit the liability of the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be applicable in the event such liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnification Escrow Agent. 

  

 (xi) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Indemnification Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any of the Indemnification Escrow Fund (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be taken by the Indemnification Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be. 

  

 (xii) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, terrorism, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 

  

 (g) _Fees_. All fees (including attorneys fees) of the Indemnification Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Indemnification Escrow Agent previously delivered to Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Indemnification Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Indemnification Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Indemnification Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all out of pocket costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. 

   

 (h) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation or other entity into which the Indemnification Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Indemnification Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or other entity to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Indemnification Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Indemnification Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. 

   

 (i) _Customer Identification Program_. Each of the parties acknowledge receipt of the notice set forth on Exhibit H attached hereto and made part hereof and that information may be requested to verify their identities. 

      ##### 

  

     

 7.5 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Cornerstone IV, LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Escrow Participants to take all actions under this Agreement that are to be taken by the Stockholder Representative, including to amend this Agreement, to waive any provision of this Agreement, to negotiate payments due pursuant to this Article VII, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Indemnification Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Escrow Participant or by any such Escrow Participant against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Escrow Participant, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of at least a two-thirds interest of the Indemnification Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Indemnification Escrow Fund. In the event a vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative exists for fifteen (15) or more days, Parent shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a replacement Stockholder Representative. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Escrow Participants. 

   

 (b) The Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to the Indemnification Escrow Agent that it has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform this Agreement and to bind each of the Escrow Participants to its terms, (ii) to give and receive directions and notices hereunder and (iii) to make all determinations that may be required or that it deems appropriate under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Until notified in writing by the Stockholder Representative that it has resigned, or that it has been removed by at least two-thirds in interest of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Indemnification Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the Stockholder Representative named above and, thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor named in a writing executed by a majority-in-interest of the Indemnification Escrow Fund filed with the Indemnification Escrow Agent. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (d) The Company, the Escrow Participants and the Stockholders each hereby authorize the Stockholder Representative to: 

   

 (i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Escrow Participants or the Stockholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to receive and accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising under this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby as the Stockholder Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate;

 9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the consent of the parties hereto, other than by Parent in connection with a Parent change of control.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction, venue and such process. 

   

 9.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 9.9 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 9.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_.
