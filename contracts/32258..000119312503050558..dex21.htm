3 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 15, 2003 ("
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Lockheed Martin Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), LMC Sub One, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and The Titan
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Company_ ").



W I T N E S S E T H: 



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Company has (i) unanimously determined
that this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby are
fair to, and in the best interests of, Company and the stockholders of
Company, (ii) unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it
advisable, and (iii) unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders
of Company approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby;



WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Acquiror and Acquisition Sub
have approved the Merger on the terms set forth in this Agreement; and



WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Forward Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ ").



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows (all capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are defined for convenience of reference on Exhibit A attached
hereto):



ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER



1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), Company shall be merged with and into
Acquisition Sub and the separate existence of Company shall thereupon cease
(the " _Forward Merger_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if all
other conditions set forth in _Article 7_ have been satisfied or waived (or
are reasonably expected to be satisfied on the delivery of certificates,
opinions and instruments and documents), but the conditions in _Section
7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ have not been satisfied and the Company makes a
Company Taxable Election, then Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into
Company and the separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall thereupon cease
(the " _Reverse Merger_ "). The Forward Merger and the Reverse Merger shall
alternatively be referred to as the " _Merger_ ". Acquisition Sub (in the case
of a Forward Merger) or Company (in the case of a Reverse Merger), as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to
as " _Surviving Corporation_ ".



1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as shall be stated in the Certificate of
Merger, in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, Company and Acquisition
Sub, respectively, to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Merger Filing_ "). The Merger
Filing shall



 

1 provide for the effectiveness of the Merger immediately upon its filing. The
Merger Filing shall be made at the Closing. 



1.3 Consummation. The parties acknowledge that it is their mutual desire and
intent to consummate the Merger as soon as practicable after the date hereof.
Accordingly, the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to consummate, as
soon as practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 3.5_.



1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL.



1.5 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other actions are necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation, the title to any property or rights of Company acquired
or to be acquired by reason of, or as a result of, the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation and Company agree that the Surviving Corporation and
Company and their proper officers and directors shall and will execute and
deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and do all
things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to
such property or rights in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry
out the purpose of this Agreement, and that the proper officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized and directed in the name of
the Company or otherwise to take any and all such actions.



ARTICLE 2

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION AND ACQUIROR



2.1 Certificate of Incorporation.



(a) _Forward Merger_. If the Forward Merger is consummated, the Certificate
of Incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance
with its terms and as provided in the DGCL, except that _Article 1_ thereof
shall be amended at the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of
Section 251 of the DGCL to read in its entirety as follows: "The name of the
Corporation is The Titan Corporation (the "Corporation")."



(b)  _Reverse Merger_. If the Reverse Merger is consummated, the Certificate
of Incorporation of Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in
its entirety as set forth on Exhibit B hereto and shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and as provided in the DGCL.



2.2 By-Laws. The by-laws of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended in accordance with their terms
and as provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation
and the DGCL, except that references in the by-laws to "LMC Sub One,
Inc." shall be changed to "The Titan Corporation".



 

2 2.3 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Acquisition Sub and the officers of Company in office immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time, and thereafter such directors and
officers shall serve in accordance with the by-laws of Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



ARTICLE 3

CONVERSION OF SHARES



3.1 Merger Consideration. The manner and basis of converting the shares of
Company Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger shall be as set forth in
this _Section 3.1_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Company, Acquisition Sub or any holder of
Company Capital Stock or holder of capital stock of Acquisition Sub:



(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 3.1_ , each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding any treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub
or any Subsidiary of Acquiror or Acquisition Sub and Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The "
_Merger Consideration_ " shall mean either (i) cash in the amount of $22.00
(the " _Price Per Share_ "), without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),
(ii) the number of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common Stock_ "), rounded to the nearest four decimals
(the " _Exchange Rate_ "), equal to the Cash Consideration divided by the
Average Price (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (iii) a combination of Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration in accordance with subparagraph (c) of
this Section 3.1. The " _Average Price_ " means the average of the mean of the
high and low sales prices per share of the Acquiror Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _NYSE_ "), as reported on the Composite
Transactions Tape of the NYSE for each of the 10 consecutive full trading days
in which such shares are traded on the NYSE ending on the third trading day
prior to, but not including, the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Average Price as computed pursuant to the foregoing terms of this
sentence would (x) exceed $58.00 (subject to adjustment pursuant to  _Section
3.1(k_ )) (the " _Upper Collar_ ") then the Average Price shall be $58.00 or
(y) be less than $46.00 (subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.1(k_ ))
(the " _Lower Collar_ ") then the Average Price shall be $46.00. The Average
Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent.



(b) The number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the
right to receive Cash Consideration shall be equal to 50% of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(i)_
and the Dissenting Shares) (the " _Cash Election Number_ "). The number of
shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive
Stock Consideration shall be equal to 50% of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares to be canceled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(i)_ and the Dissenting
Shares) (the " _Stock Election Number_ ").



 

3 (c) Subject to the proration and election procedures set forth in this
_Section 3.1_ , each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding any treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror and Dissenting Shares)
shall be entitled to elect to receive (A) Cash Consideration for all such
shares (a " _Cash Election_ "), (B) Stock Consideration for all of such
shares (a " _Stock Election_ ") or (C) Cash Consideration for 50% of such
shares and Stock Consideration for 50% of such shares (a " _Combination
Election_ "). All such elections shall be made on a form designed for that
purpose prepared by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to Company (a " _Form
of Election_ "). Holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock who hold
such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "
_Representative_ ") may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such
Representative certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the shares
of Company Common Stock held by each such Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. To the extent practicable, the Form of Election shall permit
each holder that beneficially owns shares of Company Common Stock and/or whose
affiliates beneficially own shares of Company Common Stock, in more than one
name or account in the event that the aggregate of the Cash Election Shares
exceeds the Cash Election Number, to specify how to allocate the cash paid and
Acquiror Common Stock issued in the Merger among the various accounts
that such holder of Company Common Stock beneficially owns and, with the
requisite consent of such holders affiliates, among the accounts beneficially
owned by such holder and its affiliates.



(d) Acquiror and Company shall mail the Form of Election to all Persons
who are holders of Company Common Stock on the record date for the
Stockholders Meeting, on a date that is not less than 20 Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, and thereafter Acquiror and Company shall each use its
reasonable efforts to (A) mail the Form of Election to all Persons who become
holders of Company Common Stock during the period between the record date for
the Stockholders Meeting and 10:00 a.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the date
seven calendar days prior to the anticipated Effective Time and (B) make the
Form of Election available to all Persons who become holders of Company Common
Stock subsequent to such day and no later than the close of business on the
Business Day prior to the Effective Time. A Form of Election must be received
by the Exchange Agent in the manner described below no later than by the close
of business on the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") in order to be effective. All elections will be
irrevocable after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the Election
Deadline.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent hereunder
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Company Certificates and
Company Book-Entry Shares hereunder. Elections shall be made by holders of
Company Common Stock by mailing, faxing or otherwise delivering to the
Exchange Agent, in a manner acceptable to Acquiror, a Form of Election. To be
effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted
to the Exchange Agent and accompanied by the certificates representing the
shares of Company Common Stock as to which the election is being made (or by
an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates as set forth in such
Form of Election from a member of any registered national securities exchange
or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial
bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States,
provided such certificates are in fact delivered by the time set forth in such
guarantee of delivery), or in the case of Company Book Entry Shares, any
additional documentation specified in the procedures set forth in the Form



 

4 of Election. Acquiror will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole
or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have
been properly completed, signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial
defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Acquiror (or the Exchange Agent)
in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Acquiror nor the
Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect
in a Form of Election.



(f) A holder of Company Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election
which is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
shall be deemed to have made a Combination Election. If Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported Cash Election or Stock
Election was not properly made, such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall for purposes hereof be deemed to have made a Combination Election.



(g) All shares of Company Common Stock which are subject to Cash
Elections are referred to herein as " _Cash Election Shares_." All shares of
Company Common Stock which are subject to Stock Elections are referred to
herein as " _Stock Election Shares_." If, after the results of the Forms
of Election are calculated, the number of shares of Company Common Stock to
be converted into shares of Acquiror Common Stock exceeds the Stock Election
Number, the Exchange Agent shall determine the number of Stock Election Shares
which must be redesignated as Cash Election Shares in order to reduce the
number of such shares to the Stock Election Number. All holders of Stock
Election Shares shall, on a pro rata basis, have such number of Stock Election
Shares redesignated as Cash Election Shares so that the Stock Election Number
and the Cash Election Number are achieved. If, after the results of the Forms
of Election are calculated, the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be
converted into cash exceeds the Cash Election Number, the Exchange Agent
shall determine the number of Cash Election Shares which must be redesignated
as Stock Election Shares in order to reduce the amount of such cash to the
Cash Election Number. All holders of Cash Election Shares shall, on a pro
rata basis, have such number of their Cash Election Shares redesignated as
Stock Election Shares so that the Cash Election Number and Stock Election
Number are achieved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no redesignation shall be
effected for a holder who has made a Cash Election but, as a result of such
redesignation, would receive fewer than 20 shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
exchange for all of such holders shares of Company Common Stock. In this
event, the Cash Election Shares of the remaining holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be redesignated on a pro rata basis to achieve the Cash
Election Number and the Stock Election Number. Holders who make Combination
Elections will not be subject to the redesignation procedures described
herein. Acquiror or the Exchange Agent shall make all computations
contemplated by this _Section 3.1_ and all such computations shall be
conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Common Stock, absent manifest
error. 



(h) (i) After the redesignation procedure set forth in  _Section 3.1(g)_ is
completed, all Cash Election Shares and 50% of the shares of Company Common
Stock which are subject to Combination Elections shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and 50%
of the shares of Company Common Stock which are subject to Combination
Elections shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration. Such certificates previously evidencing shares of Company
Common Stock shall

 



 

5 be exchanged for (A) certificates evidencing the Stock Consideration, or (B)
the Cash Consideration, multiplied in each case by the number of shares
previously evidenced by the canceled certificate, upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.4_ , without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_.



(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.1_ , if,
after the redesignation procedure set forth in _Section 3.1(g)_ is complete,
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_
cannot be satisfied because the value of the Acquiror Common Stock is
insufficient to cause the Merger Consideration to meet the "continuity
of interest" requirement of the Treasury Regulations, but all other
conditions to Closing in _Article 7_ have been or are reasonably expected to
be satisfied, Acquiror shall be permitted to irrevocably agree to increase the
Exchange Rate to the extent necessary to permit the delivery of the tax
opinions required by _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ (but only to the
minimum extent necessary to enable such opinions to be rendered), by giving
written notice to Company (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") to consummate the Forward
Merger and increase the Exchange Rate. Any Top-Up Notice must be delivered by
Acquiror to Company no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article 7_ (other than the delivery of certificates,
opinions, and other instruments and documents). The Top-Up Notice shall
include Acquirors calculation of the increased Exchange Rate necessary to
satisfy the "continuity of interest" requirement of the Treasury Regulations
pursuant to this _Section 3.1(h)(ii)_ (assuming no further declines prior to
the Effective Time in the value of Acquiror Common Stock) and shall also
include written confirmation from the applicable counsel that, after giving
effect to the increase in the Exchange Rate (and assuming no further declines
prior to the Effective Time in the value of Acquiror Common Stock), the
opinions of counsel required by _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ can
be delivered.



(iii) If Acquiror has not delivered the Top-Up Notice within three (3)
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Article 7_ (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions,
and other instruments and documents), Company shall thereafter have three (3)
Business Days to (A) terminate this Agreement or (B) notify Acquiror that
Company will proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a
taxable basis as a Reverse Merger (the " _Company Taxable Election_ "). In
the event that Company makes a Company Taxable Election, the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ shall be deemed
waived, and, the parties agree to proceed with the Reverse Merger provided all
other conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 7_ are satisfied or waived.
__



(i) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of Company and
each share of Company Common Stock owned by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub or any
Subsidiary of Acquiror or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.



(j) All of the shares of Acquiror issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding after the
Effective Time and shall be



 

6 unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and
retired, and each holder of a Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares
will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration applicable thereto. 



(k) If, after determination of the Average Price and prior to the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall pay a dividend in, subdivide, combine into a smaller
number of shares or issue by reclassification of its shares, any shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, the Exchange Rate shall be multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
outstanding immediately after, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of such shares outstanding immediately before, the occurrence of such
event, and the resulting product shall from and after the date of such event
be the Exchange Rate, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence. If, prior to determination of the Average Price, Acquiror shall pay
a dividend in, subdivide, combine into a smaller number of shares or issue by
reclassification of its shares, any shares of Acquiror Common Stock, the Upper
Collar and the Lower Collar shall each be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
outstanding immediately before, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of such shares outstanding immediately after, the occurrence of such
event, and the resulting products shall from and after the date of such event
be the Upper Collar and the Lower Collar, as the case may be, subject to
further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.



(l) Except as set forth in the last sentence of this _Section 3.1(l)_ , at the
Effective Time all rights with respect to each outstanding option or right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ")
under any employee or director stock option or stock purchase plan or
arrangement or agreement of the Company listed on _Section 3.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") then
outstanding shall fully vest, and shall become exercisable in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Option Plans, any actions of the
Board of Directors of Company on or prior to the date hereof and the option
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and be converted into
and become rights with respect to Acquiror Common Stock, and Acquiror shall
assume each such Company Stock Option in accordance with the terms and
conditions (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), other than those
relating to vesting and exercisability, of the Company Stock Option Plan under
which it was issued and the terms and conditions, other than those relating
to vesting and exercisability, of the stock option or other agreement by which
it is evidenced. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock
Option assumed by Acquiror may be exercised solely for shares of Acquiror
Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to
each such Company Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Rate, rounding down to the
nearest whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such
Company Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
price under such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Rate and rounding up to
the nearest cent, and (iv) the term and provisions of such Company Stock
Option, other than those relating to vesting and exercisability, shall
continue in full force and effect and otherwise remain unchanged. Prior to
the Effective Time and subject to the effectiveness of the Merger, the Company
shall take all actions that may be necessary (under the plans and/or
agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Options are outstanding and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.1(l)_. This
_Section 3.1(l)_ shall not apply to the following Company Stock Option



 

7 Plans: Companys 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Companys 2000 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and Companys 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any
other plan, program or arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase
plan under Section 423 of the Code (the " _Company ESPPs_ "). The Company
ESPPs and all outstanding rights thereunder shall terminate at the Effective
Time and the offering periods thereunder shall be deemed to end on the last
NYSE trading day prior to such termination, and the rights of each
participating employee then outstanding shall be deemed to be automatically
exercised on such last NYSE trading day. On such last trading day, each
participating employee will be credited with the number of shares of Company
Common Stock purchased for his or her account(s) under the ESPPs during
such offering period. The Board of Directors of Company shall send written
notice of the Merger that will result in the termination of the ESPPs to all
participating employees not later than the time at which the Company gives
notice of the Stockholders Meeting to the Company Common Stockholders which
written notice shall include the Form of Election. No new offering periods
will be allowed to commence under the ESPPs during the period prior to the
Closing unless this Agreement has been terminated.



(m) (i) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant listed on
_Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be converted into a
warrant to acquire shares of Acquiror Common Stock as provided in this
_Section 3.1(m)_. Following the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Warrant shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the terms and
conditions of the applicable Company Warrant, except that



(x) each such Company Warrant shall be exercisable for (A) cash in the amount
of $11 per share of Company Common Stock which would have been exercisable as
of the Effective Time plus (B) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
equal to the product of 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock which would have been exercisable as of the Effective Time,
multiplied by the Exchange Rate, rounded down to the nearest whole share (the
" _Warrant Consideration_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that no fractional
shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the exercise of any
Company Warrant, and the holder of a Company Warrant otherwise entitled to
receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive, upon exercise thereof, a cash payment (without interest rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Fair Market
Value (as defined in such Company Warrant) per share of Acquiror Common Stock;



(y) the exercise price payable to receive the Warrant Consideration shall
be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such
Company Warrant at the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Rate, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent; and



(z) all references therein to the "Company" or "Common Stock" in any such
Company Warrant shall be interpreted as references to Acquiror and Acquiror
Common Stock.



(ii) The assumption of Company Warrants as provided in this _Section 3.1(m)_
shall not give the holders of such Company Warrants additional benefits or
additional (or accelerated) vesting rights that such holders did not
have immediately prior to the Effective Time



 

8 or relieve the holders of Company Warrants of any obligations or restrictions
applicable to their Company Warrants or the shares obtainable upon exercise
of Company Warrants. Except as provided above, the duration and other terms of
Company Warrants shall not change. Acquiror shall take all corporate action
reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance, at all times any Company
Warrants provided for in this _Section 3.1(m)_ are outstanding, a sufficient
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of
such Company Warrants.



3.2 Acquisition Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Acquiror as the sole stockholder of
Acquisition Sub, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Acquisition Sub (" _Acquisition Sub Common Stock_
") shall, in the case of a Forward Merger, remain outstanding as one share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Surviving Corporation, or, in the
case of a Reverse Merger, be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share of the Surviving Corporation.



3.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for
such Company Common Stock in accordance with the requirements of Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the relevant Merger Consideration and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL, unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal,
in which case such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
relevant Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section 3.1_ , without any
interest thereon. Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any demands
received by Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or documents served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by Company, and Company shall give Acquiror
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for
such Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, will
receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation and as of the Effective
Time such shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist.



3.4 Surrender and Payment.



(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of certificates
representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("
_Company Certificates_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Company Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than such holders who
properly made a Cash Election, Stock Election or Combination Election with
respect to such Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.1_ and other than Dissenting Shares), a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Company Book-Entry Shares, upon



 

9 adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates
or, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares for
payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. After the Effective Time, upon
surrender in accordance with this _Section 3.4(a)_ or in connection with a
Form of Election delivered pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ , to the Exchange
Agent of a Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares, together with
such letter of transmittal or a Form of Election pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_
, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the holder of such
Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange therefor, the
Merger Consideration to be received by the holder thereof pursuant to this
Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Company Certificates or
Company Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of Company or its
transfer agent of shares of Company Common Stock and, if Company Certificates
or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to Company for transfer, they shall
be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration. If
any Merger Consideration is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Company Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
Company or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of the Merger Consideration in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 3.4(a)_ ,
each Company Certificate and each Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by 
_Section 3.1_.



(b) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Acquiror
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share
with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be received in respect
thereof and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_ , in each case until the surrender of
such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
_Article 3_. Subject to the effect of applicable laws (including but not
limited to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws),
following surrender of any such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Share, there shall be paid to the holder of such Company Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock.



 

10 (c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article 3_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.4(d)_ ) shall
be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock so exchanged.



(d) (i) No new Company Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Company after the Merger, and (ii)
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock delivered
by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the closing price for a share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the NYSE
Composite Transactions Tape on the trading day immediately preceding the date
on which the Effective Time occurs. 



(e) At any time following the date which is nine months after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to
it any Acquiror Common Stock or funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which have been made available to the Exchange Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Company
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration. None of Acquiror, Surviving Corporation, any subsidiary or
Affiliate of Acquiror or Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for cash, shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (or dividends or distributions in respect thereof) or
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock delivered to
public officials pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws.



(f) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company
Certificate.



3.5 Closing. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall take place at the offices of King and Spalding LLP in
Washington, D.C., or such other location as shall be mutually agreeable to
Acquiror and Company on the third (3rd) Business Day (subject to the
provisions of _Section 3.1(h)(ii)_ or _Section 3.1(h)(iii)_ ) immediately
following 



 

11 the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other
than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and
documents to be delivered at the Closing, but subject to the delivery at the
Closing of such certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents) is
fulfilled or waived, or at such other time and place as Acquiror and Company
shall agree (the date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ").



3.6 Withholding. Acquiror will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former holder
of Company Common Stock all amounts required by law to be deducted or
withheld therefrom. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or
Acquisition Sub, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Acquiror or Acquisition Sub.



ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ACQUIROR AND ACQUISITION SUB



Acquiror and Acquisition Sub each represent and warrant to Company as

power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Acquiror and
Acquisition Sub is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not,
when taken together with all other such failures, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. True, accurate and complete copies
of each of Acquirors and Acquisition Subs charter documents and by-laws, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including all
amendments thereto, have heretofore been delivered to Company.



4.2 Capitalization.



(a) The authorized capital stock of Acquiror consists of 1,500,000,000 shares

value $1.00 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of Series Preferred Stock, par
value $1.00 per share. As of September 12, 2003, the only shares of capital
stock of Acquiror that are issued and outstanding are 450,997,997 shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, all of which were validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.



4.3 Authority; Non-Contravention; Approvals.

Approvals, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
This Agreement has been approved by the respective boards of directors of
Acquiror and Acquisition Sub and by Acquiror as the sole stockholder of
Acquisition Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Acquiror or
Acquisition Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Company, constitutes a valid
and legally binding agreement of Acquiror and Acquisition Sub enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) general equitable principles.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror and
Acquisition Sub do not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any
provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, or give rise to any obligation to
make payments or provide compensation under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) the
respective charters, by-laws, partnership agreements, trust declarations, or
other similar organizational instruments of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of any court or
Governmental Entity applicable to Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, concession, contract,
lease, partnership agreement, joint venture agreement or other instrument,
obligation or agreement of any kind to which Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected. The
consummation by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in any violation, conflict, breach,
termination, acceleration or creation of any Liens under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the
preceding sentence, subject (A) in the case of the terms, conditions or
provisions described in clause (ii) above, to obtaining (prior to the
Effective Time) the Acquiror Required Statutory Approvals, and (B) in the case
of the terms, conditions or provisions described in clause (iii) above, to
those consents that have been obtained as of the date of this Agreement.

apply to the terms, conditions or provisions described in clauses (ii) and
(iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph (b), and from the preceding
sentence, are such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations, payments, compensations or creations of Liens, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not 



 

13 reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror or
materially impair Acquirors ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.



(c) Except for Acquiror Required Statutory Approvals, filings with and
actions by the SEC in connection with the Form S-4, and filings with and
actions by the NYSE in connection with the listing of the Acquiror Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, no declaration, filing or registration with,
or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Acquiror or Acquisition Sub or the consummation by Acquiror or Acquisition
Sub of the transactions contemplated thereby. Excluded from the foregoing
sentence are such declarations, filings, registrations, notices,
authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or obtained, as the
case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror or materially impair
Acquirors ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



4.4 SEC Documents.



(a) Acquiror has previously delivered (except to the extent such filings
are publicly available on the EDGAR system) to Company each registration
statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than
preliminary materials) filed by Acquiror with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (" _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2002, each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof, and Acquiror has timely filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities
statutes, regulations, policies and rules since January 1, 1999 (collectively,
the " _Acquiror Reports_ "). As of their respective dates (or, if amended,
supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date so amended, supplemented or superseded), the Acquiror Reports
(i) were prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
and complied with the requirements thereof, including all of the then
applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in the Acquiror Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholders equity included in the Acquiror Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may be,
of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, in each
case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied during the periods involved, except, in the case of unaudited
statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments and as otherwise may
be noted therein.



(b) Acquiror maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that all material information concerning Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of Acquirors filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents.



 

14 4.5 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Acquiror did not have at December 31,
2002, nor, to the knowledge of Acquiror, has it incurred since that date, any
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of any nature, and there is no existing condition, situation or
circumstance that reasonably could be expected to result in such a liability
or obligation, except liabilities, obligations, contingencies, conditions,
situations or circumstances which (a) are disclosed in the Acquiror Reports,
(b) were incurred after December 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices, (c) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror or (d) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date
hereof. 



4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in or
contemplated by this Agreement or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, since
December 31, 2002, Acquiror has not suffered or experienced any Material
Adverse Effect on Acquiror.



4.7 Litigation. Other than matters existing or arising under Regulatory Laws
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are
to be dealt with as provided in _Section 6.5_ , there are no claims, suits,
actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened
against, relating to or affecting Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries before
any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
authority or any arbitrator that seek to restrain or enjoin the consummation
of the Merger. Except as set forth in the initial clause of the
preceding sentence, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any
arbitrator, which prohibits or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



4.8 Tax Treatment. Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or
agreed to take any action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance with
respect to Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.



4.9 No Acquiror Stockholders Approval Required. There is no requirement of
any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment
of any Governmental Entity (including, any exchange upon which securities of
Acquiror are publicly traded) which requires the approval or adoption by the
shareholders of Acquiror of this Agreement, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



4.10 Financial Capability. Acquiror has the financial capacity to perform and
to cause Acquisition Sub to perform all of its obligations under this
Agreement, and Acquiror has currently available all funds necessary to pay the
consideration set forth in _Article 3_ and any other amounts contemplated by

case as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto, have
heretofore been delivered to Acquiror.

permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now

Subsidiary of Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation or entity, as the case may be, and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those

Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any

voting securities or ownership interests in, any of Companys Subsidiaries.

5.4 Authority; Non-Contravention; Approval.



Except as set forth in _Section 5.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

Statutory Approvals, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Board of Directors of Company has (i) unanimously determined that this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and
in the best interests of Company and the Stockholders, (ii) unanimously
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable and (iii) unanimously
resolved to recommend that the Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and such resolutions
shall be in force and effect and neither rescinded nor superseded prior to or
as of the Closing Date. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Company
are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or,



 

18 except for the Stockholders Approval, the consummation by Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Company has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by Acquiror and Acquisition Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid
and legally binding agreement of Company enforceable against Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii)
general equitable principles.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not violate,
conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or give rise to any obligation to make payments or provide
compensation under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Company under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of (i) the respective charters, by-laws, partnership agreements,
trust declarations, or other similar organizational instruments of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of any court or
governmental authority applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets or (iii) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, concession, contract,
lease, partnership agreement, joint venture agreement or other instrument,
obligation or agreement of any kind to which Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected. The consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in any violation, conflict, breach, termination,
acceleration or creation of Liens under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence,
subject (A) in the case of the terms, conditions or provisions described in
clause (ii) above, to obtaining (prior to the Effective Time) Company Required
Statutory Approvals and the Stockholders Approval and (B) in the case of the
terms, conditions or provisions described in clause (iii) above, to obtaining
(prior to the Effective Time) consents from lessors or other third parties
that are listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Excluded from the
foregoing sentences of this paragraph (b), insofar as they apply to the
terms, conditions or provisions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the
first sentence of this paragraph (b) are such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations, payments, compensations or creations of
Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company or materially impair
Companys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



(c) Except for Company Required Statutory Approvals, no declaration,
filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or
approval of, any governmental or regulatory body or authority is necessary for
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company or the consummation by
Company of the transactions contemplated thereby. Excluded from the foregoing
sentence are such declarations, filings, registrations, notices,
authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or obtained, as the
case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company or materially impair
Companys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



 

19 (d) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Stockholders  Approval_") is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of Companys Capital Stock
necessary to approve the Merger and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



5.5 SEC Documents.



(a) Company has previously delivered (except to the extent such filings
are publicly available on the EDGAR system) to Acquiror each registration
statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than
preliminary materials) filed by Company with the SEC since January 1, 2002,
each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with
the SEC prior to the date hereof, and Company has timely filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to
relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since January
1, 1999 (collectively, the " _Company Reports_ "). As of their respective
dates (or, if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date so amended, supplemented or
superseded), the Company Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder and complied with the requirements thereof
including all of the then applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in the Company
Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Company and its
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders equity included in the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Company and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in the case of unaudited statements, for normal year-end
audit adjustments and as otherwise may be noted therein. The principal
executive officer of Company and the principal financial officer of Company
(and each former principal executive officer or principal financial officer of
Company) have made the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company
Reports filed since such certifications have been required. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



(b) Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that all material information concerning Company and
its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of Companys filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Since January 1, 1999, Company has not received
notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity that any of its
accounting policies or practices are the subject of any review, inquiry,
investigation or challenge other than comments from the SEC on Company
filings which comments have either been satisfied or withdrawn by the SEC.



 

20 (c) Company has not filed any report with the SEC or any other securities
regulatory authority or any securities exchange or other self regulatory
authority that, as of the date of this Agreement, remains confidential.



5.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in _Section 5.6_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Company did not have at December 31,
2002, nor, to the knowledge of Company, has it incurred since that date, any
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of any nature, and there is no existing condition, situation or
circumstance that reasonably could be expected to result in such a liability
or obligation, except liabilities, obligations, contingencies, conditions,
situations or circumstances which (a) are disclosed in the Company Reports,
(b) were incurred after December 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices, (c) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company
or (d) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date hereof. Company
has not been a party to any securitization transactions or "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)
at any time since January 1, 1999.



5.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in
or contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule, since
December 31, 2002, Company has not suffered or experienced any Material
Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2003, the Company has not engaged in any
material transaction of a kind or taken any action that would be prohibited
(or otherwise would require the consent of Acquiror) pursuant to _Section
6.1(a)_ , _Section 6.1(b)_ , _Section 6.1(c)_ , _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ ,
_Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ , _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ , _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ , _Section

6.1(k)_ , _Section 6.1(l)_ and _Section 6.1(n)_ with respect to the foregoing
subsections of  _Section 6.1_ if such transaction occurred after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, except for matters (a) set forth in _Section
5.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (b) disclosed in the Company
Reports.

 



5.8 Litigation



(a) Other than matters existing or arising under Regulatory Laws
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are
to be dealt with as provided in _Section 6.5_ , there are no claims, suits,
actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
against, relating to or affecting Company before any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator
that seek to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or seek other
relief or remedy and which would reasonably be expected, either alone or in
the aggregate with all such claims, actions or proceedings not otherwise
disclosed in _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company. Except as set forth in the initial clause
of the preceding sentence, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court,
governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority,
or any arbitrator, which prohibits or restricts the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which would reasonably be
expected, either alone or in the aggregate with all judgments, decrees,
injunctions, rules or orders, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company,
or which restricts the conduct of the business of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the ability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete
freely with any other Person. Except as disclosed in  _Section 5.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no



 

21 (i) material claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending against Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to the knowledge of Company, material
investigations or threatened material claims, suits, actions or proceedings
against Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(b) _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each action,
suit, investigation or proceeding pending as of the date of this Agreement
against Company or any Subsidiary of Company, or any director, officer or
employee of Company or any Subsidiary of Company alleging any violation of
federal or state securities laws, the DGCL or the rules or regulations of the
NYSE. 



5.9 No Violation of Law. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of or has been given notice or been charged with any violation of,
any law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment of any
governmental or regulatory body or authority, except for violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company and its Subsidiaries have
all permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations of and registrations with and
under all laws, and from all Governmental Entities, required by Company and
its Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as currently
conducted, except where the failure to have such permits, licenses, approvals,
authorizations and registrations, individually or in the aggregate with such
other failures not otherwise disclosed in _Section 5.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.



5.10 Compliance with Agreements. Except as set forth in _Section 5.10_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach or violation of or in default in the performance or observance of any
term or provision of, and no event has occurred which, with lapse of time
or action by a third party, could result in a default under, (a) the charter
or by-laws of Company or (b) the contracts, commitments, agreements, leases,
licenses, and other instruments of Company or its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clause (b) above, for breaches, violations and defaults which, alone
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.



5.11 Taxes.



Except as set forth in _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,



(a) Company and its Subsidiaries have (i) duly filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all Tax Returns required to be filed, and such filed
Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) duly paid
in full or made adequate provision for the payment of all Taxes for all
applicable periods and (iii) duly withheld and paid all Taxes required
by applicable law to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts
paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, or other
third party. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where any of Company or its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The liabilities and
reserves for Taxes reflected in the balance sheet included in the Company
Reports are adequate to cover all Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods ending at or prior to the date of such balance sheet and there are
no material Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of either of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due. No audit or
administrative or judicial Tax



 

22 proceeding is pending or being conducted with respect to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, a request for
information related to Tax matters, or notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed. Company has
delivered to Acquiror correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax
Returns filed for 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and for all other open years.
There are no unresolved issues of law or fact which, to the knowledge of
Company, exist or which arise out of a notice of deficiency, proposed
deficiency or assessment from the Internal Revenue Service or any other
governmental taxing authority with respect to Taxes of Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency other than waivers and
extensions which are no longer in effect. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any request for a material ruling in respect of Taxes
pending before any Governmental Entity. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement providing for the allocation or
sharing of Taxes with any entity that is not, directly or indirectly, the
Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Company. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes on gains required to be
recognized under Section 355(e) of the Code or has made any election under
Section 341(f) of the Code. Excluded from this _Section 5.11_ are any Taxes,
Tax Returns or other matters pertaining to Taxes of Company which, alone or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.



(b) Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract,
arrangement or plan that has resulted or would result, whether as a result of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Code § 280G, or (ii) any amount that will not
be fully deductible as a result of Code § 162(m).



5.12 Tax Treatment.



Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any
action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance with respect to Company or
its Subsidiaries, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



5.13 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.



(a) (1) _Section 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (A) each plan,
program, arrangement, practice and policy under which one, or more than one,
current or former officer, employee or director of Company or a Subsidiary of
Company has any right to employment, to purchase or receive any stock or other
securities of Company or a Subsidiary of Company or to receive any
compensation (whether in the form of cash or stock or otherwise) or benefits
of any kind or description whatsoever in any material amount or under which
Company or a Subsidiary of Company has any material liability and (B) each
employee benefit plan within the meaning set forth in Section 3(3) of ERISA
under which the Company or a Subsidiary has any liability.



 

23 (2) Each plan, program, arrangement, practice and policy described in Section
5.13(a)(1) shall be referred to individually as a " _Union Plan_ " and shall
be referred to collectively as the " _Union Plans_ " if described in Section
414(f) of the Code, and each other plan, program, arrangement, practice and
policy described in Section 5.13(a)(1) shall be referred to individually as a
" _Company Plan_ " and collectively as the " _Company Plans_ ".



 

(b) The Company has delivered to Acquiror (i) a current, complete and accurate
copy of each Company Plan which is set forth in writing (and any
related trust, insurance contract or other funding arrangement) and a written
summary of each Company Plan which is not set forth in writing and (ii) a copy
of the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500) and all related exhibits and
reports) for each Company Plan which is subject to ERISA.



(c) No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, and no Company Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of
Section 414(f) of the Code or a plan described in Section 413(c) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor a Subsidiary has any liability for any withdrawal or
partial withdrawal from any Union Plan and, based on information provided by
each Union Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, the Company has no reason to
believe that the either the Company or any Subsidiary would have
any liability under Title IV of ERISA to any Union Plan if the Company or a
Subsidiary incurred a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such Union Plan.



(d) There have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section
406 or Section 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to
any of the Company Plans that could result in penalties, taxes, liabilities
or indemnification obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, could
have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, and there has been no other event,
or more than one other event, with respect to any Company Plan that could
result in any liability for the Company or any Subsidiary related to any
excise Taxes under the Code or to any liabilities under ERISA which could have
a Material Adverse Effect on Company. 



(e) Each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service on the plan as currently in effect or has pending an
application for such a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
on the plan as currently in effect, and the Company is not aware of any
reason likely to result in the revocation of any favorable determination
letter which has been received or in the Internal Revenue Service declining to
issue a favorable determination letter on a pending application. The Company
has provided to Acquiror a copy of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
favorable determination letter with respect to each such Company Plan and, if
such letter does not cover a Company Plan as currently in effect, a copy of
the application to the Internal Revenue Service for such a letter.



(f) Each Company Plan has been maintained and administered in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and
all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to
ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company Plan or to the
Company or any Subsidiary as a sponsor, a plan administrator or a fiduciary of
such Company Plan. If a former Company Plan has been terminated by or all or
any part of the liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary for any current
or former Company Plan or Union Plan have been transferred to another
employer, such termination or transfer was properly



 

24 effected and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any further
liability with respect to such termination or transfer.



(g) Except as set forth in _Section 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the requisite corporate or stockholder approval of, nor the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either
alone or together with any other event, including, any termination
of employment) entitle any current or former officer, employee, director or
other independent contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary to any change in
control payment or benefit, transaction bonus or similar benefit or severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Company Plan.

Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders required to be made by applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Company nor the Board of Directors of Company shall, except as
specifically permitted by _Section 6.4(b)_ , withdraw, withhold, modify or
change any recommendation regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or approve, recommend or declare advisable
any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) providing information (pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form and on substantially
the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement and which does not prevent
Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement) to or
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person or group who has
made an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Company or all or substantially all of
the assets of Company if, with respect to such actions, (x) in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, taking into account, among
other things, the likelihood of consummation and the other terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and after receipt of advice from its
financial advisors, such Acquisition Proposal is believed to be reasonably
likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Merger (a " _Superior Proposal_ ") and (y) the Board
of Directors of Company, after receipt of advice from its outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such actions may be required by its
fiduciary obligations under Delaware law.



(c) Company agrees that it will notify Acquiror promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days of receipt) if any proposal or offer relating to or
constituting an Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Company or any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives. The notice shall be in writing and state the
identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry or engaging in
such negotiations or discussions and the material terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, Company shall keep Acquiror fully
informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within two Business Days of
receipt) of any material changes, additions or adjustments to the terms of any
such proposal or offer.



 

35 (d) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall permit Company to enter into any
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal during the term of this
Agreement, it being agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, Company
shall not enter into any agreement with any Person with respect to or that
provides for, or in any way facilitates, an Acquisition Proposal, other than
a confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section 6.3(b)_.



(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, prior to
obtaining Stockholders Approval with respect to the Merger, the Board
of Directors of Company determines, in its good faith judgment, that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Company
may terminate this Agreement (subject to Companys obligations under _Article
8_ ); provided, that



     | (i) |  | Company provides at least five business days prior
written notice to the Acquiror of its intention to terminate this Agreement in
the absence of any further action by Acquiror,  
---|---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |  | during such five business day period (or longer period
if extended by the mutual agreement of Company and Acquiror), Company agrees
to negotiate in good faith with Acquiror regarding such changes as Acquiror
may propose to the terms of this Agreement, 
---|---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |  | the Board of Directors of Company determines (after
receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel and an independent financial
advisor) that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal taking into
account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by Acquiror, and the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith
that such actions are required by its fiduciary duties under Delaware law. In
the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in this _Section
6.3(e)_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
further obligation on the part of Company, Acquiror, Acquisition Sub or
their respective officers or directors, except as provided in _Section 8.3_
and except that in the case of any such termination, _Section 6.6(b)_ ,
_Section 6.8_ and _Section 9.2_ shall survive. 
---|---|---|--- 


Nothing in this _Section 6.3(e)_ shall relieve Company from liability for any
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement.



6.4 Meeting of Company Stockholders.



(a) Subject to _Section 6.7_ hereof, Company will take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
to convene as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
a meeting (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") of the holders of Company Common
Stock (the " _Company Common Stockholders_ ") and shall submit the Merger for
approval by the Company Common Stockholders at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof.



 

36 (b) Subject to _Section 6.3_ , Company, through its Board of Directors, shall
recommend approval and adoption of the Merger by the Company Common
Stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment thereof; provided
that the Board of Directors of Company may at any time prior to receipt of the
Stockholders Approval with respect to the Merger approve, recommend and
declare advisable any Superior Proposal, if the Board of Directors of Company
determines in good faith after receipt of advice from its outside legal
counsel that such action is required by its fiduciary obligations under
Delaware law and Company terminates this Agreement as provided for in _Section
8.1(d)(iii)_.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Company shall not be required to hold
the Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated.

,  _however_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall
amend or modify any representations or warranties made herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the

under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the
termination of the Effectiveness



 

39 Period, there shall occur any event with respect to Company, Acquiror or any
of their Subsidiaries, or with respect to any information provided by Company

Company and its Subsidiaries provide such employees on the date of this
Agreement (the " _Acquiror Plans_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , in lieu thereof
Acquiror may elect to continue one or more of the Company Plans for any of
the employees for such period or periods as Acquiror may determine; and
provided further, that the employees of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
given credit for all purposes under the Acquiror Plans for their years
of service that are credited under any similar Company Plan (but only to the

and (ii) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

or described in such disclosure schedules.



(c) Neither the supplementation of the disclosure schedules pursuant to the

of its Subsidiaries covering claims made and insurable events with respect to
matters arising or omissions occurring before, on, or existing at, the

whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of _Section 6.12_ and _Section 9.11_ are intended
to benefit each person who is a beneficiary of Companys current directors
and officers insurance and indemnification policy and related arrangements,

Acquiror under _Section 6.12_ and _Section 9.11_.

all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement. Acquiror unconditionally guarantees to the Company and to each
intended beneficiary under _Section 6.12_ and _Section 9.8_ of this Agreement

obligation of Acquisition Sub (and after the Effective Time, Surviving
