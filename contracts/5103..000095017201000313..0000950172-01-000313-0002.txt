AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter
called this "AGREEMENT"), dated as of March 11, 2001, among American
General Corporation, a Texas corporation (the "COMPANY"), Prudential plc, a
public limited company incorporated in England and Wales ("PARENT"),
Holborn Delaware Partnership, a Delaware general partnership and a wholly-
owned indirect subsidiary of Parent ("HDP"), and Ascend Merger Corp., a
Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HDP ("MERGER SUB").  
RECITALS   WHEREAS, HDP and the boards of directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have each determined that it is in furtherance of
and consistent with their respective long-term business strategies and
is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies (or,
in the case of HDP, general partnership) and shareholders or general
partners, as applicable, for Parent and HDP to cause Merger Sub to merge with
and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of such combination, HDP and the
boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved
the merger (the "MERGER") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Texas Business Corporation
Act (the "TBCA"), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;   WHEREAS, it is intended that, for United States federal
income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify (i) as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"CODE") and (ii) for an exception to the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of
the Code, and that this Agreement be, and hereby is, adopted as a plan
of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code;   WHEREAS,
Parent, HDP, Merger Sub and the Company intend that the Merger be accounted
for using merger accounting methods under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United Kingdom ("U.K. GAAP");   WHEREAS, as an inducement
to the willingness of Parent, HDP and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and the Company have entered into agreements, each dated as
of the date hereof and to become effective as of the Effective Time, with
Robert M. Devlin, Frederick W. Geissinger, John A. Graf and Rodney O. Martin,
amending such individuals\' respective employment, change of control
severance and split-dollar agreements; and   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent,
HDP and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"), and the separate corporate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles
of Merger and the applicable provisions of the TBCA. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place (i) at
the offices of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, One Liberty Plaza, New
York, New York at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the fifth Business Day
after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been fulfilled or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions)
in accordance with this Agreement; provided, that, if the Closing Date would
otherwise have occurred during the ten Business Days prior to a previously
scheduled record date for any Parent dividend or distribution, the Closing
may be delayed, at the election of Parent, until the Business Day following
such record date, or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other
date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). For
purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or one on which banks are authorized by law to close in New
York, New York or London, England.   1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall file articles of merger as contemplated by the TBCA (the
"ARTICLES OF MERGER"), together with any required related certificates, with
the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, in such form as required by,
and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the TBCA.
The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of
merger by the Secretary of State of the State of Texas in response to the
filing of the Articles of Merger or at such later date and time as may be
set forth in such Articles of Merger (such time, the "EFFECTIVE TIME" and
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the "EFFECTIVE DATE").   1.4
Change in Structure. Parent may at any time prior to the Effective Time
change the structural method of effecting the combination with the Company
(including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article I and of
Article IV) if and to the extent Parent deems such change to be desirable;
provided, however, that no such change shall (i) be effected without the
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, (ii) alter or change in any way (including as to the amount or kind)
the consideration to be issued to holders of common shares, par value $.50
per share, of the Company (the "COMMON SHARES"), or the holders of any
Company Options or Company Restricted Shares as provided for in this
Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the tax treatment of holders of Common
Shares or the holders of any Company Options or Company Restricted Shares as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv)
meaningfully impede or meaningfully delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent, HDP and Merger Sub agree
that if, as a result of any such change in the structural method of effecting
the combination with the Company, any representation or warranty of the
Company would become untrue or incorrect, then such failures to be true or
correct, to the extent arising from such change in structure, shall not be
taken into account in determining whether the condition set forth in Section
7.2(a) shall have been satisfied.   ARTICLE II   ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS  OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1 The Articles
of Incorporation. The articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION"),
until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  
2.2 The Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the
"Bylaws"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
law.   ARTICLE III   OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS  OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION   3.1 Directors. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   3.2 Officers.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE IV   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON STOCK;  EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   4.1 Effect on Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any stock of
the Company or Merger Sub:   (a) Merger Consideration. Subject to Section
4.2(d), each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Common Shares held in treasury by the Company
("EXCLUDED SHARES"), (ii) Dissenting Shares, if applicable, and (iii) Common
Shares owned by Parent or the Company (in the case of the Company, other
than Excluded Shares) or any of their respective "subsidiaries" (as defined
in Section 736 of the Companies Act) if and to the extent issuance of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Common Shares would be
void pursuant to Section 23 of the Companies Act ("RETAINED Shares")) shall
be converted into, the right to receive in accordance with this Article
IV 3.6622 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") ordinary shares of Parent, of nominal
value U.K. 5p each ("PARENT ORDINARY SHARES"). Each holder of converted
and cancelled Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares,
if applicable, and Retained Shares) shall have the right to elect in
respect of any one beneficial owner to receive, in lieu of all of the
Parent Ordinary Shares such beneficial owner has the right to receive
pursuant to the prior sentence, 1.8311 American depositary shares (the
"PARENT DEPOSITARY SHARES") per Common Share, each such Parent Depositary
Share representing the right to receive two Parent Ordinary Shares (such
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares to be issued to holders
of Common Shares, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). The Parent Depositary
Shares may be evidenced by one or more American depositary receipts
("PARENT ADRS") issued in accordance with the Deposit Agreement, dated as of
June 28, 2000, among Parent, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York,
as depositary (the "DEPOSITARY"), and holders and beneficial owners from
time to time of Parent ADRs issued thereunder (as amended from time to
time, including an amendment at or prior to the Effective Time as
contemplated by Section 6.21 below, the "DEPOSIT AGREEMENT").   (b)
Cancellation of Common Shares.   (i) At the Effective Time, all Common
Shares (other than Retained Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a
"CERTIFICATE") formerly representing any of such Common Shares (other than
Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares, if applicable, and Retained Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to the Merger Consideration and
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(d) cash in lieu of
a fractional Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share, and
any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 4.2(b), in each case
without interest. The Parent Ordinary Shares and the Parent Depositary
Shares issued in accordance with this Article IV shall be of the same class
and shall have the same rights as the currently outstanding Parent
Ordinary Shares and the currently outstanding Parent Depositary
Shares, respectively. The Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all
stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and other similar Taxing Authority
charges imposed in connection with the issuance or creation of Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares constituting Merger Consideration
and any Parent ADRs in connection therewith and any deliveries thereof by
the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b)
below (including any United Kingdom stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or
other similar Taxing Authority charge (or any interest or penalties thereon)
that may be payable by the Surviving Corporation, HDP, the Exchange Agent
or Parent pursuant to the Deposit Agreement). Subject to Section
4.2(a)(iii) below, no holder of Common Shares, Company Restricted Shares or
Company Options shall be obligated to pay any fee or other charge or expense
to the Depositary or any stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax or other
similar Taxing Authority charges in connection with the issuance of any
Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent Depositary Shares or Parent ADRs pursuant to
either the Merger or the exercise of Adjusted Options and any deliveries
thereof by the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 4.2(a) and Section
4.2(b) below (for avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the provisions
of this sentence shall not apply to any subsequent (x) delivery or (y)
deposit pursuant to the Deposit Agreement).   (ii) Each Excluded Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.   (iii)
Each Retained Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be retained by the holder thereof and shall remain
outstanding as a share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;
provided, however, that at the option of Parent by written notice to the
Company prior to the Effective Time, any Retained Shares may be treated as
Excluded Shares for purposes of this Agreement.   (c) Merger Sub. At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK"), of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled.   (d) Issuance of Surviving
Corporation Shares. In consideration for HDP procuring the issuance, in
accordance with Section 4.2(a), of the Parent Ordinary Shares referred to in
Section 4.1(e), the Surviving Corporation shall issue to HDP at the Effective
Time such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation as is
equal to the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Retained Shares) with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the Common Shares, which shares shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation other than those shares remaining outstanding pursuant to Section
4.1(b)(iii).   (e) Issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares. In consideration of
the issue to HDP by the Surviving Corporation of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 4.1(d), HDP undertakes to
procure the allotment and issuance by Parent of such number of Parent
Ordinary Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares outstanding as of
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Retained Shares)
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio for the purpose of giving effect to the
delivery of the Merger Consideration referred to in Section 4.1(a).   4.2
Exchange of Certificates for Shares.   (a) Exchange Agent and Procedures.
(i) Prior to the Effective Time, HDP shall appoint Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York or, failing Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York,
another agent reasonably acceptable to the Company, as exchange agent (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT") for the purpose of acting solely as an agent in exchanging
Certificates for Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares in
accordance with this Article IV and as provided in the last sentence of
Section 4.2(b). Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of Common
Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Retained Shares) as of the Effective
Time (i) a letter of transmittal which shall require holders of Common Shares
to elect to take Merger Consideration either in the form of Parent Ordinary
Shares or Parent Depositary Shares, and which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as
the Company and Parent shall reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A)
the Merger Consideration and (B) if applicable, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares in accordance
with Section 4.2(d) and unpaid dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 4.2(b). Such letter of transmittal shall permit the
holder of record as of the Effective Time of Common Shares submitting the
same who elects to receive Parent Ordinary Shares to choose to hold such
Parent Ordinary Shares in certificated or uncertificated form. The Exchange
Agent will act solely as nominee for the holders of record of Common
Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Retained Shares) as of the Effective
Time in relation to the actions required by the Exchange Agent under
this Article IV.   (ii) Each holder of any Common Shares that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in
Section 4.1(a) shall, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x)
that whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV and (y) a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any tax withholdings required
by applicable Law) of (A) any cash in lieu of a fractional Parent
Ordinary Share or a fractional Parent Depositary Share in accordance with
Section 4.2(b), plus (B) if applicable, any unpaid dividends or
other distributions, that such holder has the right to receive in accordance
with Section 4.2(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. Subject to the receipt of a
duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal together with
delivery of a Certificate in the proper form required by the letter of
transmittal, HDP shall procure the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares to the
Depositary (or as it may direct) as and when required for the delivery of
Parent Depositary Shares in accordance with this Article IV. HDP shall
procure that the Exchange Agent requisitions from the Depositary, from time
to time, such number of Parent Depositary Shares, in such denominations as
the Exchange Agent shall specify, as are issuable in respect of Common
Shares the holders of which have elected to receive Parent Depositary Shares
and for which Certificates have been delivered to the Exchange Agent.
Subject to the receipt of a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal together with delivery of a Certificate in the proper
form required by the letter of transmittal, HDP shall procure the issuance
of Parent Ordinary Shares to each Person entitled thereto pursuant to
this Section 4.2(a)(ii), credited as fully paid, and will cause such
Person\'s name to be entered in the register of members of Parent and, except
where such Person has requested such Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued
in uncertificated form, a certificate in respect thereof shall be issued
to such Person. Where such Person has requested such Parent Ordinary Shares
to be issued in uncertificated form, Parent shall cause such Parent
Ordinary Shares to be duly issued in accordance with the instructions given
by the Person entitled thereto and in accordance with the rules of the
CREST system.   (iii) In the event of the surrender of a
Certificate representing Common Shares which are not registered in the
transfer records of the Company under the name of the Person surrendering
such Certificate, the proper number of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent
Depositary Shares, as the case may be, together with a check for any cash to
be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or
distributions in respect thereof, shall be issued or otherwise delivered
and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing
such Common Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares, as the case may be, are
to be delivered to a Person whose name is other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such delivery that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required to be paid by reason of such delivery to
a Person whose name is other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered to the extent that such Taxes are greater
than those Taxes which would have been payable by the Surviving
Corporation under Section 4.1(b)(i) had the relevant Parent Ordinary Shares
or Parent Depositary Shares been delivered to the relevant registered holder
of such Certificate or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "PERSON" shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.  
(b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Subject to the three
sentences of this Section 4.2(b), all Parent Ordinary Shares issued pursuant
to the Merger (including Parent Ordinary Shares underlying Parent Depositary
Shares) shall be entitled to all dividends or other distributions declared by
Parent in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares the record date for which is
at or after the Effective Time; provided such Parent Ordinary Shares have
been issued on or prior to such record date. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered
for exchange in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to the effect of
escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Parent Ordinary Shares or
Parent Depositary Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect
to such Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares and not paid
and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent
Depositary Shares with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with
a payment date subsequent to surrender. In furtherance of the foregoing, in
order to ensure that all holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article IV receive the dividends and
other distributions in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares described in
this Section 4.2(b), immediately prior to the record date for the first
such dividend or other distribution occurring after the Effective Time,
HDP shall procure that Parent issues to the Exchange Agent any Parent
Ordinary Shares (including Parent Ordinary Shares underlying Parent
Depositary Shares) constituting Merger Consideration not issued prior to such
record date, such Parent Ordinary Shares to be held by the Exchange Agent
as nominee for the benefit of such holders of Common Shares for exchange
in accordance with Section 4.2(a).   (c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time thereafter on the records
of the Company other than with respect to Retained Shares.   (d) Fractional
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of
a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share will be issued as Merger
Consideration and any holder of Common Shares entitled to receive a fraction
of a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share but for this Section
4.2(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which
payment shall represent such holder\'s proportionate interest in the net
proceeds (after commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including customary expenses of the Exchange Agent in
connection with such sale) from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of
all such holders of the aggregate of the fractions of Parent Ordinary Shares
and Parent Depositary Shares that would otherwise be issued (the "EXCESS
SHARES"), which sales shall be executed as soon as reasonably practicable.
The sales of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the
London Stock Exchange (the "LSE") through one or more brokers nominated by
the Parent with the pounds sterling sale proceeds being converted into US
dollars at the spot rate of exchange at the date of sale and remitted to the
Exchange Agent as soon as practicable thereafter. Until the net proceeds of
such sale have been distributed to the holders of Common Shares entitled
thereto, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders
of Common Shares entitled thereto. HDP shall procure and Parent shall issue
to the Exchange Agent (or as the Exchange Agent may request from time to
time) the Excess Shares for sale in accordance with this Section 4.2(d).  
(e) Termination of Entitlement. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the date (as notified in writing by Parent
to the Exchange Agent) on which payment in respect of such Certificates
pursuant to this Article IV would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (x) the
entitlement of the holder of such Certificate to any Merger Consideration, to
any cash payment in lieu of a fractional entitlement pursuant to Section
4.2(d), and to any dividends or other distributions of Parent pursuant to
Section 4.2(b) shall be extinguished absolutely and from that time the
Exchange Agent shall no longer act as nominee for any holder of Certificates,
and (y) upon demand by HDP, the Exchange Agent shall sell, on behalf of
Parent, any remaining Parent Ordinary Shares issued to it pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 4.2(b) and not otherwise distributed to holders of
Common Shares entitled thereto, such sales to be executed on the LSE and the
proceeds thereof remitted to HDP as soon as practicable thereafter.   (f)
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by HDP, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any
cash payable in lieu of a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent
Depositary Share, as the case may be, and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions in respect thereof pursuant to Section 4.2(b) and Section
4.2(d) upon due surrender of and deliverable in respect of the Common Shares
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement. Delivery of such
affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be deemed delivery of a
Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares for purposes of this
Article IV.   (g) Withholding Taxes. Subject to the last two sentences
of Section 4.1(b)(i), HDP, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Common Shares such amounts as HDP, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by HDP, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Common Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by HDP,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.   4.3 Dissenters\'
Rights. (a) Notwithstanding the belief of the parties that holders of Common
Shares do not have a right to dissent pursuant to Sections 5.11, 5.12 and
5.13 of the TBCA in connection with the Merger, Common Shares which are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by a holder who has filed with the Company prior to the Company
Shareholder Meeting a written objection to the Merger in compliance with
Section 5.12.A.(1)(a) of the TBCA and not voted such shares in favor of the
Merger and the plan of merger (within the meaning of the TBCA) contained in
this Agreement and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively
withdrawn such objection or otherwise waived any right such holder might have
to make a written demand for payment of the fair value of such Common Shares
("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive Merger Consideration at the Effective Time but instead shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights), if any, as are granted by
Sections 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA or as set forth below. Each holder
of Dissenting Shares who validly and timely makes a written demand on the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 5.12.A.(1)(a) of the TBCA, and who complies
with Sections 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA and does not effectively withdraw
or otherwise lose any right such holder may have to demand payment for
such Dissenting Shares shall, if it shall be determined pursuant to Section
5.12 of the TBCA that such holder is entitled to a valuation of and payment
for such Dissenting Shares, be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation the payment determined pursuant to Section 5.12 of the
TBCA. If it shall be judicially determined that any holder is not entitled to
demand payment for such Dissenting Shares, or such holder shall have
effectively withdrawn such holder\'s demand for payment for such Common
Shares (pursuant to, and with the effects set forth in, Section 5.13.C. of
the TBCA) or lost such right to appraisal and payment pursuant to Sections
5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA then, immediately upon the occurrence of such
event, such holder\'s Common Shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 4.1(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate representing such Common Shares and any cash payable in lieu of a
fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share or Parent Depositary Share, as the case
may be, and any unpaid dividends or other distributions in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 4.2(b) and 4.2(d), as applicable.   (b) The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any written objections
or demands for payment, notices or other communications received pursuant to
Sections 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA, withdrawals of such demands,
notices and communications and any other instruments relating to the Merger
served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for valuation and payment for any Common Shares under the TBCA. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as may be
required under applicable Law (in which case Parent shall be consulted),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for the valuation
and payment for Common Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawal of such demands.   (c) Any and all amounts paid
by the Surviving Corporation to holders of Dissenting Shares shall be paid by
the Surviving Corporation solely out of its own cash on hand or out of its
own borrowings. In no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates (other than
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) provide, directly or
indirectly, any funds to the Surviving Corporation in respect of payments to
holders of Dissenting Shares or the repayment of such borrowings.   4.4
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event Parent changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend (other than issuances of stock scrip in lieu of cash dividends
consistent with past practice), recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares then (a) if the record and
payment or effective dates, as the case may be, therefor shall be prior to
the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction; and
(b) if the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time but the
payment or effective date, as the case may be, therefor shall be subsequent
to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action as shall be required so
that on such payment or effective date, as the case may be, any former holder
of Common Shares who shall have received or become entitled to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article IV shall be entitled to receive
such additional Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares, as the
case may be, as such holder would have received as a result of such event if
the record date therefor had been immediately after the Effective Time. In
the event that, notwithstanding Section 6.1 hereof, the Company changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Common Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Common Shares then the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or
effective dates, as the case may be, for such transaction.   ARTICLE V  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   5.1 Standard. No representation or warranty
of the Company contained in Section 5.2 (other than those contained in
Section 5.2(b)(i) and Section 5.2(f)(i)(y)(i)) and no representation or
warranty of Parent contained in Section 5.3 (other than those contained in
Section 5.3(b)(i) and Section 5.3(f)(i)(y)(i)) shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect, and the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall not be deemed
to have breached a representation or warranty as a consequence of the
existence of any fact, event or circumstance inconsistent with such
representation or warranty, unless such fact, event or circumstance,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.2 or
Section 5.3, as applicable, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on such Person, in each case disregarding for these
purposes (x) any qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality
in any such representation or warranty and (y) any use of the terms
"material," "materially," "in all material respects" or similar terms or
phrases in any such representation or warranty. For purposes of this
Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means, with respect to a Person, a
material adverse effect on the properties, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, business or operating earnings of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or an effect which is reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of such Person
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the
extent that such adverse effect results from (i) general economic conditions
or changes therein, (ii) financial or securities market fluctuations or
conditions, (iii) changes in, or events or conditions affecting, the
financial services industry, insurance and insurance services industries,
annuity industry, consumer finance industry or asset management industry
generally, (iv) the imposition by any Governmental Entity of any condition or
requirement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (provided
that nothing in this clause (iv) shall be deemed to modify or restrict the
rights of the parties under Section 6.6(a) or 7.1(c)), or (v) Actions set
forth in Section 5.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter or Section 5.3(g) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, and, in the case of any of
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), not affecting such Person and its Subsidiaries to
a materially greater extent than it affects other Persons in industries
in which such Person competes. In determining whether the outcome of
any Action which has not become final and non-appealable, has had, or
is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, the likelihood
that such outcome will be reversed or reduced on appeal or reduced by
settlement shall be taken into account. The representations and warranties of
the Company and Parent in Section 5.2(b)(i) and Section
5.3(b)(i), respectively, shall be deemed to have been breached if they are
untrue or incorrect in any meaningful respect. The representations and
warranties of the Company and Parent in Section 5.2(f)(i)(y)(i) and
Section 5.3(f)(i)(y)(i), respectively, shall be deemed to have been breached
if they are not true and correct. It is understood that the mere inclusion
of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, as the case may be, shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
or Parent, as applicable, that such item represents a material exception
to any representation, warranty or covenant or is for any purpose relating
to this Agreement a material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it. References herein to "material," "meaningful,"
"materially," "meaningfully," "in all material respects," "in any meaningful
respect" or similar terms or phrases in respect of any Person shall apply to
such Person and members of its consolidated group taken as a whole.   5.2
Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in a
correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent
by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
LETTER"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent (it being
understood that (x) the words "to the Knowledge of the Company" or "the
Company\'s Knowledge" and any words of similar import shall mean the actual
knowledge of the Persons whose names are set forth in Section 5.2(a)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (y) the listing or setting forth of an item
in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be a
listing or setting forth in another section or sections of the Company
Disclosure Letter if and only to the extent that such information is
reasonably apparent to be so applicable to such other section or sections)
that:   (a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification.   (i) Each of
the Company and its Scheduled Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity
duly organized, validly existing and, if applicable, in good standing under

applicable, shall mean those corporations or other entities listed in Section
5.2(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Section 5.3(a)(ii) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter (which, in the case of Parent, shall include HDP and
Merger Sub), respectively. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any material lien, pledge, security interest, claim or
other encumbrance.   (ii) Other than its Scheduled Subsidiaries, the

or "commercially domiciled" and licensed to do an insurance business
for insurance regulatory purposes, and (D) indicates which Subsidiaries

or similar interests of any Person other than its Subsidiaries that are

partnership.   (b) Capital Structure. (i) The authorized stock of the
Company consists of 800,000,000 Common Shares, of which 500,510,005 Common
Shares (including shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to Company
Stock Plans) were issued and outstanding (excluding treasury shares) as of
the close of business on March 1, 2001, and 60,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.50 per share, of which no shares are issued
or outstanding as of the date hereof (the "PREFERRED SHARES"). All of
the issued and outstanding Common Shares have been duly authorized and
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the Effective
Time, there will be no Preferred Shares outstanding. As of March 1,
2001, 38,086,981 Common Shares were held in treasury by the Company. As of
the date hereof, the Company has no commitments (including contingent
or conditional commitments) to issue or deliver Common Shares or
Preferred Shares except as described in the last sentence of this Section
5.2(b) and except that, as of March 1, 2001, there were outstanding options
to purchase 34,763,370 Common Shares granted pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans to such Persons, with such exercise prices as are set forth in
a schedule previously provided to Parent and outstanding Performance
Based Restricted Stock Awards containing Performance Awards with respect
to 679,000 Common Shares and outstanding restricted share units with
respect to 770,000 Common Shares granted pursuant to Company Stock Plans,
and approximately 42,947,274 Common Shares were reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (including pursuant to such outstanding
options and other equity-based awards), but the Company is not as of the
date hereof obligated to issue such Common Shares reserved for issuance
except as set forth in this Section 5.2(b)(i) or the corresponding section of
the Company Disclosure Letter. In addition, as more fully described in
Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of February 28, 2001,
there were an estimated 920,822 phantom shares (adjusted for the March 1,
2001 stock split) under three Company deferred compensation plans which, if
all such shares vested, would be payable in Common Shares at the
applicable distribution dates.   (ii) Except as set forth above or in
Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and for changes since March
1, 2001 resulting from the exercise of stock options outstanding on such
date, as of the date hereof (i) there are no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company authorized, reserved, issued or outstanding,
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
agreement creating preemptive or other outstanding rights, subscriptions,
options, warrants, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, convertible securities or other agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to, or the value of which is determined
by reference to, the issued or unissued share capital or other ownership
interest of the Company or any of its Scheduled Subsidiaries, and (iii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement
creating any other securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or its Scheduled Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued
or outstanding. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the
Company or any such Subsidiary on any matter ("COMPANY VOTING DEBT").   (c)
Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness. The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so
contemplated (other than the approval of the Merger and the plan of merger
(within the meaning of the TBCA) contained in this Agreement by the holders
of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote in
accordance with the TBCA and the Company\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws (the "COMPANY REQUISITE VOTE"). The board of directors of the Company
has unanimously determined, as at the date of this Agreement, that it is
advisable and in the best interest of the Company\'s shareholders for the
Company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and, as of the date of
this Agreement, has recommended that the Merger and the plan of merger
contained in this Agreement be approved by the shareholders of the Company.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by HDP,
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, except that enforcement hereof may be
subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws,
now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors\' rights generally, and (ii)
the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
The Company has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley
and Co. Incorporated ("MORGAN STANLEY"), to the effect that as of the
date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to holders of Common Shares from
a financial point of view, a true and correct copy of which will be
furnished to Parent.   (d) Governmental Filings; No Violations.   (i)

Ordinary Shares are duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid
(resulting, among other things, in shareholders having no further liabilities
to Parent as a result of the ownership of such shares). As of the date
hereof, Parent has no commitments to issue Parent Ordinary Shares except
that, as of March 1, 2001, there were outstanding options and rights to
acquire 17,615,223 Parent Ordinary Shares (including options to acquire

Share Option Scheme, the Prudential plc Restricted Share Plan, the Prudential
plc Europe Management Services Sharesave Plan, the Prudential plc Share
Participation Plan, the Prudential plc Managers Share Plan and the Prudential
plc Professional Rewards Scheme (collectively, the "PARENT SHARE
SCHEMES").   (ii) Except as set forth above or as set forth in
Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and for rights or options
granted under the Parent Share Schemes or Parent Subsidiaries Share Schemes
and for changes since March 1, 2001 resulting from the exercise of options
or rights outstanding on such date, and except as expressly contemplated
by Section 6.2 below, as of the date hereof (i) there are no shares or
other voting securities of Parent reserved, issued or outstanding, (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement
creating preemptive or other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options,
warrants, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, convertible securities or other agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to, or the value of which is determined
by reference to, the issued or unissued share capital or other ownership
interest of Parent or any of its Scheduled Subsidiaries, and (iii) neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement creating any
other securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of Parent or its Scheduled Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of Parent or any such Subsidiary on
any matter ("PARENT VOTING DEBT").   (c) Corporate Authority; Approval and
Fairness. Each of Parent, HDP and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate or
partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent,
HDP and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent, HDP and Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate or partnership action, and no other corporate
or partnership proceedings on the part of Parent, HDP or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
so contemplated (other than the approval of the resolutions set forth in
the final sentence of Section 6.5(a), on a show of hands, or, on a poll by
not less than a majority or a 75% majority, as appropriate, of the holders
of the outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares who vote in person or by proxy
at the Parent Shareholder Meeting (the "PARENT REQUISITE VOTE")). HDP
has determined and the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub
has unanimously determined, as at the date of this Agreement, that,
as applicable, it is advisable and in the best interest of HDP\'s partners
and of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s shareholders for Parent, HDP and Merger
Sub, as applicable, to enter into this Agreement and for Parent, HDP and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent
has resolved to recommend that resolutions described in the last sentence
of Section 6.5(a) be approved by the shareholders of Parent. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent, HDP and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Company constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,
HDP and Merger Sub, except that enforcement hereof may be subject to or
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability
is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Parent has received
the written opinion of its financial advisor, UBS Warburg Limited, to
the effect that as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to
Parent from a financial point of view, a true and correct copy of which will
be furnished to the Company.   (d) Governmental Filings; No Violations.

or any of its Subsidiaries with, nor are any material consents,
registrations, approvals, permits applications, expiry of waiting periods or
authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent, HDP and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent,
HDP and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case, to the extent arising out of, or relating to, the
business or nature of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   (ii) Except as set
forth in Section 5.3(d)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent, HDP and Merger Sub do
not, and the consummation by Parent, HDP and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A)
a breach or violation of, or a default under, the memorandum or articles of
association or other constitutional documents of Parent or any of its (x)
Scheduled Subsidiaries and (y) as of the Closing, its other Subsidiaries, (B)
a breach or violation of, or a default under, or the creation or
acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a material lien, pledge,

its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant
to, or the creation or acceleration of any right of termination under,
any material Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets (provided, as to consummation, that the
filings, reports and notices are made, and approvals are obtained, as
referred to in Section 5.3(d)(i)) or any Law or material governmental or non-
governmental permit, registration, authorization or license to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets are subject, or (C)
any material and adverse change in the rights or obligations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries under any material Contract.   (e) Parent Reports;
Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.   (i) (A) The Registration
Statement on Form F-1 filed by Parent with the SEC on June 26, 2000 (the
"FORM F-1"), (B) each registration statement, report and accounts, proxy
statement or information statement prepared by it or its Subsidiaries, each
in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed
with the SEC thereafter or with the UKLA or the LSE after December 31, 1997
((A) and (B) collectively, including any such reports filed subsequent to the
date hereof, the "PARENT REPORTS"), and (C) the draft consolidated financial
statements of Parent included in Section 5.3(e)(i) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter (the "PARENT 2000 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") as of their respective dates,
as amended prior to the date hereof or as supplemented by Parent Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, did not, and any Parent Reports filed with
the SEC, the UKLA or the LSE subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading; provided, that Parent makes no representation or warranty with
respect to any information with respect to the Company provided to it by the
Company for inclusion in any Parent Report filed after the date hereof. Each
of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference
into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date
and each of the consolidated statements of income and of changes in
financial position included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will
fairly present, in all material respects the results of operations,
retained earnings and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments that were not, or are not reasonably expected to be,
material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with U.K. GAAP
(except in the case of unaudited statements (other than the Parent 2000
Financial Statements), as permitted by applicable rules of the SEC, or the
UKLA and the LSE, as applicable) consistently applied and, to the extent
applicable and required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, reconciled
to U.S. GAAP as noted therein during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein or in the notes thereto. The audited consolidated
financial statements of Parent prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP for the
period ended December 31, 2000 will not differ in any meaningful respect from
the Parent 2000 Financial Statements.   (ii) Except for those liabilities
that are fully reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet
of Parent included in the Parent 2000 Financial Statements or liabilities
described in the notes thereto (or liabilities for which neither accrual nor
footnote disclosure is required pursuant to U.K. GAAP), and except for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course since December 31, 2000, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due) (other than liabilities incurred in connection with the
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby).   (iii) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely filed all material periodic statements, together with
all exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and any actuarial opinions,
affirmations or certifications or other supporting documents in connection
therewith, required to be filed with or submitted to any Governmental Entity
on forms prescribed or permitted thereby (collectively, the "PARENT
REGULATORY REPORTS"). The financial statements included in the Parent
Regulatory Reports, including the notes thereto, were prepared in conformity
in all material respects with applicable statutory accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity consistently
applied for the periods covered thereby and present fairly, in all material
respects, the statutory financial position of Parent or such Subsidiary as at
the respective dates thereof and the results of operations thereof for the
respective periods then ended. The Parent Regulatory Reports complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws when filed, and no material
deficiency has been asserted with respect to any Parent Regulatory Report by
any Governmental Entity.   (iv) The achieved profits basis results of
Parent and its Subsidiaries included in Parent\'s 1999 Annual Report and the
Parent 2000 Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance in
all material respects with the Guidance. To the extent required by
the Guidance, the achieved profits basis results incorporate best
estimate forecasts of future rates of investment return, proprietor\'s
spread, policy discontinuances, mortality, expenses, expense inflation,
taxation, surrender and paid up bases, and statutory valuation bases. The
achieved profits basis results included in Parent\'s Annual Report and
Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 will not differ in any
meaningful respect from those included in Section 5.3(e)(i) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter.   (f) Absence of Certain Changes. (i) Except as disclosed
in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof or the Parent 2000
Financial Statements and (other than in the case of clause (y)(i) below)
except for actions or inactions after the date hereof as expressly
contemplated by Section 6.2 below, since December 31, 2000 (x) Parent and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course, consistent with past practice, and (y) there has not been (other than
as a result of the Merger or this Agreement) (i) any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Parent or any development or combination of
developments, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent;
(ii) any material change by Parent in accounting principles, practices or
methods other than as required by U.K. GAAP, U.S. GAAP or applicable Law or
as disclosed in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof or the
Parent 2000 Financial Statements; (iii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of the shares or
other securities of Parent, except for dividends or other distributions on
its issued share capital publicly announced prior to the date hereof; (iv)
any split in its issued share capital, reorganization, recapitalization,
or reclassification of share capital or other similar transaction or
issuance or authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect
of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its share capital; (v) other
than in the ordinary course, any material addition, or any development
involving a prospective material addition, to Parent\'s consolidated reserves
for future policy benefits or other policy claims and benefits; or (vi)
any material change in the accounting, actuarial, investment,
reserving, underwriting or claims administration policies, practices,
procedures, methods, assumptions or principles of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent not disclosed in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof or
in the Parent 2000 Financial Statements except as required by U.K. GAAP
or U.S. GAAP or applicable Law.   (ii) Except as set forth in Section
5.3(f)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, Parent has
no Knowledge that any material rating presently held by Parent or any of its
Scheduled Subsidiaries is likely to be modified, qualified, lowered or placed
under surveillance for a possible downgrade for any reason (other than any
such modification, lowering or placement resulting primarily from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).   (g) Litigation. Except
as identified by name or as summarized in reasonable detail in the Parent
Reports filed prior to the date hereof or the Parent 2000 Financial
Statements or as set forth in Section 5.3(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
to the extent provided as of December 31, 2000 in appropriately identified
reserves or, to the extent commenced or threatened after the date hereof,
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, there
are no material Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before any Governmental Entity.  
(h) Employee Benefits.   (i) The Parent Share Schemes and the Parent
Subsidiaries Share Schemes have been operated and administered in accordance
with, and are, in compliance with their terms and all applicable Laws, except
for any failures to so operate, administer or comply which have not and will
not, individually or in the aggregate, resulted or result in any
material liability or obligation of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
and all necessary material consents, approvals and licenses to operate
and administer the Parent Share Schemes and the Parent Subsidiaries
Share Schemes have been obtained.   (ii) Each of the pension schemes
referred to in Section 5.3(h)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the
"PARENT GROUP PLANS") is, to the extent that such exemption is intended by
Parent, an exempt approved scheme (or capable of such approval) within the
meaning of Chapter 1 Part XIV of the U.K. Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988. There is a contracting-out certificate in force in respect of each of
the Prudential plc Staff Scheme, the MandG; Group Pension Scheme and the
Scottish Amicable Retirement Benefit and Life Assurance Scheme. Each Parent
Group Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and/or 401(k) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service that it is so qualified and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
nothing has occurred or been done or omitted to be done since the date of
such letter that has adversely affected or will adversely affect such
qualified status. Each of the Parent Group Plans has been operated and
administered in accordance with, and is, in compliance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, except for any failures to so operate, administer or comply
which have not and will not, individually or in the aggregate, resulted or
result in any material liability for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(iii) Parent and its Subsidiaries have timely paid all contributions,
premiums and expenses payable to or in respect of each Parent Group Plan
under the terms thereof and in accordance with all applicable Laws, except
where any failure to pay such amounts in accordance with applicable Law has
not and will not, individually or in the aggregate, resulted or result in any
material liability or obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(i) Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in the Parent Reports filed
prior to the date hereof, each business of Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries has been, and is being, conducted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws. Except as set forth in the Parent Reports
filed prior to the date hereof or the Parent 2000 Financial Statements and
for regulatory examinations or reviews conducted in the ordinary course and
except as set forth in Section 5.3(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no
material investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened. Except as set forth in Section 5.3(i) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, no material change is required in Parent\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' processes, properties or procedures in connection with any
such Laws, and Parent has not received any written notice or communication of
any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of
the date hereof. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries have in place policies and procedures with respect
to themselves and their Distributors intended to assure that their sales
processes are consistent in all material respects with applicable Law
governing market practices, and, except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
filed prior to the date hereof or the Parent 2000 Financial Statements, where
there has been any material deviation therefrom, such deviation has been
cured, resolved or settled through agreements with applicable Governmental
Entities or are barred by all applicable statutes of limitations or other
equitable principles. To the Knowledge of Parent, all employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries with management responsibility with respect to any
business line, and all officers and directors thereof required to be
registered with or licensed under applicable Laws are so licensed and in good
standing with the applicable Governmental Entity.   (j) Taxes. Parent, and
each of its Subsidiaries (which, for the purposes of this Section 5.3(j)
shall include any predecessor of any Subsidiary): (A) have filed all material
Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them and (x) all such filed Tax
Returns are complete and correct in all material respects or (y) adequate
reserves have been provided for any material Taxes that could reasonably be
assessed in excess of those shown on such Tax Returns, or requests for
extensions to file such Tax Returns have been timely filed, granted and have
not expired; (B) have paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns; and
(C) as of the date hereof, have neither extended nor waived any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes and have not otherwise agreed to
any extension of time with respect to Tax assessment or deficiency. The
Parent 2000 Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes
payable by Parent and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. No material
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed by any
Taxing Authority against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that are not
adequately reserved for in accordance with U.K. GAAP or U.S. GAAP, as
applicable.   (k) Intellectual Property.   (i) Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or otherwise possesses legally enforceable
rights to use all Intellectual Property that is used in, and material to, the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and any such
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights held by Parent
and/or its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting.   (ii) Except as
disclosed in Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in
Section 5.2(k) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent does not have
Knowledge of any bona fide claims (A) to the effect that the sale, licensing
or use of any product as now used, sold or licensed or proposed for use, sale
or license by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, infringes on any copyright,
patent, trademark, trade name, service mark or trade secret; (B) against the
use by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any Intellectual Property used
in, and material to, the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted; (C) challenging the
ownership, validity or effectiveness of any of Intellectual Property owned
by, and material to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or (D) challenging
the license or legally enforceable right to use any material third-party
Intellectual Property by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.   (l) Brokers
and Finders. Except as set forth in Section 5.3(l) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, neither Parent nor any of its officers, directors or employees has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage
fees, commissions or finders\' fees in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated in this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except that Parent
has employed UBS Warburg Limited as its financial advisor pursuant to a
written agreement.   (m) Insurance Business. All actuarial reports with
respect to Parent or any Parent Insurance Company relied upon by Parent or
any Parent Insurance Company or Governmental Entity since December 31, 1998,
and all attachments, addenda, supplements and modifications thereto (the
"PARENT ACTUARIAL ANALYSES"), including those provided to the Company, were
based upon an accurate inventory of policies in force for Parent and the
Parent Insurance Companies, as the case may be, at the relevant time
of preparation, were prepared using appropriate modeling procedures
accurately applied, if relevant, and in conformity with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied, and the projections contained
therein were properly prepared in accordance with the assumptions stated
therein. The information and data furnished by Parent or any Parent Insurance
Company to its independent actuaries in connection with the preparation of
the Parent Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects.   (n)
Material Contracts. (i) Other than contracts or amendments thereto that have
been disclosed in or have been filed as an Exhibit to a Parent Report filed
prior to the date hereof or as set forth in Section 5.3(n) or Section
5.3(h)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or contracts entered into or
amendments to contracts after the date hereof as expressly permitted by
Section 6.2 below, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or otherwise bound by any Material Contract.   (ii) All of Parent\'s
Material Contracts are in full force and effect. True and complete copies of
all such Material Contracts not filed as exhibits to the Parent Reports prior
to the date hereof have been delivered or made available by Parent to the
Company. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party is in breach of or in default under any such Material
Contract. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract
containing any provision or covenant limiting in any material respect the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except as set forth in Section
5.3(n) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, to (A) sell any products or services
to any other Person, (B) engage in any line of business, or (C) compete with
any Person.   (o) Environmental Matters. (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws; (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, the properties currently owned or
operated by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including soils, groundwater,
surface water, buildings or other structures) are not contaminated with
any Hazardous Substance; (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to material liability for any
Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any property owned or
operated or formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or on any third party property or as a result of any Hazardous Substance
having been transported from any of the properties owned or operated or
formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) to the
Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any notice, demand, letter, claim or request for information from a
Governmental Entity indicating that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be
in violation of or subject to liability under any Environmental Law; and (v)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material orders,
decrees, injunctions or other arrangements with any Governmental Entity or
any material indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating to
any Environmental Law or Hazardous Substances.   (p) Merger Accounting. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent believes that no conditions exist
relating to Parent that would preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger
using merger accounting under U.K. GAAP as in effect on the date hereof.  
(q) Risk Management; Derivatives. (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have in
place risk management policies and procedures sufficient in scope and
operation to protect against risks of the type and in amounts reasonably
expected to be incurred by Persons of similar size and in similar lines of
business as Parent and its Subsidiaries.   (ii) All material derivative
instruments, including, without limitation, swaps, caps, floors and option
agreements, whether entered into for Parent\'s own account, or for the
account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered
into (A) only for purposes of mitigating identified risk or as a means of
managing Parent\'s long-term debt objectives, (B) in accordance with prudent
practices and in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies, and (C) with counterparties believed by
Parent to be financially responsible at the time; and each of them
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except that
enforcement thereof may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting
creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity)), and are in full force and effect (except to the extent
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(ii)). Neither Parent nor its
Subsidiaries, nor to Parent\'s Knowledge any other party thereto, is in
breach of any of its material obligations under any such agreement or
arrangement.   (r) Tax Status. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code or (ii) cause the stockholders of the Company, other than any
such stockholder that would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of
Parent (within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) following the Merger, to recognize gain
pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code. To the Knowledge of Parent after
due investigation, there are no facts or circumstances relating to Parent
or any Parent Affiliate, including any covenants or undertakings of
Parent pursuant to this Agreement, that would prevent Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen
and Hamilton from delivering the opinion referred to in Section 7.2(c) as
of the date hereof.   (s) Merger Sub\'s Operations. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby
and has not (i) engaged in any business activities, (ii) conducted any
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (iii) incurred any liabilities other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. HDP, as Merger Sub\'s sole stockholder, has
approved Merger Sub\'s execution of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VI  
COVENANTS   6.1 Company Interim Operations. The Company covenants
and agrees as to itself and each of its Subsidiaries that, from and after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (unless Parent shall
otherwise approve in writing and except as otherwise (i) expressly

applicable Law (it being understood that, insofar as less than 100% of the
equity of a Subsidiary of the Company is owned, directly or indirectly, by

failure would result in a violation of fiduciary duty under applicable Law)

past practice);   (b) neither it nor its Subsidiaries shall (i) except
as required to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws or comparable

and each of its Subsidiaries will not, and it shall direct and use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors, agents or other representatives (collectively, with
respect to each of the Company and Parent, such Person\'s "REPRESENTATIVES")
not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, scheme of arrangement or similar transaction involving the
Company or Parent, or any purchase (pursuant to a new issuance, tender offer,
takeover bid or otherwise) of, or offer to purchase, 20% or more of the
voting securities of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any
business that constitutes 20% or more of such Person\'s consolidated net
revenues, net income or shareholders\' funds (as reflected on the Company
2000 Financial Statements or Parent 2000 Financial Statements, as applicable)
(any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"ACQUISITION PROPOSAL"). Each of the Company and Parent further agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, have any
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, engage in any
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, or enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to it; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either the Company
or Parent or its respective board of directors from (i) making any
disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of its board
of directors, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Law, the listing rules of the NYSE, the
UKLA or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the "CITY CODE");
provided, however, that it shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
notify the other party of such obligation and the substance of the
planned disclosure as promptly as practicable (and in any event prior to
making any such disclosure); (ii) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting or
the Parent Shareholder Meeting, respectively, discussing or negotiating with
or furnishing information to any Person who has made a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal which did not, directly or
indirectly, result from or follow a breach by the Company or Parent,
respectively, of this Section 6.3(a); provided, that, unless and solely to
the extent otherwise expressly required by the U.K. Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers pursuant to the City Code (after Parent shall have used its
commercially reasonable best efforts to defeat or narrow such requirement) in
the case of Parent, no information shall be furnished to any Person unless
such Person shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, containing terms and conditions of
substantially the same effect as those of the Confidentiality Agreement; or
(iii) recommending (but only at a time that is after the fifth Business
Day following the other party\'s receipt of written notice advising such
other party that such board of directors is prepared to recommend a
Superior Proposal) such an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders, if and
only to the extent that, in the case of actions referred to in clause (ii)
or clause (iii), such Acquisition Proposal is or, in the case of clause
(ii) would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and
the board of directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable, determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure
to do so (and, in the case of clause (ii), failure to continue to do so)
would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means in respect of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, any Acquisition Proposal by a third
party (x) that would, if consummated, be more favorable than the Merger to
its shareholders, in the good faith judgment of such party\'s board
of directors, after consultation with its financial advisors, and (y)
which the board of directors of such Party determines in its good faith
judgment to constitute a transaction that is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms set forth, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. Each of the Company
or Parent agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by it or
its Representatives with any Person other than Parent or the
Company, respectively, conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Company and Parent also agrees that it will
(q) if it has not already done so, promptly request each Person, if any, that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months
prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any
potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries; (r) promptly notify all Persons with whom it has a
continuing standstill or similar agreement pursuant to which any third party
is authorized to make any Acquisition Proposal that it is withdrawing any
such authorization; and (s) take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary to enforce the provisions of any such continuing
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement.   (b) Each of the Company
and Parent agrees that it will take the necessary steps promptly to inform
its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 6.3. Each of the Company or Parent agrees that it
will notify the other promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if any
inquiries, proposals or offers relating to or constituting an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it
or any of its or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep the other
fully informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one Business Day),
of the status and material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers.
All information provided to the other party under this Section 6.3(b) shall
be kept confidential by the receiving party in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3
shall prohibit either party, to the extent applicable, from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making disclosure of the fact than
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to it has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Form
F-4, the Company Proxy Statement or the Parent Documents, to the extent
disclosure of such facts, identity or terms is advisable under applicable Law
(and the disclosure of such facts, by itself, shall not be deemed a
withdrawal or adverse modification of its approval or recommendation to
shareholders of the Merger).   6.4 Registration Statement; Parent
Documents; Information Supplied.   (a) Registration Statement. (i) Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and reasonably promptly prepare and
Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date hereof a
Registration Statement on Form F-4 (the "FORM F-4") under the Securities Act,
with respect to the issuance of the Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent
Depositary Shares in the Merger a portion of which Form F-4 shall also serve
as the Company Proxy Statement, the prospectus with respect to the Parent
Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary Shares issuable in the Merger and, so
far as appropriate, the Parent Documents. The parties will cause the Form F-4
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its respective commercially reasonable best efforts to have
the Form F-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Form
F-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 or the Company Proxy
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without providing the other
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Form F-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Depositary Shares or Parent Ordinary Shares
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Company Proxy
Statement or the Form F-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.   (ii) Each of the Company
and Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form F-4, including, without limitation the
proxy statement/prospectus constituting a part thereof (the "COMPANY PROXY
STATEMENT"), or any amendment or supplement thereto will at the time the Form
F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, at the date of mailing of the
Company Proxy Statement to shareholders and at the time or times of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in
an amendment to the Form F-4 or a supplement to the Company Proxy
Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other and, to the extent
required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the Company\'s shareholders.   (iii) Each of Parent
and the Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Documents (other than the Parent Listing Particulars) and the Company
Proxy Statement, respectively, to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.   (b) Parent Documents.
The Company and Parent shall cooperate and Parent shall reasonably promptly
prepare and file with the UKLA, a circular to be sent to Parent shareholders
in connection with the Parent Shareholder Meeting (the "PARENT CIRCULAR"),
containing (A) a notice convening the Parent Shareholder Meeting, (B) such
other information (if any) as may be required by the UKLA, and (C) such other
information as Parent reasonably determines to include therein. The Company
and Parent shall cooperate and Parent shall also prepare and file with the
UKLA listing particulars and, if required, supplementary listing
particulars, relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Parent Ordinary
Shares (the "PARENT LISTING PARTICULARS" and, together with the Parent
Circular, the "PARENT DOCUMENTS"). Each of the Company (solely to the extent
such information is provided by the Company for inclusion therein) and
Parent agrees that the Parent Documents and any supplements thereto and any
other circulars or documents issued to shareholders, employees
or debentureholders of Parent, will contain all particulars required to
comply in all material respects with all applicable United Kingdom statutory
and other legal provisions (including, without limitation, the Companies
Act, the Financial Services Act 1986 and the rules and regulations
made thereunder, and the rules and requirements of the UKLA) and all
such information contained in such documents will be substantially in
accordance with the facts and will not omit anything material likely to
affect the import of such information. The parties agree that the Parent
Listing Particulars shall contain the following statements:   "The
directors and proposed directors of Prudential plc accept  responsibility for
the information contained in this document, other  than, in the case of the
directors of Prudential plc, that relating  to the American General
Corporation Group, the directors of American  General Corporation and their

proposed directors of Prudential plc  (who have taken all reasonable care to
ensure that such is the case),  the information contained in this document
for which they accept  responsibility is in accordance with the facts and
does not omit  anything likely to affect the import of such
information."  and   "American General Corporation and the directors of
American General  Corporation accept responsibility for the information
contained in  this document relating to the American General Corporation
Group, the  directors of American General Corporation and their interests (as
set  out in parts _____ and _____ of this document) which have been

the best of the knowledge and belief of American General  Corporation and the
American General Corporation directors (who have  taken all reasonable care
to ensure that such is the case), the  information contained in this document

Meeting will provide a letter to the board of directors of Parent confirming
that to the best of the knowledge and belief of the relevant New Director
the information contained in the Parent Circular relating to the
American General Corporation Group, the directors of the Company and their
interests is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely
to affect the import of such information. The letter will not create any
legal liability between the relevant New Director or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and Parent or its affiliates.   6.5 Stockholders
Meetings.   (a) The Company will take all action reasonably necessary
to convene a meeting of the holders of Common Shares at which the holders
of Common Shares shall consider approval of the plan of merger
contained herein (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER MEETING") as promptly as
reasonably practicable (subject to applicable Law and to Section 6.5(b))
after the Form F-4 has been declared effective by the SEC. Parent will take
all action reasonably necessary to convene an extraordinary general meeting
of Parent\'s shareholders at which resolutions will be proposed to approve
the Merger and the other matters specified in the next succeeding sentence
(the "PARENT SHAREHOLDER MEETING") as promptly as practicable (but subject
to applicable Law and Section 6.5(b)) after the Parent Circular is approved
by the UKLA and the Form F-4 has been declared effective by the SEC.
Parent shall propose at the Parent Shareholder Meeting resolutions to, inter
alia (i) approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) appoint the New Directors nominated for election at the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, (iii) authorize the issue of Parent Ordinary Shares and
allotment of relevant securities, (iv) approve the continued operation of the
Company Stock Plans subject to such appropriate amendments to the rules
thereof as are required to comply with English Law, the UKLA Listing Rules
and related codes, or as set forth in Section 6.18(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, or the establishment by Parent of any new share schemes
which are substantially similar to the Company Stock Plans as at the date
hereof in which it is intended all or some of the Company\'s employees
will participate, (v) increase the maximum number of Parent directors, and
(vi) amend the articles of association of Parent to provide for the delivery
of notice of board meetings of Parent to directors outside the U.K.,
to provide for the payment of dividends in both U.K. pounds and U.S.
dollars, to provide, to the extent practicable, for the holders of Parent
Depositary Shares substantially the same rights as holders of Parent Ordinary
Shares, including with respect to the rights to requisition resolutions,
receive notice of, attend, speak and vote at, call for a poll at, require
notice of resolutions to be proposed at, examine documents made available
to shareholders at, be counted individually as present or voting with
respect, to the extent practicable, to resolutions adopted at, and to
requisition, general meetings of holders of Parent Ordinary Shares, including
by providing for the appointment of multiple proxies and sub-proxies
by certain types of shareholders, and to permit the appointment of
substitutes instead of the proxies.   (b) Parent and the Company shall each
use commercially reasonable best efforts such that, to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder
Meeting shall be held on the same day and as promptly as reasonably
practicable (subject to applicable Law) after the conditions precedent to
holding such meetings have been fulfilled. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement (including the next sentence
and the provisions of Section 6.3), the board of directors of each of Parent
and the Company shall recommend to its respective shareholders the approval
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to solicit such approval. The board of
directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable (the "WITHDRAWING PARTY"),
shall be permitted to (i) not recommend to its shareholders that they approve
the plan of merger contained herein (or the other matters to be voted on
by such shareholders as contemplated hereby) or (ii) withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to the other party (the "OTHER PARTY") its recommendation
to its shareholders that they approve the plan of merger (or the other
matters to be voted on by such shareholders as contemplated hereby) and, in
either such event, not solicit votes in favor of such approval, if such board
of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any such
withholding, withdrawal or modification, the Other Party shall have the
option, exercisable within six Business Days of notice of such
withholding, withdrawal or modification, to cause the board of directors of
the Withdrawing Party to adopt a resolution directing that the plan of
merger (and/or the other matters to be voted on by such shareholders
as contemplated hereby) be submitted without recommendation to
the shareholders of the Withdrawing Party at the relevant shareholder
meeting for the purpose of approving the plan of merger (and/or the other
matters to be voted on by such shareholders as contemplated hereby) and,
in connection with such submission, communicate the basis for
its determination that the plan of merger (and/or the other matters to be
voted on by such shareholders as contemplated hereby) be submitted to
its shareholders. If the Other Party exercises its option under the
preceding sentence to have the plan of merger (and/or the other matters to be
voted on by such shareholders as contemplated hereby) submitted to
the shareholders of the Withdrawing Party, the Other Party shall no longer
be entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.3(i) or Section
8.4(i) below, as applicable. If the Other Party fails to exercise its option
to require the Withdrawing Party to take the actions specified in the
second preceding sentence, the Withdrawing Party may terminate this Agreement
at any time after the expiration of the relevant six Business Day period.  
6.6 Filings; Other Actions; Notification.   (a) The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports, applications and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or the Company, in connection with the receipt
of any regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to (i) sell or hold
separate and agree to sell, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after
the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates
(or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, or discontinuance
or limitation by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, of any of
its assets or businesses) or (ii) agree to any conditions relating to,
or changes or restriction in, the operations of any such asset or
businesses which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), is reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to materially and adversely impact
the aggregate economic or business benefits, taken as a whole, to Parent or
the Company, as applicable, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (any such requirement specified in clause (i) or (ii), a
"BURDENSOME Condition"). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
with respect to all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in
any material filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and
as promptly as reasonably practicable.   (b) The Company and Parent each
shall, upon reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Company Proxy Statement, the Form F-4, the
Parent Documents or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c)
The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
material notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt
notice to the other of any change that, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it
or to cause the non-satisfaction of any condition to the Merger.   (d)
Prior to making any material filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information or application to or with any third
party and/or Governmental Entity (including any U.S. or non-U.S. securities
exchange and the U.K. Office of Fair Trading) in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of any U.S. or non-U.S. national
securities exchange, each party shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party with respect to (and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, give the other party an opportunity to comment on)
the content of such material filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information or application and to provide the
other party with copies of the proposed filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information or application.   (e) In the event
any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person or other legal or administrative
proceeding is commenced that questions the validity or legality of this
Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or claims damages in connection therewith, the Company and Parent
each agree to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable best efforts,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.6(a), to defend against and
respond thereto.   (f) Unless either of the parties shall have
reasonably determined in good faith based upon a written withdrawal of, or a
failure to receive, the accountants letters referred to in Section 7.1(f)
below (or receipt of written notification that either of such letters will
not be received) that merger accounting treatment under U.K. GAAP will not
be appropriate (an "ACCOUNTING DETERMINATION"), the Company Proxy
Statement and the Parent Documents will contain pro forma financial
information based upon such treatment. In the event that either of the
parties makes an Accounting Determination, as promptly as practicable
following such Accounting Determination the parties shall, if required by
applicable Law, (i) prepare and file with the SEC or the UKLA and the LSE, as
applicable, and (ii) mail to shareholders of the Company and/or Parent,
amended, supplemented or new documents containing pro forma financial
information prepared in accordance with accounting methods determined to
be appropriate. If, prior to the preparation and mailing of such revised
or new documents, the shareholders of Parent or the Company have
already approved the Merger, Parent and/or the Company, as applicable, shall
hold a new meeting which for all purposes of this agreement shall be deemed
the Parent Shareholder Meeting or the Company Shareholder Meeting,
as applicable, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
as if the prior meeting had not been held.   (g) Nothing set forth in this
Section 6.6 shall be deemed to limit or affect the right of any party to take
any action expressly permitted pursuant to Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3
hereof.   6.7 Access. Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, each party agrees that it shall (and
shall, only to the extent appropriate in the case of Subsidiaries that are
not wholly owned, cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other\'s
officers, directors or Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its and
its Subsidiaries\' properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, shall (and shall, only to the extent appropriate in the case
of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish reasonably promptly to the other all information concerning its and
its Subsidiaries\' business, properties and personnel as may reasonably
be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section
6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by such party hereunder and provided, further, that the foregoing shall
not require either party to permit any inspection, or to disclose
any information, that in the reasonable judgment of such party would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of
its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the party shall have
used commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to a senior executive officer
of the relevant party or such Person as may be designated by such
officers. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, including all such information disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter.   6.8
Affiliates. Not later than the fifteenth day prior to the mailing of the
Company Proxy Statement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names
and addresses of those Persons who are or are expected to be, to the
Knowledge of the Company, as of the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
"affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. There shall be added to such lists the names and addresses of
any other Person subsequently identified by the Company as a Person who may
be deemed to be such an affiliate; provided, however, that no such Person
identified by the Company shall remain on such list of affiliates if Parent
shall receive from the Company, on or before the date of the Company
Shareholder Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent
to the effect that such Person is not such an affiliate. The Company shall
exercise its commercially reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Parent, prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
from each such affiliate identified in the list delivered pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 6.8 (as the same may be supplemented as
aforesaid) a letter dated as of the Company Shareholder Meeting substantially
in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "AFFILIATE LETTERS"). Parent shall not
be required to maintain the effectiveness of the Form F-4 or any other
registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares received in the Merger by
such affiliates and the Parent ADRs representing Parent Depositary Shares
received by such affiliates shall bear a customary legend regarding
applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section
6.8.   6.9 Listing Application. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to
the UKLA a listing application and to the LSE an application for admission to
trading with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares, and to the NYSE a listing
application in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary
Shares issuable in the Merger or, as necessary, upon exercise of Adjusted
Options, and shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain,
prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Ordinary
Shares, in the case of the UKLA and LSE, and such Parent Ordinary Shares and
Parent Depositary Shares in the case of the NYSE, subject to official notice
of issuance. The Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the Common Shares to be de-listed from the NYSE, the
PSE, the SWX, the UKLA and the LSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.   6.10 Publicity. The
initial press release concerning the Merger shall be a joint press release
and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall provide each other the opportunity to review, comment
upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable best efforts to agree
upon, and shall not issue, any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation, except as either party may determine
is required by applicable Law (including the City Code), court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange
(including the LSE and the UKLA).   6.11 Expenses. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Exchange Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in Article
IV out of assets held by the Company prior to the Merger. Parent and its
affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) will not provide,
directly or indirectly, any funding for the payment of such amounts. Except
as otherwise provided in Sections 4.1(b)(i), 6.24 and 8.5, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that
filing fees and other expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing,
mailing and distributing the Form F-4, the Company Proxy Statement, the
Parent Documents and related documents shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company.   6.12 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\'
Insurance.   (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall to
the extent permitted by Law cause the Surviving Corporation to and shall in
any event permit the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless (and Parent shall take no action to prevent the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries from so indemnifying, defending
and holding harmless) the present and former directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "COSTS")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions by them in their capacities as employees,
agents, officers or directors of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or
taken by them at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that
the Company or the relevant Subsidiary is permitted to indemnify its
directors and officers under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation,
and its articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) as in effect on the date hereof (and the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of current or former employees, agents, directors or officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
organizational documents and indemnification agreements or arrangements
heretofore entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who become employees, agents, directors or officers of Parent or
its Subsidiaries to be entitled to the same indemnity and exculpation rights
and protections as are afforded to similarly situated employees, agents,
directors and officers of Parent or its Subsidiaries, it being understood
that executive officers and directors of the Company shall be deemed
similarly situated to executive officers and directors of Parent.   (b) For
a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide that portion of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance with respect to claims against such Indemnified Parties
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions which occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than two hundred percent (200%) of the
amount expended by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT")
to maintain or procure such directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
coverage immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided, that such
coverage immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be for the same
coverage and amounts as in effect on the date of this Agreement); provided,
further, that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain or obtain
the insurance called for by this Section 6.12(b), the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance
Amount; provided, further, that officers and directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide reasonable and
customary representations and warranties to the relevant insurance carriers
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance; provided, further, that any
substitution or replacement of existing policies shall not result in any gaps
or lapses in coverage with respect to facts, events, acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.   (c) For a period of three
years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall to the extent permitted by Law cause the Surviving Corporation to and
shall in any event permit the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless (and Parent shall take no action to prevent the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries from so indemnifying, defending and holding
harmless) the New Directors (the "INDEMNIFIED DIRECTORS") against all Costs
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions by them in their capacities as directors
of Parent occurring at or after the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest
extent that the Surviving Corporation is permitted to indemnify its directors
under the Laws of State of Texas and its articles of incorporation and bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof (and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law), and (ii) provide directors\' liability insurance (under a policy
separate from the coverage described in Section 6.12(b) above; provided that
the amount required in the aggregate to be spent by the Surviving
Corporation under both such policies shall not exceed the Insurance Amount)
with respect to claims against such Indemnified Directors arising from
facts, events, acts or omissions which occurred at or after the Effective
Time, which insurance shall, when taken together with any directors\'
liability insurance available to such Indemnified Directors from Parent,
contain at the least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the
Company; provided, however, that any substitution or replacement of
existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage that
result in a failure to meet the standard in clause (ii) above with respect to
facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or after the Effective
Time.   (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.12(a) or Indemnified Director wishing to claim indemnification
under Section 6.12(c), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation described above, shall promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation thereof; provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.12(a) or Section
6.12(c) unless and to the extent such failure materially increases the
Surviving Corporation\'s liability under such subsection (a) or subsection
(c).   (e) It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties
and Indemnified Directors to whom this Section 6.12 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.12. The provisions of this
Section 6.12 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Director, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Director may have by contract
or otherwise.   (f) In the event that either of the Surviving Corporation
or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person (whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise), then,
and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, will
assume the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.12.   (g) Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any successor or assign thereto to
comply with its obligations under this Section 6.12.   6.13 Takeover
Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company and its board of directors shall, to the fullest extent consistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.   6.14 Board of Directors of
Parent. At the Effective Time, the board of directors of Parent shall consist
of up to 18 directors. The board of directors of Parent shall take action
necessary to ensure that six directors of the Company as of the date hereof
selected by mutual agreement of the Company and Parent (such Company director
designees, the "NEW DIRECTORS") shall be nominated for election as directors
of Parent by Parent shareholders at the Parent Shareholder Meeting with
effect from and subject to the Effective Time and that in default of the
election of any New Director at such meeting, an alternative New Director
selected by mutual agreement of the Company and Parent be appointed a
director of the Parent by resolution of the board of directors of Parent
after the Parent Shareholders Meeting and prior to the Effective Time. The
appointment terms of each of the New Directors will, in any case, be such as
to ensure that as equal a number of New Directors as practicable retire by
rotation at each of the three annual general meetings of Parent shareholders
following the Effective Time.   6.15 Accountants\' Letters. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause to
be delivered to the other party, a letter of Ernst and Young LLP and KPMG Audit
plc, respectively, independent auditors, dated (i) the date on which the
Form F-4 shall become effective and (ii) a date shortly prior to the
Effective Date, and addressed to such other party, in form and substance
customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent accountants in
accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 72.   6.16
Integration Committee. Parent recognizes that the Company has a talented
group of officers and employees that will be important to the future growth
of the combined companies. In recognition of the foregoing, promptly after
the date hereof, the parties will establish an integration committee composed
of senior executive officers of both Parent and the Company, as mutually
selected by Parent\'s and the Company\'s Chief Executive Officers, which will
have direct access to Parent\'s Chief Executive Officer and will be
responsible for proposing alternatives and recommendations to him regarding
the matters and issues arising in connection with the integration of the two
companies and their respective businesses, assets and organizations.   6.17
Tax-Free Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts, and each agrees to cooperate with the other and
provide the other with such documentation, information and materials as may
be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to (i) cause the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 7.2(c) and
7.3(b), (ii) avoid gain recognition to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, and (iii) enable the Company and
Parent to obtain a ruling from the IRS prior to the Closing Date to the
effect that the Merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code
(the "U.S. TAX RULING"). The Company and Parent each agrees to consult with
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, with respect to the request for
the U.S. Tax Ruling. Prior to submitting any written submissions or
representations to the IRS in connection with such request, the Company and
Parent, as the case may be, each agrees to provide such written submissions
and representations to the other party for such other party\'s review and
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Neither Parent
nor the Company will take or fail to take (and, following the Merger, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to not take or fail to take) any action
which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or would reasonably be expected to impede or preclude the
IRS\'s issuance of the U.S. Tax Ruling prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to the Merger, Parent will (and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) file all required information with its Tax Returns and maintain all
records required for Tax purposes, including, without limitation, the
reporting requirements contained in United States Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(6).   6.18 Employee Benefits.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each option to purchase Common Shares granted to employees
or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company\'s
1999 Stock and Incentive Plan, the Company\'s 1997 Stock and Incentive Plan,
the Company\'s 1984 Stock and Incentive Plan as restated February 8, 1994
(sometimes called the Company\'s "1994 STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN"), the
Western National Corporation 1993 Stock and Incentive Plan, the US LIFE
Corporation 1981 Stock Option Plan, the US LIFE Corporation 1991 Stock Option
Plan or the US LIFE Corporation Non-Employee Directors\' Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK PLANS") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "COMPANY OPTIONS") shall be
converted into an option (an "ADJUSTED OPTION") to purchase the greatest
number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares that is equal to the number of Common
Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price (denominated in pounds
sterling) per Parent Ordinary Share (rounded to the nearest whole penny)
equal to the exercise price for each such Common Share subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio, and all references in each such Company Option to the Company
(other than any references relating to a "Change in Control" of the Company)
shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where appropriate; provided, however,
that (x) the adjustments provided herein with respect to any Company Options
which qualify as "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of
the Code) or which are described in Section 423 of the Code, shall be
effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code and (y) the exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share covered by an
Adjusted Option shall not be less than the nominal value of such share.
Parent Ordinary Shares subject to Adjusted Options may, at the election of
the holder of the Adjusted Option, be in the form of Parent Depositary
Shares evidenced by Parent ADRs, and the exercise price of such Adjusted
Options shall be denominated in U.S. dollars. Parent and the Company
acknowledge that each Company Option shall be fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case in accordance with its
terms in effect as of the date hereof (except that, in the case of each
Company Option which is granted in accordance with the terms in effect as of
the date hereof of a reload feature of a Company Option outstanding as of
the date hereof, such vesting and exercisability shall be in accordance
with the terms on the date of grant of the reload Company Option).   (b) As
of the Effective Time, each restricted Common Share, restricted share unit
and Common Share that is represented by the Performance Award portion of a
"Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award" granted to any employee or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a Company Stock Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "COMPANY RESTRICTED SHARES") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 4.1
of this Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to such conversion and
subject to any necessary consents from the holders of Company Restricted
Shares upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to the Company
Restricted Shares, the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Company Restricted Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions under the Code, or
any applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. As of
the Effective Time, each incentive award granted to a non-employee director
of the Company under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "INCENTIVE AWARD
UNITS") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be deemed to be invested in the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 4.1 above until the termination of such
director\'s service on the board of directors of the Company and, thereafter,
shall be deemed to be invested or distributed to such director in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, any payment election
duly made by such director and any related grant document issued in
connection with such Incentive Award Units that has been previously provided
to Parent.   (c) Subject to the approvals of Parent\'s shareholders
referred to in Section 6.5(a)(iii) and (iv), (i) as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume the obligations of the Company under the Company Stock
Plans, except that Parent may make minor alterations required to comply
with applicable English law, the UKLA Listing Rules and related codes which
are not anticipated to adversely affect the economic interests of the
holders of awards thereunder and may make any other alteration required to
comply with applicable English law, the UKLA Listing Rules and related codes
which is described in Section 6.18(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
with respect to the Adjusted Options and the Incentive Award Units and (ii)
from and after the Effective Time, the terms of each Company Option,
Incentive Award Unit and the Company Stock Plan under which such Company
Option or Incentive Award Unit, as the case may be, was initially granted, in
each case, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
continue to apply to the corresponding Adjusted Option or Incentive Award
Unit, subject to the alterations described herein and except as
specifically provided otherwise in this Section 6.18.   (d) Except as set
forth in Section 6.18(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Company and
Parent agree that each of the Company Stock Plans shall be amended, (i) if
and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the conversion
of Company Options and Incentive Award Units pursuant to paragraphs (a) and
(b) above and the substitution of Parent for the Company thereunder to the
extent applicable to effectuate the assumption of such plans by Parent, in
particular so that Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall have all
authority and control over the Company Stock Plans subject to Section 6.18(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) to preclude any automatic grants of
awards thereunder on or after the date hereof, other than grants of
"reload options" solely in accordance with the terms of the Company Options
as in effect on the date hereof, and (iii) to preclude the grant of any
options or other awards thereunder on or after the date hereof that provide
for or permit the grant of "reload options". The Company and Parent further
agree that the Company, prior to the Effective Time, shall take all
action necessary or appropriate to terminate all reload features in all
Company Options as of the Effective Time.   (e) Parent shall (i) take all
action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a
sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares for delivery upon exercise of all
Adjusted Options and (ii) issue or cause to be issued or transfer or cause to
be transferred the appropriate number of Parent Ordinary Shares (which may,
at the election of the recipient, be in the form of Parent Depositary Shares)
upon the exercise or maturation of rights existing under the Adjusted
Options. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form F-8 (or other appropriate form)
registering a number of Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent Depositary Shares
necessary to fulfill Parent\'s obligations under this Section 6.18. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such registration
statement to remain effective (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus required thereby) for at least as long as Adjusted Options are
outstanding.   (f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate
notices setting forth (i) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares and, if
applicable, Parent Depositary Shares, subject to the Adjusted Options held by
such holder, (ii) the exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share subject to
the Adjusted Options, and (iii) an acknowledgement that all such
Adjusted Options and all Incentive Award Units will continue to be governed
by the terms and conditions governing the corresponding Company Option
or Incentive Award Unit as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except as provided in this Section 6.18.   (g) Except as set forth in
Section 6.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with the terms thereof in effect as of
the date hereof or as amended after the date hereof with the prior written
consent of Parent, each employment agreement, change in control severance
agreement, split dollar agreement and supplemental executive retirement
agreement (including any amendments thereto listed or described in Section
6.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter) between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any present or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is listed or described in Section
6.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent and the Company acknowledge
that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "Change in Control"
for all purposes of the Company Plans.   (h) During the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent
shall provide (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to provide) employees (other than any employees to whom a collective
bargaining agreement applies) of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
Effective Time (such non-union employees being hereinafter called the
"CONTINUING EMPLOYEES"), during the period of their respective employment
with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its
Subsidiaries, with benefits under employee benefit plans that are
substantially similar in the aggregate (excluding Parent-stock-based
benefits) to the aggregate benefits (excluding Company-stock-based benefits)
provided to the Continuing Employees under the terms of the Company Plans as
of the date hereof. From and after the Effective Time, to the extent required
by the terms of the applicable Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assure
that no amendment or termination of any Company Plan shall reduce the
benefits accrued or benefit distribution elections made by any participant
thereunder without the participant\'s consent. During the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary (and the third
anniversary in the case of the Company\'s Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan) thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to maintain and honor, in accordance with the terms thereof in
effect as of the date hereof or as amended by the Company after the date
hereof with the prior written consent of Parent (as applied only to
Continuing Employees), the Company\'s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan,
Restoration of Retirement Income Plan, Supplemental Thrift Plan and Severance
Plan.   (i) Except as set forth in Section 6.18(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, for purposes of any Plan maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent (collectively,
the "PARENT PLANS"), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize (or cause to be recognized)
the service of a Continuing Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any predecessor entities completed prior to the Effective Time (and
any other service credited by the Company under corresponding Company
Plans previously provided to Parent and as described in Section 5.2(h)(vi) of
the Company Disclosure Letter and additional service which, as set forth
in Section 6.18(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company is
obligated to credit with respect to actual service rendered after the
Effective Date) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate in and
calculation of any severance or vacation entitlement under those Parent Plans
in which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant after the Effective
Time to the extent that such service was recognized by the Company and
its Subsidiaries under the corresponding Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be credited to the
extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same periods of service.   (j) From and after the Effective Time, if any
Continuing Employee becomes a participant in a Plan of Parent that is a
medical, dental or other health plan, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-
existing condition limitations applicable to the Continuing Employee that
were covered under the Company Plan in which the Continuing Employee was
a participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in
such Plan of Parent and credit any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
that are applicable to the Continuing Employee and are incurred by
the Continuing Employee and his or her beneficiaries during the portion of
the calendar year prior to his or her commencement of participation in
such Plan of Parent.   (k) The provisions of this Section 6.18 shall not
create in any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries any rights to employment or continued employment with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.   (l) Prior to or within fourteen business days
following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall amend the Benefit
Trust Agreement made as of February 8, 2001 between the Company and The
Chase Manhattan Bank and take all other actions necessary or appropriate
to eliminate any requirement thereunder that any funds, assets or
other property be deposited in or otherwise transferred to the trust under
such Benefit Trust Agreement to fund any obligations thereunder or for any
other purpose; provided, however, such funding shall be required in
connection with a "change in control" of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(each as defined in Section 6.18(l) of the Company Disclosure Letter) after
the Merger.   (m) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to
cause a new "date of exercise," within the meaning of the Company\'s 1998
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated effective as of
November 2, 2000 (the "COMPANY STOCK PURCHASE PLAN"), to be established that
will cause the option period under such Company Stock Purchase Plan in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date to terminate as of a date that
is no later than three business days prior to the Effective Date;
provided that such change in the option period shall be conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger. On such new date of exercise in accordance
with exercise made by the participant, the Company shall apply the
funds credited as of such date under the Company Stock Purchase Plan within
each participant\'s payroll deductions account to the purchase of whole
Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase
Plan. Any amount remaining in each participant\'s payroll deductions account
shall be refunded to the participant. Immediately prior to and effective as
of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, the
Company shall terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan.   6.19 Section 16
Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Common Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Common Shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by Article I, Article IV or Section 6.18
of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January
12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.  
6.20 Coordination of Dividends. Subject to the provisions of Section
6.1(b)(iii)(C) and Section 6.2(b)(iii)(C), as applicable, from the date of
this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of Parent and the Company shall
continue to pay cash dividends on the Parent Ordinary Shares and Common
Shares, as applicable, in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not less than 15 days prior to the date which
the parties reasonably agree in good faith is the anticipated Closing Date
taking into account, if applicable, the proviso to Section 1.2 (the
"ESTIMATED CLOSING DATE"), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, declare a cash dividend (the "EQUALIZATION DIVIDEND") on the
Common Shares in an amount per share equal to the Dividend Differential, such
dividend to be payable to holders of record of Common Shares on a record date
not less than three days prior to the Closing Date and such dividend to be
paid at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of
this Agreement, "DIVIDEND DIFFERENTIAL" shall mean the excess (calculated in
US dollars), if any, of (x) the aggregate amount of the cash dividends per
share that a holder of a Common Share would have received (or been entitled
to receive upon the occurrence of the relevant payment date whether or not
such date falls before, on or after the Estimated Closing Date) had the
Effective Date been the date of this Agreement and such holder received the
Merger Consideration in respect of such share in the form of Parent
Ordinary Shares (rounding to the nearest Pound .01) on the date of this
Agreement and held such Merger Consideration until the Estimated Closing
Date, over (y) the aggregate amount of the cash dividends per share that a
holder of a Common Share would have received (or been entitled to receive
upon the occurrence of the relevant payment date whether or not such date
falls before, on or after the Estimated Closing Date) had such holder held
such Common Share from the date of this Agreement until the Estimated
Closing Date (without taking account of the Equalization Dividend). For
purposes of calculating the Dividend Differential, each dividend paid by
Parent on Parent Ordinary Shares which was denominated in pounds sterling
shall be converted into equivalent US dollar amounts using the spot rate of
exchange (as published in The Wall Street Journal (National Edition) or, if
not reported therein, such other generally-recognized authoritative source
as is mutually acceptable to the parties) on the date such dividend was
paid by Parent (or if such dividend has not yet been paid on the last
Business Day preceding the date of declaration of the Equalization Dividend,
and rounded to the nearest $.01) and no interest on any amount shall be
deemed paid or accrued. When calculating the Dividend Differential it shall
be assumed that the amount of a cash dividend per share in each of (x)
and (y), above, is the amount of such cash dividend prior to any
withholding Tax being levied and exclusive of any applicable United Kingdom
Tax credit. The Equalization Dividend shall be paid exclusively from the
assets held by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Merger and shall
not be funded, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any of its
affiliates. Following determination of the Estimated Closing Date, Parent and
the Company shall not declare any dividend on the Common Shares and
Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable (other than (1) the Equalization
Dividend and (2) any Parent dividend which by agreement of the parties has
been taken into account in calculating the Dividend Differential as if
the record date shall have already occurred but which has not yet been
declared by Parent but is anticipated to be declared with a record date prior
to the Effective Time), which dividend has a record date prior to the
Effective Date.   6.21 Deposit Agreement and Shareholder Meetings.   (a)
Parent shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, enter into an amendment to
the Deposit Agreement with the Depositary to (i) require that Parent deliver
to the Depositary for mailing, and if so delivered, the Depositary shall mail
or cause to be mailed, to the registered holders of Parent Depositary Shares
any reports mailed or otherwise distributed to holders of Parent Ordinary
Shares, (ii) allow holders of Parent Depositary Shares to instruct the
Depositary to vote its Parent Depositary Shares in a particular fashion, and
(iii) give effect, to the extent necessary, to the amendments to Parent\'s
articles of association described in Section 6.5(a)(vi) above. The form and
substance of this amendment shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall allow holders of Parent Depositary
Shares to participate in rights offerings on the same terms as holders of
Parent Ordinary Shares.   (b) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall study
and consider whether to adopt procedures after the Effective Time to enable
United States holders of Parent Depositary Shares to attend and, at the
invitation of the Chairman, speak (but not vote) by means of video
conference, conference telephone or other similar communications equipment,
at any shareholder meeting of Parent held in the United Kingdom.   6.22
Merger Accounting. From and after the date hereof and until the Effective
Time, except as required by applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of Article VI, none of Parent, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall, and each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause other affiliates over which
they exercise control not to, knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to
take any action, that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the ability of
Parent to account for the Merger using merger accounting under the Companies
Act and U.K. GAAP.   6.23 Qualification of the Fund Clients; Fund Client
Boards. Subject to applicable fiduciary duties to the Fund Clients, the
Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Fund
Clients not to take action (i) that would prevent any Fund Client from
qualifying as a "regulated investment company," within the meaning of section
851 of the Code, or (ii) that would be inconsistent with any Fund Client\'s
prospectus and other offering, advertising and marketing materials.   6.24
Transfer Taxes. All stamp, transfer, or documentary taxes or other Taxes
payable by the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement in connection with
the Merger or the issuance of the Merger Consideration (including, without
limitation, all amounts described in the last two sentences of Section
4.1(b)(i) above) shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation exclusively out
of assets held by the Company prior to the Merger. Parent and its affiliates
will not provide, directly or indirectly, any funding for the payment of any
such amounts.   6.25 Parent Allotment Resolution. Parent shall, at the
Closing, deliver a resolution duly passed by the board of directors of Parent
and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, allotting (subject to
the receipt of duly completed and validly executed letters of
transmittal together with Certificate(s) in the proper form required by the
letter of transmittal) all Parent Ordinary Shares which are required to be
allotted pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and Section 6.18 of this Agreement.  
6.26 Report and Valuation. Unless Parent and the Company agree otherwise,
Parent shall procure that each Person to whom Parent Ordinary Shares are to
be allotted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall receive a copy
of a valuation report in accordance with the requirements of Section 103 of
the Companies Act prior to such allotment being made.   6.27 Dividend
Reinvestment Plan. From and after the date hereof, the Company will satisfy
its obligations under the Company\'s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan only with Common Shares acquired in open market purchases and not with
Common Shares held in treasury.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS   7.1

to (i) prevent the entry of any such Order or (ii) defend against and
reasonably promptly appeal any such Orders or penalties that may be entered
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by reason of the non-
satisfaction of this Section 7.1(d).   (e) Form F-4. The Form F-4 shall

Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to the Company shall have
occurred and this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(iii) as a result of an intentional breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then the Company shall pay
to Parent a termination payment equal to $600,000,000 (the "COMPANY
TERMINATION AMOUNT"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Such
Company Termination Amount shall be paid promptly and, in any event, within
two Business Days after the date of such termination.   (b) In the event
that:   (i) a Pre-Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to
the Company shall have occurred and this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.4(i) (which clause relates to the board of directors of
the Company withdrawing or modifying its recommendation of the Merger);  
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(ii)(A)
(which clause relates to a breach under the "no solicitation" or related
obligations under Section 6.3);   (iii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(ii)(B) by reason of the Company or the board
of directors of the Company recommending an Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders pursuant to clause (iii) of the proviso to Section 6.3(a);
or   (iv) a Pre-Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to the
Company shall have occurred and this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(iv);   then, in any such event, (A) the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such
termination, pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
initial termination payment equal to three-fifths (3/5) of the Company
Termination Amount, and (B) if, prior to or within nine (9) months following
any such termination, (x) the Company executes and delivers an agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (y) the board of directors of the
Company recommends a third-party tender offer or exchange offer for the
Common Shares, or (z) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
is consummated, then, upon the occurrence of the first such event described
in clause (x), (y) or (z) (a "POST-TERMINATION COMPANY ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL EVENT"), the Company shall also promptly (and in any event within
two Business Days after such event) pay Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an additional amount equal to two-fifths (2/5)
of the Company Termination Amount.   (c) In the event that a Pre-
Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to the Company shall have
occurred and this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.2(iii) (which clause relates to failure to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote), then:   (A) the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within  two Business Days) following such termination, pay Parent, by
wire  transfer of immediately available funds, an initial termination 
payment equal to   (x) if at the time of, or at any time within 10 
Business Days prior to, the Company Shareholder Meeting, the  board of
directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or  adversely modified its

Acquisition  Proposal to its shareholders pursuant to clause (iii) of the 
proviso to Section 6.3(a) (either of such actions, a "COMPANY  ADVERSE
ACTION"), three-fifths (3/5) of the Company Termination  Amount, or   (y)
if such a Company Adverse Action shall not have  occurred, one-third (1/3) of
the Company Termination Amount, and   (B) if, prior to or within nine (9)
months following any  such termination a Post-Termination Company Acquisition
Proposal Event  shall have occurred, the Company shall also promptly (and in
any  event within two Business Days after such event) pay Parent, by wire 
transfer of immediately available funds, an additional amount equal  to the
applicable remaining balance of the Company Termination  Amount.   (d) The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.6 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.6 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set
forth in this Section 8.6, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the Company Termination Amount from each date for payment
until the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made plus one (1) percent per
annum. For the avoidance of doubt, approval by the shareholders of the
Company shall not be a condition to the payment of any amount specified in
this Section 8.6.   8.7 Parent Termination Payment.   (a) In the event
that a Pre-Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to Parent
shall have occurred and this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(iii) as a result of an intentional breach by Parent of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then Parent shall pay to the
Company a termination payment equal to (pound)236,000,000 (the "PARENT
TERMINATION AMOUNT"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Such
Parent Termination Amount shall be paid promptly and, in any event, within
two Business Days after the date of such termination.   (b) In the event
that:   (i) a Pre-Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to
Parent shall have occurred and this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(i) (which clause relates to the board of directors of
Parent withdrawing or modifying its recommendation of the Merger and/or any
of the other matters subject to the Parent Votes);   (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(ii)(A) (which clause
relates to a breach under the "no solicitation" or related obligations under
Section 6.3);   (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(ii)(B) by reason of Parent or the board of directors of
Parent recommending an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders pursuant to
clause (iii) of the first proviso to Section 6.3(a); or   (iv) a Pre-
Termination Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to Parent shall have
occurred and this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(iv);   then, in any such event, (A) Parent shall promptly (and in
any event within two Business Days) following such termination, pay
the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
initial termination payment equal to three-fifths (3/5) of the Parent
Termination Amount, and (B) if, prior to or within nine (9) months following
any such termination, (x) Parent executes and delivers an agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (y) the board of directors of Parent
recommends a third-party tender offer or exchange offer for the Parent
Ordinary Shares, or (z) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent
is consummated, then, upon the occurrence of the first such event described
in clause (x), (y) or (z) (a "POST-TERMINATION PARENT ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL EVENT") Parent shall also promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days after such event) pay the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an additional amount equal to two-fifths (2/5)
of the Parent Termination Amount.   (c) In the event that a Pre-Termination
Acquisition Proposal Event with respect to Parent shall have occurred and
this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 8.2(iv) (which clause relates to failure to obtain the Parent Vote),
then:   (A) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two  Business
Days) following such termination, pay the Company, by wire  transfer of
immediately available funds, an initial termination  payment equal to   (x)
if at the time of, or at any time within 10  Business Days prior to, the
Parent Shareholder Meeting, the  Board of Directors of Parent shall have
withdrawn or adversely  modified its approval or recommendation to
shareholders of the  Merger or recommended an Acquisition Proposal to its 
shareholders pursuant to clause (iii) of the first proviso to  Section 6.3(a)
(either of such actions, a "PARENT ADVERSE  ACTION"), three-fifths (3/5) of
the Parent Termination Amount,  or   (y) if such a Parent Adverse Action
shall not have  occurred, one-third (1/3) of the Parent Termination Amount,
and   (B) if, prior to or within nine (9) months following any  such
termination a Post-Termination Parent Acquisition Proposal Event  shall have
occurred, Parent shall also promptly (and in any event  within two Business
Days after such event) pay the Company, by wire  transfer of immediately
available funds, an additional amount equal  to the applicable remaining
balance of the Parent Termination Amount.   (d) Parent acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.7 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.7,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Parent for the payment set forth in this
Section 8.7, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Parent Termination Amount from each date for payment until
the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made plus one (1) percent per annum. For
the avoidance of doubt, approval by the shareholders of Parent shall not be a
condition to the payment of any amount specified in this Section 8.7.   8.8
Pre-Termination Acquisition Proposal Event. For purposes of Sections 8.6 and
8.7, a "PRE-TERMINATION ACQUISITION PROPOSAL EVENT" shall be deemed to occur
with respect to the Company or Parent, as applicable, if, at any time prior
to the event giving rise to the relevant right to terminate this Agreement,
(i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries or made directly
to its shareholders generally or (ii) any Person shall have publicly
announced a bona fide intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal and, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), such Acquisition
Proposal or announcement of intention shall not have been irrevocably
withdrawn.   ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL   9.1 Survival.
