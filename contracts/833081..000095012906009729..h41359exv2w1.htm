PARENT AND BUYER SHALL, ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SYNERGY AND ITS RELATED PERSONS (THE " _SELLER INDEMNITEES_ "), FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL DAMAGES ACTUALLY INCURRED BY ANY SELLER INDEMNITEE ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND THE PETRODRILLS; _provided_ _that_ the indemnification obligations of Parent and Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall not apply to (a) the matters described in Section 7.01(i), (ii) and (iii) or (b) any Damages arising out of or relating to (i) a breach by Synergy or any of its Related Persons of this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other provision that survives Section 6.04 or (ii) any act or omission by Synergy or any of its Related Persons on its own behalf or in its own name (as opposed to on behalf or in the name of the Company or either of the Petrodrills). 

  

 7.03 _Defense of Claims_. Synergy or Parent, whichever is providing indemnification under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), shall have the right to assume the defense of any claim to the extent it is providing indemnification under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, including employing legal counsel. If the Indemnifying Party does not promptly assume the defense of such claim, the indemnified Person may assume the defense of such claim, including employing legal counsel of its choice. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a claim, the indemnified Person has the right to employ at its own expense separate legal counsel and participate in the defense of the claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a claim without its written consent to the settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, the Indemnifying Party may settle the claim, provided it does not agree, without the consent of the indemnified Person, to any compromise or settlement that is not an unconditional release of the indemnified Person from all liabilities other than the payment of any money that will be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The costs of defending any claim by the indemnified Person, if the Indemnifying Party does not promptly assume the defense, shall be treated as Damages for purposes of Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, as applicable. 

  

 7.04 _Notice of Claim_. Each notice of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII delivered by an indemnified Person to an Indemnifying Party shall set forth, with as much specificity as is reasonably practicable, the basis for the claim and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of Damages expected to be payable by the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnifying Party pursuant its indemnification obligation under this Article
VII (which estimate shall not be conclusive or binding in any way). 

   

 7.05 _No Set-off_. The Indemnifying Party may not assert or claim any right of set-off regarding amounts that are owing or are claimed to be owing under this Article VII. 

  

 7.06 _Scope of Indemnities, Releases, Allocations of Liability and Waivers of Remedies, Damages or Recourse_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE PROVISO TO SECTION 7.02, THE INDEMNITIES, RELEASES AND OTHER ALLOCATIONS AND WAIVERS OF, OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON, REMEDIES, LIABILITIES RECOURSE OR OTHER DAMAGES IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT (THE " _LIABILITY LIMITATIONS_ ") SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE), WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, OF THE PERSON ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE THE BENEFIT OF THE LIABILITY LIMITATION OR WHETHER ASSERTED IN CONTRACT, IN WARRANTY, IN TORT, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 TAXES 

   

 8.01 _Liability for Taxes_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall be responsible for filing or causing to be filed all Tax Returns or reports of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and for making or causing to be made any required payments with respect to those returns or reports. 

   

 (b) Unless the Buy-Sell Parties otherwise agree in writing, or unless a Party which is required to prepare a Tax Return shall have received an opinion of counsel that there is no reasonable basis for preparing such return in compliance with the remainder of this sentence, all Tax Returns (including amendments thereto) described in Section 8.01(a) filed after the date of this Agreement for any taxable period ending on or before or including the Closing Date, in the absence of a controlling change in law, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods, conventions and principles of taxation used for the most recent taxable periods for which Tax Returns involving similar matters have been filed. Upon request of a nonresponsible Buy-Sell Party, the party responsible for preparation of a particular Tax Return for such periods under this Section 8.01(b) shall make available a draft of such Tax Return (or relevant portions thereof) for review and comment by such nonresponsible Party. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, all decisions relating to the preparation of Tax Returns shall be made in the sole discretion of the party responsible under this Agreement for such preparation. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any liability for stock transfer Taxes, stamp Taxes or similar Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall be borne by the Company, and the Company shall file, to the extent required by law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) Sellers will cooperate with Buyer to enable the Company and/or either or both of the Petrodrills to elect to be classified for U.S. federal tax purposes as a partnership or a disregarded entity pursuant to Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3 if and when Buyer, in its sole discretion, determines that one or more of such elections will be made and requests such cooperation. If Sellers are required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes solely as a result of an election made pursuant to this Section 8.01(d), Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for those U.S. federal income taxes; provided, however, that this sentence, as applicable to a Seller, shall have no force or effect if that Seller is or has ever been engaged in any U.S. trade or business or is or has ever been otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxes for any reason other than an election made pursuant to this Section 8.01(d). 

  

 8.02 _Cooperation_. Each Party shall provide another Party with any assistance that may reasonably be requested by that other Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing authority or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, and each of the Parties shall retain and provide the requesting party with any records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination, proceedings or determination. The information obtained by each Party pursuant to this Section 8.02 or pursuant to any other Section of this Agreement providing for the sharing of information or review of any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be kept confidential by the Parties.

 11.03 _Entire Agreement; No Waivers_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, provisions, representations, warranties or conditions of this Agreement may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by all of the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect the right of that Party later to enforce that provision. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of the breach of any term, provision, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any written statements, certificates 

   ##### 

  

    

or other such documents to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether by
conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or
construed as (i) a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach, (ii) a waiver of any other condition or breach or (iii) a breach of
any other term, provision, representation or warranty. 

  

 11.04 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF THOSE LAWS THAT WOULD APPLY THE LAWS OF A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION. THE PARTIES HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE CHOSEN COURT FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND AGREE NOT TO COMMENCE ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS EXCEPT IN THE CHOSEN COURT. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE CHOSEN COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE CHOSEN COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TO THE EXTENT THE OBTAINMENT OR ENFORCEMENT OF A REMEDY BEING SOUGHT BY A PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE CHOSEN COURT BECAUSE (A) THE CHOSEN COURT DOES NOT HAVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, (B) THE CHOSEN COURT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GRANT THE REMEDY SOUGHT OR (C) THE JUDGMENT OF THE CHOSEN COURT MAY ONLY BE ENFORCED IN ANOTHER COURT, SUCH REMEDY MAY BE PURSUED OR ENFORCED IN A COURT OTHER THAN THE CHOSEN COURT BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED TO OVERCOME THE APPLICABLE IMPEDIMENT SET FORTH IN ITEM (A), (B) OR (C) OF THIS SENTENCE. 

  

 11.05 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 11.06 _Assignments and Third Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that any Party may, at any time after the Closing, assign its rights but not its obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate. This Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any right in, any duty to, any standard of care with reference to, or any liability to, any person that is not a Party, other than those created by Section 6.04 in favor of the beneficiaries thereof. 

  

 11.07 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon any binding determination that any term or other 

   ##### 

  

    

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the end that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be completed to the extent
possible. 

  

 11.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.
