enter into agreements (the "Share Deposit Agreements") with Offeror of even date
                            ------------------------
herewith.

are hereby acknowledged), the parties covenant and agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   THE OFFER

1.1  The Offer.
     ---------

     (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offeror
          shall make, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any
          event not later than 11:59 p.m. (Calgary time) on March 30, 2001 (the

           ----------
          shares of Genesis and all common shares of Genesis issued on the
          exercise of presently outstanding options to purchase common shares of
          Genesis (collectively the "Common Shares" or the "Genesis Shares") at
                                     -------------          --------------
          a price of Cdn. $18.25 for each Common Share (as amended, varied or
          extended, the "Offer"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offer Date
                         -----
          shall be extended as necessary in the Offeror's sole discretion, but
          not later than April 20, 2001, to permit the preparation and filing of

<PAGE>

                                      -2-



          with the Offer pursuant to all Canadian federal and provincial, United
          States and other applicable securities laws ("Applicable Securities
                                                        ---------------------
          Laws").
          ----

     (b)  The parties agree that the Offeror may make the Offer itself, or
          through one or more of its direct or indirect wholly-owned
          subsidiaries, or any combination thereof (which, for the purposes
          hereof, may include a partnership, all of the partners of which are
          direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Offeror or any combination
          thereof). In the event that any of such entities makes the Offer, the
          terms "Offeror" and "Vintage" as used herein shall include all of such
                 -------       -------
          entities, other than in Article 4 where the terms "Offeror" and
                                                             -------
          "Vintage" shall not include such entities, but the Offeror shall
           -------
          continue to be liable to Genesis for any default in performance by any
          such party.

     (c)  The Offer shall be made in accordance with all applicable laws and
          shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 1.1(c)
          hereto. The Offer shall not expire, and the Offeror shall not take up
          and pay for Common Shares, prior to 12:00 p.m. midnight (Vancouver
          time) on the 21st day from the Offer Date; or if such day is not a
          business day, the next business day, provided that the Offer may be
          extended one or more times at the sole discretion of the Offeror, if
          the conditions set forth in Schedule 1.1(c) are not satisfied or
          waived at the date and time at which the Offer otherwise would expire
          (the "Expiry Time") and further provided that if at the Expiry Time
                -----------
          condition (d) of Schedule 1.1(c) alone or together with one or more
          other conditions is not satisfied, the Offeror shall extend the Offer
          in one or more extensions and the Offer may not be terminated or
          allowed to expire solely as a result of such non-satisfaction of
          conditions in Schedule 1.1(c) prior to 12:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on
          the 45th day from the Offer Date. Subject to the satisfaction or
          waiver of the conditions set forth in Schedule 1.1(c), the Offeror
          shall, on or before the third day following the date that the
          conditions set forth in Schedule 1.1(c) are satisfied and the Offeror
          is duly authorized under applicable law, accept for payment and pay
          for all Common Shares validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn)
          pursuant to the Offer. The Offeror shall use reasonable commercial
          efforts to consummate the Offer, subject only to the terms and
          conditions thereof and this Agreement. The Offeror agrees not to vary
          the Offer, except to increase the consideration payable thereunder,
          waive the conditions or extend the Expiry Time, provided that the
          Minimum Condition (as defined in Schedule 1.1(c)) may not be waived
          without the prior written consent of Genesis, such consent not to be
          unreasonably withheld.

                    referred to in Sections 2.6 and 5.25.

     (b)  The foregoing conditions are for the exclusive benefit of the Offeror
          and may be waived by the Offeror, in whole or in part, in its sole
          discretion, at any time and from time to time, both before or after
          the Expiry Time.

1.3  Genesis Action.
     --------------

     (a)  Genesis represents and warrants to the Offeror that the Genesis Board
          has received the oral fairness opinion of its financial advisors (to
          be confirmed in writing prior to the mailing of the directors'
          circular to be mailed in connection with the Offer (the "Directors'
                                                                   ----------
          Circular")) that the Offer is fair from a financial point of view to
          --------
          the holders of the Common Shares (the "Shareholders") and that the
                                                 ------------
          Genesis Board, upon receipt of the oral fairness opinion and
          consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has determined
          unanimously, by those present at the meeting, that:

          (i)       the Offer is fair to the Shareholders and is in the best
                    interests of Genesis and the Shareholders;

          (ii)      the Genesis Board will recommend that Shareholders accept
                    the Offer; and

          (iii)     the entering into of this Agreement, which the Offeror has
                    expressly stated is a mandatory precondition to its
                    willingness to make the Offer, is in the best interests of
                    Genesis and the Shareholders.

     (b)  Genesis shall co-operate with the Offeror, take all reasonable action

          prior to the mailing thereof, on a confidential basis, and shall
          provide the Offeror with a reasonable opportunity to review and
          provide any comments thereon. Genesis shall use its reasonable
          commercial efforts to mail the Directors' Circular on the same date
          that the Offeror mails the Offer to the Shareholders (and no later
          than 10 days from such mailing date). Genesis shall also file the
          Directors' Circular on a timely basis with all applicable securities
          commissions or other regulatory authorities in Canada, the United
          States and elsewhere, as applicable (the "Regulatory Authorities").

          The Directors' Circular will set forth, among other things, the
          determinations and recommendations of the Genesis Board as set forth
          in Section 1.3(a).

     (c)  Genesis represents that all members of the Genesis Board have advised

     efforts to enable the Offeror to elect or appoint nominees of the Offeror
     in their stead as soon as possible after the Offeror takes up and pays for
     at least 66% of the Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and to cause the
     appointment of the Offeror's nominees to fill the vacancies so created in
     order to effect the foregoing without the necessity of a shareholder
     meeting.

     ------------------------------------
     manager in connection with the Offer and solicit acceptances of the Offer.

     -------------------------
     efforts, having regard, without limitation, to its available bank lines, to
     enter into agreements with all holders of options to the effect that in
     lieu of such persons exercising their options, Genesis will pay to such
     persons the difference between the exercise price of their options and the
     purchase price for the Common Shares under the Offer immediately after the
     Offeror first takes up any Common Shares pursuant to the Offer in exchange
     for the termination of their options. To the extent that holders fail to
     enter into such agreements, Genesis shall use all reasonable commercial
     efforts to ensure that all options, whether issued pursuant to Genesis'
     stock option plan and other compensation arrangements or otherwise, are no
     later than immediately prior to the Expiry Time, either: (i) exercised and
     all Common Shares issued in connection therewith are deposited to the
     Offer; or (ii) terminated, surrendered or cancelled. Genesis further agrees
     and represents that the Genesis Board has also resolved, and has authorized
     and directed Genesis, subject to the
<PAGE>

                                      -6-

     receipt of any required regulatory approvals, (i) to the extent necessary,
     to amend the terms of its stock option plan and other compensation
     arrangements to permit and to cause the vesting of option entitlements

     all Common Shares that are fully paid thereunder to be distributed to those
     persons entitled thereto so as to be able to be tendered to the Offer (iii)
     to satisfy all other obligations of Genesis under such plans; and (iv)
     effective upon receiving notice from the Offeror that the Minimum Condition
     has been satisfied or waived, and immediately after the Offeror takes up
     Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, to use reasonable commercial efforts
     to cause all option entitlements under the stock option plan and any other
     compensation arrangements to terminate upon the payment of an amount for
     each outstanding option equal to the difference between the exercise price
     thereof and the Offer price.

          unreasonably withheld.

2.2  Non-Solicitation by Genesis.
     ---------------------------

     (a)  Genesis shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
          director, promoter, employee, representative or agent of Genesis or
          any Subsidiary or otherwise:

          (i)       solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way
                    of furnishing information or entering into any form of
                    agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation or
                    continuation of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations,
                    proposals or offers regarding any merger, amalgamation,
                    arrangement, take-over bid, sale of substantial assets, sale
                    of treasury shares or any similar transaction involving
                    Genesis or any Subsidiary (any of the foregoing inquiries or
                    proposals, other than from the Offeror or its nominees,
                    representatives or agents, being referred to herein as an
                    "Acquisition Proposal");
                     --------------------

          (ii)      continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations
                    relating to any such transactions with, or otherwise
                    cooperate with or assist or facilitate, encourage or
                    participate in any effort to take such action by, or provide
                    any information to, any corporation, person or other entity
                    or group; or

          (iii)     waive or otherwise forebear in the enforcement of, or enter
                    into or participate in any discussions, negotiations or
                    agreements to waive or otherwise forebear in respect of, any
                    rights or other benefits of Genesis under confidentiality or
                    other agreements, including any "standstill" provisions
                    therein;

          provided, that nothing contained in this Section 2.2(a) shall prevent
          the Genesis Board from responding to and recommending to the
          Shareholders an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for
          which adequate financial arrangements have been made which the Genesis
          Board determines in good faith (after
<PAGE>

                                      -10-

          consultation with its financial advisors, and after receiving advice
          of outside counsel that is reflected in the minutes of the Genesis
          Board, to the effect that the Genesis Board is required to so
          determine in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties) would,
          if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction
          financially superior for the Shareholders than the transaction
          contemplated by this Agreement (any such Acquisition Proposal being
          referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal").
                                   -----------------

     (b)  Genesis shall immediately notify the Offeror of any future Acquisition
          Proposal or any request following the date hereof for non-public
          information relating to Genesis in connection with an Acquisition
          Proposal or for access to any of its properties, books or records by
          any person or entity that informs Genesis that it is considering
          making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the
          Offeror shall be made, from time to time, orally and in writing and
          shall indicate such details of the proposal, inquiry or contact known
          to Genesis as the identity of the person making such proposal, inquiry
          or contact, the consideration offered and such other details as the
          Offeror may reasonably request.

     (c)  If Genesis receives a request for material non-public information from
          a party who proposes to Genesis a bona fide Acquisition Proposal and
          Genesis Board determines that such proposal is a Superior Proposal
          pursuant to Section 2.2(a), then and only in such case, Genesis may,
          subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement substantially
          similar to the confidentiality agreement between the Offeror and
          Genesis dated February 26, 2001, a copy of which is attached hereto as
          Schedule 2.2(c) (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), provide such party
                                --------------------------
          with access to information regarding Genesis. Genesis shall provide to
          the Offeror a true and complete copy of any such confidentiality
          agreement forthwith following its execution and make available to the
          Offeror all information provided to such party that has not been
          previously provided to the Offeror concurrently with the provision of
          any information to such party.

     (d)  Genesis shall ensure that the officers, directors and employees of
          Genesis and of all Subsidiaries, the associates and affiliates of such
          persons and any investment banker, other advisor and representative
          retained by Genesis are aware of the provisions of this Section 2.2,
          and Genesis shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 2.2 by
          any of the foregoing.

     (e)  Genesis shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
          directors, officers, promoters, employees, representatives and agents
          to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions and
          negotiations, if any, with any parties (other than the Offeror) with
          respect to any actual, future or potential Acquisition Proposal, and
          Genesis shall immediately close any data rooms. Genesis agrees not to
          release any third party from any confidentiality or standstill

          Genesis or its agents or advisors or destroy all information provided
          to such party by Genesis or its agents or advisors or prepared by such
          party in respect of Genesis and shall use all reasonable efforts to
          ensure that such requests are honoured. Genesis shall immediately
          advise the Offeror orally and in written form of any response or
          action by any recipient of such information which Genesis reasonably
          believes could adversely affect the completion of the Offer, or give
          rise to an Acquisition Proposal.

2.3  Access to Information.  Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Genesis
     ---------------------
     shall afford the Offeror's officers, employees, counsel, investment
     bankers, accountants and other authorized representatives and advisors
     access, at all reasonable times, from the date hereof and until the
     expiration of this Agreement, to its business, properties, books, contracts
     and records as well as to its management personnel, and, during such
     period, Genesis shall furnish promptly to the Offeror all information
     concerning its business, properties and personnel as the Offeror may
     reasonably request. All such requests for access or information shall be
     through either the President or the Chairman and Senior Vice President of
     Genesis.

2.4  Market Purchases.  Genesis agrees that the Offeror, notwithstanding
     ----------------
     anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, during
     the period the Offer is outstanding may purchase Common Shares through the
     facilities of The Toronto Stock Exchange or such other method(s) which are
     not prohibited by Applicable Securities Laws.

2.5  Structure of Transaction.  Genesis shall cooperate with the Offeror in
     ------------------------
     structuring the acquisition by the Offeror of Genesis pursuant to the Offer
     in a tax efficient manner.

     ------------------------
     dates set out in Section 1.2(v), Share Deposit Agreements duly executed by
     each of the Agreeing Shareholders, substantially in the form attached as
     Schedule 2.6. The Directors' Circular shall reflect the execution and
     delivery of such Share Deposit Agreements and the agreement of the Agreeing
     Shareholders to tender their respective Common Shares to the Offer.

2.7  Transition.  Genesis shall, on or before the date that the Offeror first
     ----------
     takes up Common Shares under the Offer, furnish promptly to the Offeror all
     information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Genesis as
     the Offeror may reasonably request and review with the Offeror's authorized
     personnel such of the records, systems and processes as would be necessary
     to allow the Offeror's authorized personnel to assume the continuing
     operations of Genesis.

                          FEES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS

3.1  Compensation Fee.  If at any time after the time of execution of this
     ----------------
     Agreement:

     (a)  Genesis Board has withdrawn or, in any manner adverse to the Offeror,
          redefined, modified or changed any of its recommendations, approvals,
          resolutions or determinations referred to in Sections 1.3, 1.6 and 1.9
          or has resolved to do so;

     (b)  Genesis Board has failed to reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer
          to Shareholders by press release within five days after the public
          announcement or commencement of any Acquisition Proposal made prior to
          the Expiry Time and in a Directors' Circular within 10 days after the
          mailing of any such Acquisition Proposal;

     (c)  Genesis Board has recommended that Shareholders deposit their Common
          Shares under, vote in favour of, or otherwise accept, an Acquisition
          Proposal;

     (d)  Genesis has entered into an agreement (other than a confidentiality
          agreement substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement) with
          any person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal to be made prior to
          the Expiry Time;

     (e)  a Superior Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made
          to the Shareholders or to Genesis and at the Expiry Time the Minimum
          Condition (as defined in Schedule 1.1(c) to this Agreement) of the
          Offer has not been satisfied; or

     (f)  Genesis breaches in any material respect representations, warranties
          or covenants made by it in this Agreement,

     then Genesis shall promptly pay to the Offeror an amount which is equal to
     4% of the value (calculated based on the offer price per Common Share
     multiplied by the number of Common Shares outstanding on a fully diluted
     basis, plus all bank debt and all long term debt including the current
     portion thereof, without duplication) of the Offer or, if a Superior
     Proposal has been announced, proposed, offered or made, of the Superior
     Proposal or Superior Proposals having the highest value from time to time
     considered by Genesis, whether or not there is in fact a Superior Proposal,
     to compensate the Offeror for facilitating a higher offer for Genesis.
     Such payment shall be made in immediately available funds, within two
     business days after the first to occur of the events described above.  In
     the event there is more than one Superior Proposal, or a Superior Proposal
     is proposed to Genesis for the first time after a fee has been paid to the
     Offeror pursuant to this Section 3.1, then the fee required to be paid
     hereby shall be recalculated and any incremental fee shall be paid to the
     Offeror within two business days after the event that gives rise to the
     recalculation.

                                      -13-

3.2  Right of First Refusal and Property Option.  Genesis will not enter into
     ------------------------------------------
     any agreement regarding a Superior Proposal (the "Proposed Agreement")
                                                       ------------------
     without providing Offeror with the full details of the Proposed Agreement
     and with an opportunity of not less than 72 hours to amend this Agreement
     to provide at least as favourable or more favourable terms to the
     Shareholders than those to be included in the Proposed Agreement, including
     a cash price per share for the outstanding Common Shares, on a fully
     diluted basis, not less than the cash price per share in the Proposed
     Agreement. In particular, Genesis covenants to provide the Offeror with a
     true and complete copy of any Proposed Agreement at least 72 hours prior to
     its proposed execution by Genesis and to immediately provide to the Offeror
     a true and complete copy of any Proposed Agreement executed. In the event
     the Offeror agrees to and does amend this Agreement as provided above
     within such 72 hour period, Genesis covenants to not enter into the
     Proposed Agreement. In the event, however, that either: (i) Genesis enters
     into an agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement substantially
     similar to the Confidentiality Agreement) with any person with respect to a
     Superior Proposal to be made prior to the Expiry Time; or (ii) any person
     (other that the Offeror) takes up and pays for any Genesis Shares pursuant
     to an Acquisition Proposal announced prior to the Expiry Time; then, the
     Offeror shall have the right, at its option, exercisable by written notice
     given within 180 days of the occurrence of either such event, to purchase
     for cash at a price in cash that the property would have brought at the
     time of the exercise if then offered for sale in the open market by a
     seller under no compulsion to sell (the "Fair Market Value") one or more
                                              -----------------
     of the following:

                                                                       -----
          NWT") together with Genesis' interest in the Genesis Energy
          ---
          partnership (the "Partnership") with Genex NWT, together with Genesis'

     Closing of the purchase and sale of any of the above will occur as soon as
     reasonable possible after the Offeror and Genesis have reached agreement as
     to applicable Fair Market Value.  If agreement as to Fair Market Value has
     not been reached within 30 days following exercise of the option, either
     the Offeror or Genesis may submit the matter of the determination of Fair
     Market Value to binding arbitration in Calgary, Alberta in accordance with
     the Arbitration Act (Alberta).

     ------------------------
     advised Genesis that he intends to, and each has been advised by his
     associates and affiliates that each of them intends to, tender his, her or

5.29 Subsequent Public Filings.  Between the date hereof and the Expiry Time,
     -------------------------
     Genesis will deliver to the Offeror as soon as they become available true
     and complete copies of any report or statement filed by it with Regulatory
     Authorities subsequent to the date hereof. As of their respective dates,
     such reports and statements (excluding any information therein provided
     solely by the Offeror): (i) will not contain any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) will
     comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law
     including Applicable Securities Laws. The financial statements of Genesis
     issued by Genesis or to be included in such reports and statements will be

     operations and changes in financial position of Genesis as of the dates
     thereof and for the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of any
     unaudited interim financial statements, to non-material, customary year-end
     audit adjustments). Between the date hereof and the Expiry Time, Genesis
     will also deliver to the Offeror as soon as they become available copies of
     any press releases issued by Genesis.

5.30 Insurance.  Policies of insurance in force as of the date hereof naming
     ---------
     Genesis as an insured adequately cover all risks reasonably and prudently
     foreseeable in the direct or indirect operation and conduct of the business
     of Genesis which are insurable on reasonable economic terms and as would be
     customary in respect of the business carried on by Genesis. All such
     policies of insurance shall remain in force and effect and shall not be
     cancelled or otherwise terminated as a result of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer.

5.31 Confidentiality Agreements.  True and complete copies of all agreements
     --------------------------
     entered into by Genesis with persons other than the Offeror regarding the
     confidentiality of information provided to such persons or reviewed by such

5.32 Labor and Employee Relations.
     ----------------------------
     (a)  There exists no collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
          contract applicable to any employees of Genesis and no such agreement
          or contract has been directly or indirectly requested by any employee
          or group of employees of Genesis, nor has there been any discussion
          with respect thereto by management of Genesis with any of its
          employees. Genesis has not received any written notification of any
          unfair labor practice charges or complaints pending before any agency
          having jurisdiction thereof nor are there any current union
          representation claims involving any employees of Genesis and Genesis
          is not aware of any such threatened charges or claims.

     (b)  Genesis is not aware of any union organizing activities or proceedings
          involving, or any pending petitions for recognition of, a labor union
          or association as the exclusive bargaining agent for, or where the
          purpose is to organize, any group or
<PAGE>

                                      -27-



          groups of its employees. There is not currently pending, with regard
          to any of its facilities, any proceeding before the applicable
          Canadian agency wherein any labor organization is seeking
          representation of any employees of Genesis.

     (c)  Genesis is not aware of any strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or
          lockouts nor of any threats thereof, by or with respect to any of its
          employees.

5.33 Absence of Certain Business Practices.  Neither Genesis nor to Genesis'
     -------------------------------------
     knowledge any of its officers, employees or agents, nor any other person
     acting on their behalf, has, directly or indirectly, within the past five
     years, given or agreed to give any gift or similar benefit to any customer,
     supplier, government employee or other person who is or may be in a
     position to help or hinder the business of Genesis (or to assist Genesis
     with any actual or proposed transaction) which (i) might subject Genesis to
     any damage or penalty in any civil, criminal or governmental litigation or
     proceeding, (ii) if not given in the past, might have had a material
     adverse effect on the assets, business or operations of Genesis, or (iii)
     if not continued in the future, might materially adversely affect the
     assets, business operations or prospects of Genesis or which might subject
     Genesis to suit or penalty in a private or governmental litigation or
     proceeding.

5.34 Engineering Reports.  Genesis has provided to Outtrim Szabo Associates
     -------------------
     Ltd., independent geological and petroleum engineering consultants (the
     "Independent Engineer"), all material information concerning land
      --------------------
     descriptions and well data respecting at least 90% of the oil and gas
     assets of Genesis at December 31, 2000 in respect of the evaluation reports
     dated February 22, 2001 (collectively, the "Reserve Reports") and, in
                                                 ---------------
     particular, all material information respecting Genesis' interests in such
     oil and gas assets and all rentals, royalties, overriding royalty
     interests, production payments, net profits interest burdens and other
     payments due or payable with respect thereto and Genesis is not aware
     (after due inquiry) of any information not provided to the Independent
     Engineer that would have a material adverse impact on the evaluation
     report, taken as a whole.

          right, title and interest in and to all properties and assets directly

          in Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories) and no such property,
          asset or interest is subject to any lien, mortgage, pledge, security,
          interest, charge, claim or demand or encumbrance of any kind, whether

          material to the operation of its other properties, assets and
          businesses and all such agreements are valid and subsisting and are in
          full force and effect and there exists no default under any provision
          of any agreement which would permit any of the other parties
          thereunder to terminate any such agreement or to exercise any rights
          under such agreement, except those that would not have a material
          adverse effect on the business, affairs, operations, assets, prospects
          or financial condition of Genesis, or on the ability of Genesis to
          consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

          hydrocarbon production from any of its assets after the date hereof.

     -------------------
     renounce exploration and development expenses in the full amount of any

                                   ARTICLE 6
                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, including the Offer, and to cooperate with each other in
     connection with the foregoing, including using reasonable commercial
     efforts to: (i) obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations
     as are required to be obtained under any federal, provincial or foreign law
     or regulations; (ii) defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings
     challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

     understanding relating to Genesis' operations); and (vi) fulfill all
     conditions and satisfy all provisions of this Agreement and the Offer.

     For purposes of the foregoing, the obligation of Genesis and the Offeror to
     use "reasonable commercial efforts" to obtain waivers, consents and

     -----------------
     party shall pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the matters
     contemplated in this Agreement.

6.4  Employment Contracts.  The Offeror agrees that, if it takes up and pays for
     --------------------
     Common Shares under the Offer, it will cause Genesis to fulfill its
     obligations pursuant to employment contracts between Genesis and those
     employees of Genesis (true and correct copies of written employment
     contracts have been provided to the Offeror prior to the date hereof) who
     are meeting the terms of their employment; provided, that this Section 6.4
     shall not restrict or prohibit the Offeror from dissolving Genesis,
     reorganizing the capital of Genesis, transferring the assets of Genesis to
     another entity, causing Genesis to assume the liabilities of another
     entity, or otherwise reorganizing or restructuring Genesis or its
     businesses if, as part of such transaction or reorganization, the Offeror
     causes the obligations under this Section 6.4 to be assumed by the Offeror
     or an entity controlled by the Offeror that has a net worth substantially

     efforts to secure directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for
     Genesis' current and former directors and officers on a three year
     "trailing" or "run off" basis from and after the Expiry Time. If a trailing
      --------      -------
     policy is not available, then the Offeror agrees that, for the entire
     period from the Expiry Time until three years after the Expiry Time, the
     Offeror will cause Genesis or any successor to Genesis to maintain Genesis'
     current directors' and officers' insurance policy (a true and correct copy
     of which Genesis has provided to the Offeror prior to the date hereof) or
     an equivalent policy. The terms and conditions of all policies referred to
     in this Section 6.5 shall be no less advantageous to the directors and
     officers of Genesis than those contained in the policy in effect on the
     date hereof, for all present and former directors and officers of Genesis,
     covering claims made prior to or within three years after the Expiry Time.

     ------------------------------------------------------
     hereof until the termination of this Agreement, Genesis shall immediately
     notify the Offeror in written form of:

     (a)  any material change (actual, anticipated, contemplated or threatened,
          financial or otherwise) in the business, affairs, operations, assets,
          liabilities (contingent or otherwise) or capital of Genesis or any
          Subsidiary;

     (b)  any material change in or untruth of any representation or warranty

          be complied with in all material respects.

     Genesis shall provide the Offeror with reasonable details of the material
     change, untruth or non-compliance.  Genesis shall in good faith discuss
     with the Offeror any change in circumstances (actual, anticipated,
     contemplated or threatened, financial or otherwise) which is of such a
     nature that there may be a reasonable question as to whether notice needs
     to be given to the Offeror pursuant to this Section 6.6.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                    TERM, TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     Sections 3.1, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5, may be terminated by written notice
     promptly given to the other party hereto, at any time prior to the time the

     (a)  by the Offeror, if the conditions set forth in (i)
          Section 1.2(a)(iii) -(v) have not been satisfied or waived by the
          Offeror by April 20, 2001, or (ii) Schedule 1.1(c) have not been
          satisfied or waived by the Offeror on or before the Expiry Time,
          subject to the obligation to extend set out in Section 1.1(c);

     (b)  by the Offeror, if the Genesis Board shall withdraw, modify or change
          any recommendation regarding the Offer in a manner adverse to the
          Offeror, in accordance with Section 2.2(a), in which event the fee set
          forth in Section 3.1 shall become due and payable by Genesis to the
          Offeror;
<PAGE>

                                      -32-

     (c)  by Genesis, if the Offeror has not taken up and paid for the Common
          Shares deposited under the Offer on or before that date which is 45
          days following the date of mailing of the Offer;

     (d)  by either the Offeror or Genesis, if the Offer terminates or expires
          at the Expiry Time without the Offeror taking up and paying for any of
          the Common Shares as a result of the failure of any condition set
          forth in Schedule 1.1(c) which has not been waived;

     (e)  by either the Offeror or Genesis, in the event that the other of them
          shall not have complied with or performed, in all material respects,
          its covenants and obligations under this Agreement to be complied with
          or performed at or prior to the Expiry Time, or any of the
          representations and warranties of the other of them under this
          Agreement are not true and correct in all material respects at or
          prior to the Expiry Time, in which event, if Genesis is the party in
          breach, the fee set forth in Section 3.1 shall become due and payable
          by Genesis to the Offeror;

     (f)  by either the Offeror or Genesis, in the event that the fee
          contemplated in Section 3.1 shall have been paid by Genesis to the

     (g)  by mutual written consent of Genesis and the Offeror.

7.3  Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of this Agreement

     there shall be no liability on the part of Offeror or Genesis hereunder,
     except as set forth in Section 3.1, and this Section 7.3. Nothing contained
     in this Section 7.3 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach
     of any provision of this Agreement prior to the termination hereof and from
     any obligation to pay the fee set forth in Section 3.1. No termination of
     this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties pursuant to the
     Confidentiality Agreement, except to the extent specified therein.

                            CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER
                            -----------------------

          The capitalized terms used in this Schedule have the meanings set
forth in the Acquisition Agreement.  In addition, "fully diluted" for the
                                                   -------------
purposes hereof shall mean all outstanding Common Shares plus any Common Shares
issuable upon the exercise of options or other securities convertible into or
exercisable for Common Shares or pursuant to entitlements pursuant to any stock

          Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to
Section 1.1(c) of the Acquisition Agreement, the Offeror shall not be required
to accept for payment, purchase or pay for any Common Shares tendered, and may
terminate the Offer or amend the Offer to postpone the acceptance for payment
of, and payment for, Common Shares tendered, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied or waived prior to the Expiry Time:

     (a)  prior to the Expiry Time and at the time the Offeror first takes up
          and pays for Common Shares under the Offer, there shall have been
          validly deposited under the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Common
          Shares which constitutes at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding Common
          Shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis), other than Common Shares
          owned at the date of the Offer by the Offeror, its associates and
          affiliates or by persons whose Common Shares may not be included as
          part of the minority approval of a subsequent acquisition transaction
          (the "Minimum Condition");

     (b)  any applicable waiting periods under any competition, merger control
          or similar law, regulation or other governmental authority having
          direct or indirect jurisdiction over the Offeror, Genesis or the Offer
          or any other transaction contemplated by the Offer with respect to any
          such matters shall have expired or been terminated in respect of such
          transactions;

     (c)  the Acquisition Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to
          its terms;

     (d)  all other regulatory approvals, orders, rulings, exemptions, consents
          and waiting periods (including, without limitation, under the
          Competition Act (Canada), the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements
          Act of 1976 (United States) (if applicable) and the Investment Canada
          Act (Canada) and those of any stock exchanges or securities or other
          regulatory authorities) which, in the sole judgment of the Offeror,
          are necessary shall have been obtained on terms and conditions
          satisfactory to Offeror in its sole discretion, acting reasonably, and
          all applicable statutory or regulatory waiting periods shall have
          expired or been terminated and the Offeror shall have determined in
          its sole judgment, acting reasonably, that no unresolved material
          objection or opposition shall have been filed, initiated or made
          during any applicable statutory or regulatory period and no
<PAGE>

                                      -2-

          proceedings shall have been taken or threatened under the merger
          provisions of Part VIII under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect
          of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
          limitation, the Offer;

     (e)  no act, action, suit or proceeding shall have been threatened or taken
          before or by any domestic or foreign court or tribunal or governmental
          agency or other regulatory authority or administrative agency or
          commission by any elected or appointed public official or by any
          private person in Canada or elsewhere, whether or not having the force
          of law, and no law, regulation or policy shall have been proposed,
          enacted, promulgated or applied, whether or not having the force of
          law:

          (i)    which, in the sole judgment of the Offeror, acting reasonably,
                 has the effect or may have the effect to cease trade, enjoin,
                 prohibit or impose material limitations, damages or conditions
                 on the purchase by, or the sale to, the Offeror, of the Common
                 Shares or the right of the Offeror to own or exercise full
                 rights of ownership of the Common Shares, or the ability of the
                 Offeror to complete a compulsory acquisition or any subsequent

          (ii)   which, in the sole judgment of the Offeror, acting reasonably,
                 has had or may have a material adverse effect on Genesis or the
                 Offeror or the Offeror's ability to effect a compulsory
                 acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction;

     (f)  the Offeror shall have determined in its sole judgment, acting
          reasonably, that there does not exist any prohibition at law against
          the Offeror making the Offer or taking up and paying for all of the
          Common Shares under the Offer or completing any compulsory acquisition
          or subsequent acquisition transaction;

     (g)  the Offeror shall have determined in its sole judgment, acting
          reasonably, that Genesis has not, directly or indirectly, taken or
          proposed to take any action, or publicly disclosed that it intends to
          take any action, and the Offeror shall not have otherwise learned of
          any previous action taken by Genesis, directly or indirectly, which
          had not been publicly disclosed prior to the announcement of the
          Offer, that would be materially adverse to the business of Genesis or
          the value of the Common Shares to the Offeror or that would make it
          inadvisable for the Offeror to proceed with the Offer or with taking
          up and paying for Common Shares under the Offer or completing any
          compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction
          including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
          action with respect to any agreement, proposal, offer or understanding
          relating to any material sale, disposition or other dealing with any
          of its direct or indirect assets (other than any such sale,
          disposition or other dealing between Genesis and a Subsidiary), any
          issue of shares, options or other securities of Genesis to any person
          (other than a Subsidiary), or any material acquisition from a third
          party of
<PAGE>

                                      -3-

          assets or securities by Genesis, or any material capital expenditure
          by Genesis not in the ordinary course of business;

     (h)  there shall not have occurred (and there shall not have been publicly
          disclosed, and the Offeror shall not have otherwise learned of, if
          previously not publicly disclosed) any direct or indirect change (or
          any condition, event or development involving a prospective change)
          not publicly disclosed prior to the announcement of the Offer in the
          business, operations, assets, capitalization, financial condition,
          licences, permits, rights, liabilities, prospects or privileges,
          whether contractual or otherwise, of Genesis (other than (A) arising
          out of a matter which has been disclosed in a document filed on SEDAR
          or in the Disclosure Letter or in the Acquisition Agreement; (B)
          resulting from conditions affecting the oil and gas industry in the
          jurisdictions in which Genesis holds its assets, taken as whole,
          including, without limitation, changes, actual or prospective, in
          commodity prices; or (C) resulting from general economic, financial,
          currency exchange, securities or commodity market conditions in Canada
          or elsewhere) which, in the sole judgment of the Offeror, acting
          reasonably, is materially adverse to the business of Genesis or to the
          value of the Common Shares to the Offeror;

     (i)  the Offeror shall have determined in its sole judgment, acting
          reasonably, that: (i) no material right, franchise or licence of
          Genesis has been or may be impaired (which impairment has not been
          cured or waived) or otherwise adversely affected, whether as a result
          of the making of the Offer, the taking up and paying for Common Shares
          deposited under the Offer or otherwise which might make it inadvisable
          for the Offeror to proceed with the Offer or with the taking up and
          paying for the Common Shares under the Offer or completing a
          compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction (other
          than (A) arising out of a matter which has been disclosed in a
          document filed on SEDAR or in the Disclosure Letter or in the
          Acquisition Agreement; (B) resulting from conditions affecting the oil
          and gas industry in the jurisdictions in which Genesis holds its
          assets, taken as whole, including, without limitation, changes, actual
          or prospective, in commodity prices; or (C) resulting from general
          economic, financial, currency exchange, securities or commodity market
          conditions in Canada or elsewhere); and (ii) no covenant, term or
          condition of any instruments or agreements of Genesis exists which
          might make it inadvisable for the Offeror to proceed with the Offer or
          with the taking up and paying for the Common Shares under the Offer or
          completing a compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition
          transaction (including, without limitation, any default, acceleration
          or other adverse event that may ensue as a result of the Offeror
          taking up and paying for the Common Shares under the Offer or
          completing a compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition
          transaction);

     (j)  there shall not have occurred any actual or threatened change
          (including any proposal by the Minister of Finance (Canada) to amend
          the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any announcement governmental or
          regulatory initiative, condition,

          event or development involving a change or a prospective change) other
          than the implementation of a change announced prior to March 26, 2001
          that, in the sole judgment of the Offeror, acting reasonably, directly
          or indirectly, has or may reasonably be expected to have material
          adverse effect with respect to the current or anticipated business or
          operations of any of the Offeror or Genesis and their respective
          subsidiaries or entities in which either of them has a material
          interest or with respect to the regulatory regime applicable to their
          respective businesses and operations or with respect to completing any
          compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction or with
          respect to any potential integration of Genesis with the Offeror or
          any subsidiary, associate or affiliate of the Offeror or any
          reorganization of the Offeror or Genesis in connection with any such
          potential integration;

     (k)  there shall not have occurred any material breach by Genesis of any of
          the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or any termination of the
          Acquisition Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition
          Agreement or any material breach by an Agreeing Shareholder of any of
          the terms of the Share Deposit Agreement or any provision of this
          Agreement or of the Share Deposit Agreement shall have been held by a
          court, securities commission or other regulatory authority to be
          invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms or any of the
          representations and warranties of Genesis under the Agreement are not
          true and correct in all material respects at the Expiry Time; and

          the written confirmation of Genesis that: (i) Genesis has not
          breached, or failed to comply with, in any material respect, any of
          its covenants under this Agreement; and (ii) the representations and
          warranties of Genesis contained in this Agreement are true and correct
          in all material respects at and as of the Expiry Time.

and may be waived by the Offeror, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion,
